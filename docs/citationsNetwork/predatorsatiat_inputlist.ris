TI  - Effect of climate change on mast‐seeding species: frequency of mass flowering and escape from specialist insect seed predators
PY  - 1998
AB  - Global surface temperatures are expected to increase by several degrees in the next century, with potentially large but poorly understood impacts on ecological interactions. Here we propose potential effects of increased temperatures on ecologically dominant New Zealand grasses (Chionochloa spp.) that mass flower and mast seed. Twenty-two years’ data from five masting Chionochloa species in New Zealand showed that the cue for heavy flowering was unusually high temperature in the summer of the year before flowering. Attack by predispersal insect seed predators was much reduced in mast years, apparently because predator populations were satiated. Increased temperatures would greatly decrease interannual variation in Chionochloa flowering, allowing seed predator populations to increase and potentially to devastate the seed crop annually. Similar responses are likely in masting species worldwide. This previously unrecognized effect of global warming could have widespread impacts on temperate ecosystems.

TI  - Prolonged diapause and seed predation by the acorn weevil, Curculio robustus, in relation to masting of the deciduous oak Quercus acutissima
PY  - 2016
AB  - Many researchers have studied the relationship between masting by trees and seed predation by insects. Most of these studies have been plant centered, with little focus on the insect perspective. To estimate the effect of mast seeding on insect seed predators, the life-history traits of these insects must also be considered because some seed insects can survive lean years by prolonged diapause. In this study, I examined larval infestation of acorns and life-history traits of the acorn weevil, Curculio robustus (Roelofs) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in relation to acorn production of the deciduous oak Quercus acutissima Carruthers (Fagaceae) in a coppice stand in central Japan in 2004–2009. Curculio robustus females oviposit into Q. acutissima acorns, inside which the larvae develop. Mature larvae leave acorns and burrow into the soil, where they overwinter. Although germination did occur in acorns infested by weevil larvae, the percentage of germination was lower in acorns damaged by many larvae. Acorn production in Q. acutissima varied considerably among years. Both the number of C. robustus larvae infesting acorns and the percentage of acorns infested were affected by the amount of acorns produced by Q. acutissima, and two successive lean years appeared to have a considerable impact on C. robustus population size. Consequently, only a small fraction of the acorns produced were lost to predation in a mast year after two successive lean years. However, C. robustus could survive the two successive lean years because of prolonged larval diapause, probably leading to a marked decrease in population size. These findings suggest that masting in Q. acutissima succeeds as a predator satiation strategy in response to acorn damage by C. robustus, and that C. robustus has developed prolonged diapause as a counter-adaptation.

TI  - Evolutionary advantages of mast seeding in Fagus crenata
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary


1
Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolutionary advantages of mast seeding (the intermittent production of large crops of flowers or seeds by a population of perennial plants). Mast seeding could have evolved as a result of increased pollination efficiency in mast-flowering years and/or as an anti-predator adaptation that increases the survival of seeds by alternately starving seed predators in non-mast years and satiating them in mast years.

2
We investigated annual seed crops to test the relative contributions of pollination efficiency and pre-dispersal predator satiation to mast seeding in Fagus crenata, a tall tree species dominating cool-temperate forests in Japan. Thirteen-year (1990–2002) time series data were collected for five beech forests in south-western Hokkaido.

3
The negative relationship observed between the pollination failure rate and the total seed crop in the current year supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The predator satiation hypothesis was also supported by the fact that the predation rate showed a good fit to the ratio of successive total seed crops, suggesting that a numerical response (starving the predator in low seed years) operated in F. crenata.

4
Key-factor analysis revealed that pre-dispersal seed predation had a larger effect on seed production per flower than did pollination efficiency.

5
We used a simulation model to examine how the magnitude of fluctuation in the total seed crop would influence the pollination failure rate, the predation rate and the viable seed rate. The mean levels of fluctuation of total seed crops of F. crenata were just large enough to provide maximum benefits from predator satiation at some sites.

6
Mast seeding in F. crenata thus appears to be determined by selective pressures from its seed predators.

TI  - Effects of climate on reproductive investment in a masting species: Assessment of climatic predictors and underlying mechanisms
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary 1. Mechanisms by which climatic factors drive reproductive investment and phenology in masting species are not completely understood. Climatic conditions may act as a proximate cue, stimulating the onset of reproduction and indirectly increasing fitness through benefits associated with synchronous reproduction among individuals. Alternatively, climatic conditions may directly influence individual-level allocation to reproduction and reproductive success through effects occurring independently of synchronous reproduction. We previously showed that masting in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) population was strongly influenced by spring mean temperature 2 years before seed cone maturation (Ti-2). However, recent work shows that the difference in temperature between previous growing seasons (DT) is more predictive of reproductive investment in long-lived tree species. 2. Here, we compared four candidate models that predict seed cone production in P. ponderosa based upon different climatic factors (including Ti-2 and DT models). After determining the best climatic predictor, we tested for a potential mechanism by which climate might directly influence seed cone production independent of benefits via synchrony, namely effects of temperature on trade-offs between current and past reproduction (determined by underlying resource availability). 3. We found that Ti-2 (rather than DT) was the best predictor of seed cone production. We further show that this same climatic factor exerts a direct fitness benefit to individuals by reducing the strength of trade-offs between current and past reproductive efforts. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that a single climatic factor provides fitness benefits to individuals directly, by weakening reproductive trade-offs, and indirectly through the benefits associated with synchrony and masting. This suggests a mechanism for the origin and maintenance of masting: individuals initially respond to climatic cues that directly enhance reproduction (e.g. lower reproductive costs through weakened trade-offs) and this dynamic, expressed across multiple individuals, reinforces these benefits through the economies of scale associated with synchrony and masting.

TI  - The ecology, evolution and management of mast reproduction in Australian plants
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Australia is home to a diverse assemblage of plant species that display marked population-level variation in inter-annual flower or seed output (i.e. masting). These include a semelparous bamboo with an estimated inter-crop period of 40–50 years, numerous iteroparous masting gymnosperms, angiosperms that include landscape-dominant eucalypts, arid-zone wattles and spinifex (Triodia spp.) grasses, and a rich selection of species that display disturbance-related forms of masting such as pyrogenic flowering and environmental prediction. Despite the prevalence of masting in the Australian flora, there has been a paucity of research on these plants. Nevertheless, from the literature available, it appears that, similar to other parts of the world, a continuum of inter-year reproductive variability exists, with a small number of species displaying extreme–high inter-annual seeding variability. From experimental studies and many anecdotal reports, most of the fitness benefits associated with masting evident overseas also operate in Australia (e.g. predator satiation, improved pollination efficiency, and environmental prediction). Additionally, some Australian masting species offer periodically important food resources for Aboriginal nations in the form of seed or fruit. These include the bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), members of the cycad genera Cycas and Macrozamia, spinifex (Triodia) grasses, and mulga shrubs (Acacia aneura). Key future research areas for effective conservation of Australian masting plants include (1) improved understanding of how management interventions such as burning and silvicultural thinning influence regeneration dynamics and higher-order trophic interactions, (2) further longitudinal monitoring across a range of habitats to identify other, as yet unknown, species that display reproductive intermittency, and (3) elucidation of how changes to temperature, precipitation and fire regimes under climate change will affect reproduction and regeneration dynamics of the Australian masting flora.</jats:p>

TI  - LONG-TERM PATTERNS OF ACORN PRODUCTION FOR FIVE OAK SPECIES IN XERIC FLORIDA UPLANDS
PY  - 2003
AB  - The number of seeds produced by a population of woody plants can vary markedly from year to year. Unfortunately, knowledge of the patterns and causes of crop-size variation is limited, and most studies have examined only single species in a single mesic environment. We examined long-term patterns of acorn crop sizes for five species of shrubby oaks in three xeric upland vegetative associations of south-central peninsular Florida for evidence of regular fruiting cycles and in relation to winter temperature and precipitation. Counts of acorns on two white oak species (Quercus chapmanii and Q. geminata) and three red oak species (Q. inopina, Q. laevis, and Q. myrtifolia) were conducted annually from 1969 to 1996 (except in 1991) on grids in southern ridge sandhill, sand pine scrub, and scrubby flatwoods associations. As the result of the dissimilar timing of reproductive events in species of red and white oaks and individual species responses to climatic variables, annual acorn production of red and white oak species in a given vegetation association were not synchronized, which dampened the variability of combined annual acorn production. Consequently, acorns were produced with reasonable abundance every year by at least one species. Oaks of nearly closed-canopy scrub produced fewer acorns than similar-sized oaks of the same species in the more open-canopied sandhill and scrubby flatwoods, suggesting light limitation. We identified regular cycles of acorn production that ranged from 2 to 2.4 yr for white oak species and from 3.6 to 5.5 yr for red oak species and found evidence that annual acorn production is affected by the interactions of precipitation, which is highly variable seasonally and annually in peninsular Florida, with endogenous reproductive patterns. Multiple regression models using precipitation variables accounted for as much as 74% of crop-size variation in Q. inopina, 65% in Q. laevis, 60% in Q. chapmanii, and 44% in Q. geminata, but only 29% for Q. myrtifolia. In contrast, acorn production showed no significant association with minimum winter temperatures. Of the various hypotheses offered to explain supra-annual variation in seed crops, our data are most compatible with the nonadaptive resource-matching hypothesis.

TI  - Masting in Buxus balearica: assessing fruiting patterns and processes at a large spatial scale
PY  - 2006
AB  - Masting consists of the synchronous highly variable seed production among years by a plant population. We studied spatiotemporal variation in fruit production in ten populations of Buxus balearica (six in the Balearic Islands and four in the Iberian Peninsula) from 2001 to 2004 in the light of masting. In some of them we assessed, by means of both observational and experimental data, the relationship between fruit production and some abiotic variables, the role of previous reproduction, the "pollination efficiency" and the "predator satiation" hypotheses, as well as the consequences for seedling density and survival. Fruit production in B. balearica showed substantial between-year variation, especially in island compared to mainland populations. Correlative evidence indicated that this variation and its geographic pattern were related to differences between regions in rainfall variability, cost of reproduction and the degree of ambophily. We found no indication of predator satiation. However, experimental tests failed to support many of our results, namely a negative effect of previous reproduction on future flowering in island populations and lower pollen limitation with increasing flower production. We therefore warn against exclusive reliance on correlations when testing hypotheses related to masting. In addition, seedling recruitment increased after some episodes of high fruit production but probably additional factors had a role in recruitment, suggesting that mast events not always translate into increased reproductive success. Although a limited time series only allows considering B. balearica as showing 'putative' masting, weather and pollination-related processes are good candidates for further exploration of fruiting patterns and processes at a large spatial scale.

TI  - A simple mechanistic model of seed dispersal, predation and plant establishment: Janzen‐Connell and beyond
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary


1
Although, in nature, seed dispersal usually declines with distance from the source, seedling establishment patterns are highly variable. An increase in seed survival can lead to either hump-shaped (Janzen-Connell (J-C) pattern) or declining (Hubbell pattern) establishment with distance from seed source, but declining establishment can also be generated if survival decreases with distance (McCanny pattern). Pathogens and seed predators are considered to be major mortality agents structuring recruitment patterns, but it is unclear how well predation alone can explain variation in these patterns.

2
We introduce a simple mechanistic model showing that distance and density-dependent seed predation can generate all of the observed recruitment patterns. Our approach provides the first mathematical reconstruction of conceptual models previously considered to be based on contrasting underlying mechanisms. Three easily measurable quantities (the proportion of seeds escaping predation at the source, and the mean distance from the source of dispersed seeds and of predators’ activity) can be used to test for consistency with the J-C pattern. The association between recruitment patterns and plant (dispersal) and animal (predation) characteristics is robust with respect to parameter values and various functional forms.

3
The model shows that the J-C pattern can occur only if the mean distance over which predators are active is lower than that over which seeds are dispersed, corresponding to a system with host-specific, or immobile, seed predators (often invertebrates) that are restricted to areas of high seed density near adult plants, and therefore selecting for longer dispersal distances of seeds.

4
The Hubbell pattern is generated by the model when dispersal and predation distances are of equivalent magnitudes. The McCanny pattern emerges if more generalized, or more mobile, seed predators (often vertebrates) are attracted to the adult trees but also tend to forage farther away, thereby selecting for short dispersal distances that generate high densities needed to satiate seed predators.

5
The model also predicts that the total number of seeds surviving predation is lowest at intermediate distances, suggesting that distance-dependent predation promotes either short or long dispersal distances, or both (dimorphism).

TI  - Of mast and mean: differential-temperature cue makes mast seeding insensitive to climate change
PY  - 2012
AB  - Mast-seeding plants often produce high seed crops the year after a warm spring or summer, but the warm-temperature model has inconsistent predictive ability. Here, we show for 26 long-term data sets from five plant families that the temperature difference between the two previous summers (ΔT) better predicts seed crops. This discovery explains how masting species tailor their flowering patterns to sites across altitudinal temperature gradients; predicts that masting will be unaffected by increasing mean temperatures under climate change; improves prediction of impacts on seed consumers; demonstrates that strongly masting species are hypersensitive to climate; explains the rarity of consecutive high-seed years without invoking resource constraints; and generates hypotheses about physiological mechanisms in plants and insect seed predators. For plants, ΔT has many attributes of an ideal cue. This temperature-difference model clarifies our understanding of mast seeding under environmental change, and could also be applied to other cues, such as rainfall.

TI  - Predation of beech seed by mice: Effects of numerical and functional responses
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary 1. The functional response of post-dispersal seed predators (house mouse, Mus musculus ) to absolute densities of southern beech seed ( Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides ) was studied in laboratory and field trials. House mice showed a Type II (hyperbolic) functional response to seed availability and this was not modified by the presence of an alternative food source. 2. Maximum daily intake rate of beech seeds during field trials averaged 1042 seeds mouse − 1 . This is sufficient to provide house mice with both the energy and protein required for growth and reproduction. 3. We explicitly incorporated the functional response into the numerical response of house mice to beech seed, measured for field populations monitored in a New Zealand beech forest. House mice showed a strong numerical response to beech seed intake rate that was modified by some density-dependent mechanism(s). 4. We developed a model that simulated seedfall, house mouse population growth and seed reserve depletion over one year. We found that the previously reported decline in house-mouse populations in beech forests during spring and summer is likely to be related to spring beech seed germination that renders seed no longer available as a food source for house mice. 5. From our simulation model it does not appear that house-mouse populations can completely eat-out beech seed reserves prior to germination in a year of large seedfall. ‘Masting’ behaviour in New Zealand native beech trees is therefore sufficient to satiate an eruptive population of an exotic mammalian omnivore, despite the lack of a long co-evolutionary interaction.

TI  - Annual Variability in Seed Production by Woody Plants and the Masting Concept: Reassessment of Principles and Relationship to Pollination and Seed Dispersal
PY  - 1998
AB  - By analyzing 296 published and unpublished data sets describing annual variation in seed output by 144 species of woody plants, this article addresses the following questions. Do plant species naturally fall into distinct groups corresponding to masting and nonmasting habits? Do plant populations generally exhibit significant bimodality in annual seed output? Are there significant relationships between annual variability in seed production and pollination and seed dispersal modes, as predicted from economy of scale considerations? We failed to identify distinct groups of species with contrasting levels of annual variability in seed output but did find evidence that most polycarpic woody plants seem to adhere to alternating supra-annual schedules consisting of either high or low reproduction years. Seed production was weakly more variable among wind-pollinated taxa than animal-pollinated ones. Plants dispersed by mutualistic frugivores were less variable than those dispersed by either inanimate means or animals that predominantly behave as seed predators. We conclude that there are no objective reasons to perpetuate the concept of mast fruiting in the ecological literature as a shorthand to designate a distinct biological phenomenon. Associations between supra-annual variability in seed output and pollination and seed dispersal methods suggest the existence of important reproductive correlates that demand further investigation.

TI  - Efficiency of pollination and satiation of predators determine reproductive output in Iberian Juniperus thurifera woodlands.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Fruit production in animal-dispersed plants has a strong influence on fitness because large crops increase the number of seeds dispersed by frugivores. Large crops are costly, and environmental control of plant resources is likely play a role in shaping temporal and spatial variations in seed production, particularly in fluctuating environments such as the Mediterranean. The number of fruits that start to develop and the proportion of viable seeds produced are also linked to the number of flowers formed and the efficiency of pollination in wind-pollinated plants. Finally, large fruit displays also attract seed predators, having a negative effect on seed output. We assessed the relative impact of environmental conditions on fruit production, and their combined effect on seed production, abortion and seed loss through three predispersal predators in Juniperus thurifera L., sampling 14 populations across the Iberian Peninsula. Wetter than average conditions during flowering and early fruit development led to larger crop sizes; this effect was amplified at tree level, with the most productive trees during more favourable years yielding fruits with more viable seeds and less empty and aborted seeds. In addition, large crops satiated the less mobile seed predator. The other two predispersal predators responded to plant traits, the presence of other seed predators and environmental conditions, but did not show a satiation response to the current-year crop. Our large-scale study on a dioecious, wind-pollinated Mediterranean juniper indicates that pollination efficiency and satiation of seed predators, mediated by environmental conditions, are important determinants of reproductive output in this juniper species.

TI  - Pre- and post-dispersal seed predation in Tachigali versicolor (Caesalpiniaceae): effects of timing of fruiting and variation among trees
PY  - 1999
AB  - Fruiting phenology, habitat types and proximity to conspecific fruiting adults may influence the degree of escape from pre- and post-dispersal seed predators. Successful predator escape by means of satiation is considered to be especially important for selection of masting and monocarpic reproduction in trees, such as exhibited by Tachigali versicolor, a tropical canopy tree. How pre- and post-dispersal predation rates varied with dispersal timing and among trees in T. versicolor was examined in young and old forests on Barro Colorado Island in Panama during a 4-mo period. Seeds were collected from above-ground traps to assess predispersal predation by bruchid beetles, and from quadrats on the ground to record predation and removal by terrestrial mammals. Proportion of seeds aborted varied greatly among trees (range 6-30 %, mean 16 %), and was especially high for trees on the edge of the island with fruiting conspecifics nearby during the early part of fruiting season. The proportion of seeds killed by bruchid beetles varied less among trees (14-25 %, mean 20 %), and remained constant throughout the fruiting season. Seeds on the ground were attacked mostly by rodents, and possibly by deer (26 % of all seeds and 43 % of intact dispersed seeds). The post- dispersal predation level was higher in the young forest than in the old forest (61 and 26 % of intact dispersed seeds, respectively), and was unaffected by the prox- imity of fruiting conspecifics. Temporal satiation of seed predators was evident only for post-dispersal mammalian predators in the old forest.

TI  - Evidence that predator satiation drives reproductive synchrony in the desert masting grass, soft spinifex (Triodia pungens)
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The predator satiation (PS) hypothesis of masting holds that seeding periodicity among plant populations enhances seed survival by starving granivores during low‐output periods and satiating reduced consumer populations during mast (high‐output) years. Although well‐studied in the northern hemisphere and in New Zealand, the PS hypothesis has received scant research attention in Australia. This is despite vegetation communities across nearly half the continent being dominated by masting species subject to high levels of seed predation (e.g. mulga [<jats:italic>Acacia aneura</jats:italic>] shrublands and spinifex [<jats:italic>Triodia</jats:italic> spp.] grasslands). Here, phenological monitoring and experimental testing of the PS hypothesis in the desert masting grass <jats:italic>Triodia pungens</jats:italic> (soft spinifex) occurred over 10 years at Deep Well station, central Australia. Field evidence supported the hypothesis that masting enhances seed escape from predators, as mean proportion seed survival at experimental bait stations was significantly greater during mast years (0.38 in 2012 and 0.33 in 2017) than during inter‐mast years (0.01 in 2016 and 2018). The possibility that seed decay as opposed to consumption affected results was controlled for by a deterioration experiment that indicated no significant loss of seed viability after 6‐months burial. The results support the hypothesis that masting in <jats:italic>T. pungens</jats:italic> is an adaptive trait related to the satiation of seed predators. However, whether masting enhances seed escape because predators are satiated at higher seed densities (i.e. masting causes a predator functional response) and/or because frequent low‐output periods reduce predator populations and make satiation more likely (i.e. a numerical predator masting response), remains unresolved. Aside from <jats:italic>T. pungens</jats:italic>, there are numerous other plants of the Australian arid zone that experience high levels of granivory and display masting. Seed predation may be a more important selective force acting on arid Australian plant reproduction than previously thought.</jats:p>

TI  - Resource depletion, pollen coupling, and the ecology of mast seeding.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Masting, the highly variable and synchronous production of seeds across a population of perennial plants, is an ecologically important, but still poorly understood, phenomenon. While much is known about the fitness benefits of masting and its effects on seed consumers and trophic interactions, less is understood about the proximate mechanisms of masting. The resource budget model (RBM) posits that masting requires more resources than plants can gain in a single year. Individual plants store resources until a threshold is reached and then produce seeds, which depletes resources so that plants cannot reproduce again for 2 or more years. Individuals are synchronized by pollen coupling or environmental forcing. We review the assumptions of these models and assess the extent to which they are consistent with general patterns in plant populations. We discuss the implications of the RBM for how plants respond to changes in the external environment. Overall, the RBM is a likely cause of synchrony in many, but not all, masting species. This mechanistic hypothesis also leads to specific, but not always intuitive, expectations about how plant resources affect mast seeding.

TI  - Seed predation of Araucaria angustifolia (Araucariaceae) by small rodents in two areas with contrasting seed densities in the Brazilian Araucaria forest
PY  - 2011
AB  - We investigated the effects of variation in seed density on small-rodent predation of Araucaria angustifolia seeds. Seed removal experiments were conducted simultaneously in two contrasting stands (seed-poor – planted with the slash pine Pinus elliottii and seed-rich – planted with A. angustifolia) outside the seed production period and also during the seed production period. Predator abundance (evaluated through live-trapping) did not vary significantly between stands. Tracking of thread-marked seeds indicated that rodents frequently move seeds away from the source point and that seed-carrying distance (range 3.91–8.30 m) is not significantly related to area or season. Seed removal rates were high in both areas outside the seed production period but during seed-producing months they were significantly lower in the seed-rich area, supporting the predator-satiation hypothesis. The A. angustifolia strategy of synchronous production of large seed crops but with high between-year variation is potentially succ...

TI  - VERTEBRATE RESPONSES TO SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN SEED PRODUCTION OF MAST-FRUITING DIPTEROCARPACEAE
PY  - 2000
AB  - To examine the interspecific reproductive synchrony of Dipterocarpaceae with vertebrate responses to seed availablity, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution and phenology of more than 2367 adult dipterocarp individuals of 54 species from March 1985 to January 1993 in the Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seven vegetational formations were sampled along an altitudinal gradient from peat swamp forest (5 m a.s.l. (above sea level)) across lowlands to upper montane zones (1100 m a.s.l.) that encompassed two upland valley complexes in a 15-km 2 area. Four significant reproductive events were documented: (1) a common lowland species reproduced outside of mast events in 1986 and in 1990; (2) a localized lowland ''minor'' mast event in 1986 in which 24.3% of the adult trees (21 spp.) participated; (3) a major community-wide mast event (92.8%, 48 spp.) in 1987, just 6 mo after the minor event; and (4) another major community-wide mast fruiting event after a 4-yr intermast interval (88%, 48 spp.) in 1991. West Kalimantan export records of illipe nut (Dipterocarpaceae: Shorea section Pachycarpae) from 1968 to 1997 were compiled as a baseline measure of the frequency and relative intensity of dipterocarp mast-fruiting events in the region ( CV 5 152%). A ''bumper crop'' occurred about every 5 6 2.6 yr (mean 6 1 SD; range 3-9 yr). Fruit production was significantly associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The 1987 and 1991 mast events monitored were the third and fourth largest export years in the province since 1968. Because of the disputed role of vertebrate seed predators in causing and maintaining mast-fruiting behavior, the response of seed-eating vertebrates to this spatiotemporal variation in dipterocarp seed production was examined. Seed of a common, but asynchronous, lowland species was largely consumed by vertebrates. In the 1986 minor mast, 21 dipterocarp species that produced 60 000 seeds/ha (dry mass 46 kg/ha) lost all monitored viable seed to a diversity of resident and nomadic vertebrate seed predators. Timed with dipterocarp seed production in all mast events, nomadic vertebrates increased their pop- ulations through both reproduction and regional movement (numerical response). However, in both the 1987 and 1991 mast events, resident vertebrates destroyed only 1.5% and 2.6% of community seed production, and predation was recorded only in the tails of the fruit-fall distribution. During these community mast events, resident vertebrates switched from dipterocarp seed to feed on fruit and seed from other available species. Nomadic vertebrates arrived late in the fruit-fall period during both major mast events and, thus, were able to destroy only seed dispersed in the final 1-3 wk of fruit-fall. Seed escape, and thus regeneration, only occurred in major mast events when all dipterocarp species across large areas participated. Considerable seedling recruitment was recorded in both the 1987 ( ;95 000 seedlings/ha) and 1991 (155 824 6 36 764 seedlings/ha) mast events. Results from this natural experiment indicate that resident and nomadic vertebrates cause stabilizing selection for tight interspecific synchrony of dipterocarp seedfall over vast regions. Although the pattern generally conformed to the predator-satiation hypothesis, the observed mechanisms for seed escape within a mast-fruiting event did not. Resident and nomadic vertebrate foraging and ranging patterns resulted in dipterocarp seed ''escape'' rather than local ''swamping'' with copious seed production per se. To account for these observations, two hypotheses, ''interfamilial satiation'' and ''regional escape,'' were developed. The period of seed availability and length of the regional intermast interval is examined with seed-predator reproduction and behavior to assess the impact of seed availability on seed-predator populations.

TI  - Masting and trophic cascades: interplay between rowan trees, apple fruit moth, and their parasitoid in southern Norway
PY  - 2004
AB  - We analyzed berry production in rowan, Sorbus aucuparia L., in southern Norway and examined the ramifying effects of rowan masting on the dynamics of the dominant seed predator and its parasitoid. The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella Zeller, is a pre-dispersal seed predator of rowan. The larva of the apple fruit moth rely on rowan berries, which in turn is attacked by the parasitoid wasp, Microgaster politus Marsh. We found classic masting in rowan: berry production varied across years (the mean coefficient of variation=1.02) and was spatially synchronized at large scale (the averaged correlation coefficient = 0.67). Berry production represented a two-year cycle in western but a three-year cycle in eastern Norway. The abundance of the moth and the parasitoid also varied across years and were spatially synchronized. The degree of spatial synchrony decreased and cyclicity became obscure with increasing trophic level. We attempted to assess two different components to the predator satiation, functional and numerical satiations, based on a simple population dynamics model. The observed pattern of seed predation testified that both of functional and numerical satiations were at work in this system. In a comparison at different locations, rowan trees with more variable berry production were more effective in reducing losses to the seed predator. The parasitoids also seemed to experience satiation through the fluctuation in their host abundance. These results show that rowan masting has an adaptive foundation, which impacts the dynamics of higher trophic levels.

TI  - How to measure mast seeding?
PY  - 2023
AB  - The periodic production of large seed crops, or masting, is a widespread phenomenon in perennial plants. This behavior can enhance the reproductive efficiency of plants, leading to increased fitness, and produce ripple effects on food webs. While variability from year to year is a defining characteristic of masting, the methods used to quantify this variability are highly debated. The commonly used coefficient of variation lacks the ability to account for the serial dependence in mast data and can be influenced by zeros, making it a less suitable choice for various applications based on individual-level observations, such as phenotypic selection, heritability, and climate change studies, which rely on individual-plant-level datasets that often contain numerous zeros. To address these limitations, we present three case studies and introduce volatility and periodicity, which account for the variance in the frequency domain by emphasizing the significance of long intervals in masting. By utilizing examples of Sorbus aucuparia, Pinus pinea, Quercus robur, Quercus pubescens, and Fagus sylvatica, we demonstrate how volatility captures the effects of variance at both high and low frequencies, even in the presence of zeros, leading to improved ecological interpretations of the results. The growing availability of long-term, individual-plant datasets promises significant advancements in the field, but requires appropriate tools for analysis, which the new metrics provide.

TI  - Why Is Seed Production So Variable among Individuals? A Ten-Year Study with Oaks Reveals the Importance of Soil Environment
PY  - 2014
AB  - Mast-seeding species exhibit not only a large inter-annual variability in seed production but also considerable variability among individuals within the same year. However, very little is known about the causes and consequences for population dynamics of this potentially large between-individual variability. Here, we quantified seed production over ten consecutive years in two Mediterranean oak species – the deciduous Quercus canariensis and the evergreen Q. suber - that coexist in forests of southern Spain. First, we calibrated likelihood models to identify which abiotic and biotic variables best explain the magnitude (hereafter seed productivity) and temporal variation of seed production at the individual level (hereafter CVi), and infer whether reproductive effort results from the available soil resources for the plant or is primarily determined by selectively favoured strategies. Second, we explored the contribution of between-individual variability in seed production as a potential mechanism of satiation for predispersal seed predators. We found that Q. canariensis trees inhabiting moister and more fertile soils were more productive than those growing in more resource-limited sites. Regarding temporal variation, individuals of the two studied oak species inhabiting these resource-rich environments also exhibited larger values of CVi. Interestingly, we detected a satiating effect on granivorous insects at the tree level in Q. suber, which was evident in those years where between-individual variability in acorn production was higher. These findings suggest that individual seed production (both in terms of seed productivity and inter-annual variability) is strongly dependent on soil resource heterogeneity (at least for one of the two studied oak species) with potential repercussions for recruitment and population dynamics. However, other external factors (such as soil heterogeneity in pathogen abundance) or certain inherent characteristics of the tree might be also involved in this process.

TI  - Snow Tussocks, Chaos, and the Evolution of Mast Seeding
PY  - 2002
AB  - One hitherto intractable problem in studying mast seed- ing (synchronous intermittent heavy flowering by a population of perennial plants) is determining the relative roles of weather, plant reserves, and evolutionary selective pressures such as predator sati- ation. We parameterize a mechanistic resource-based model for mast seeding in Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae) using a long-term individ- ually structured data set. Each plant's energy reserves were recon- structed using annual inputs (growing degree days), outputs (flow- ering), and a novel regression technique. This allowed the estimation of the parameters that control internal plant resource dynamics, and thereby allowed different models for masting to be tested against each other. Models based only on plant size, season degree days, and/ or climatic cues (warm January temperatures) fail to reproduce the pattern of autocovariation in individual flowering and the high levels of flowering synchrony seen in the field. This shows that resource- matching or simple cue-based models cannot account for this ex- ample of mast seeding. In contrast, the resource-based model pulsed by a simple climate cue accurately describes both individual-level and population-level aspects of the data. The fitted resource-based model, in the absence of environmental forcing, has chaotic (but often statistically periodic) dynamics. Environmental forcing syn- chronizes individual reproduction, and the models predict highly variable seed production in close agreement with the data. An evo- lutionary model shows that the chaotic internal resource dynamics, as predicted by the fitted model, is selectively advantageous provided that adult mortality is low and seeds survive for more than 1 yr, both of which are true for C. pallens. Highly variable masting and chaotic dynamics appear to be advantageous in this case because they reduce seed losses to specialist seed predators, while balancing the costs of missed reproductive events.

TI  - Nonviable seed set enhances plant fitness: the sacrificial sibling hypothesis
PY  - 2009
AB  - Many tree species produce far more fruits than eventually mature, with a large proportion of developing fruits being aborted midway through the development process. Whether this is a maternally controlled late-acting self-incompatibility mechanism, or an expression of inbreeding depression, is difficult to determine. In either case, however, selection is expected to favor early abortion of inbred or incompatible zygotes to minimize loss of resources. In many species, this does not occur, suggesting the possibility of adaptive reasons for retaining selfed or inbred seeds that are aborted at relatively late developmental stages. We propose that such seeds serve an important function in diluting the impact of pre-dispersal seed predators by acting as seed predator sinks and thereby increasing the survival probabilities of outcrossed and fully viable seeds. We suggest that selfed seeds retained and developed through the periods of seed predator attack are effectively offered and sacrificed for the benefit of outcrossed seeds.

TI  - Seed fate and seedling dynamics after masting in two African rain forest trees
PY  - 2011
AB  - How the effects of biotic factors are moderated by abiotic factors, and their consequences for species interactions, is generally understudied in ecology. A key abiotic feature of forests is regular canopy disturbances that create temporary patches, or “gaps,” of above-average light availability. Co-occurring in lowland primary forest of Korup National Park (Cameroon), Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberlinia bifoliolata are locally dominant, ectomycorrhizal trees whose seeds share predator guilds in masting years. Here, we experimentally tested the impact of small mammal predators upon seedling abundance, growth, and survivorship. In 2007, we added a fixed density of seeds of each species to exclosures at 48 gap–understory locations across 82.5 ha within a large Microberlinia grove, and at 15 locations outside it.

For both species, small mammals removed more seeds in gaps than in understory, whereas this was reversed for seeds killed by invertebrates. Nonetheless, Microberlinia lost twice as many seeds to small mammals, and more to invertebrates in exclosures, than Tetraberlinia, which was more prone to a pathogenic white fungus. After six weeks, both species had greater seedling establishment in gaps than understory, and in exclosures outside compared to exclosures inside the grove. In the subsequent two-year period, seedling growth and survivorship peaked in exclosures in gaps, but Microberlinia had more seedlings' stems clipped by animals than Tetraberlinia, and more than twice the percentage of leaf area damaged. Whereas Microberlinia seedling performance in gaps was inferior to Tetraberlinia inside the grove, outside it Microberlinia had reduced leaf damage, grew taller, and had many more leaves than Tetraberlinia.

No evidence was found for “apparent mutualism” in the understory as seedling establishment of both species increased away from (>25 m) large stems of either species, pointing to “apparent competition” instead. In gaps, Microberlinia seedling establishment was lower near Tetraberlinia than conspecific adults because of context-dependent small mammal satiation. Stage-matrix analysis suggested that protecting Microberlinia from small mammals could increase its population growth rate by 0.06. In the light of prior research we conclude that small mammals and canopy gaps play an important role in promoting species coexistence in this forest, and that their strong interaction contributes to Microberlinia's currently very poor regeneration.

TI  - MAST SEEDING IN PERENNIAL PLANTS: Why, How, Where?
PY  - 2002
AB  - ▪ Abstract For many years biologists have debated whether mast seeding (the synchronous intermittent production of large seed crops in perennial plants) results from weather conditions or is an evolved plant reproductive strategy. In this review, we analyze the evidence for the underlying causes of masting. In the absence of selection for higher or lower variability, plants will vary in tandem with the environment (resource matching). Two selective factors often favor the evolution of masting: increased pollination efficiency in wind-pollinated species, and satiation of seed predators. Other factors select against masting, including animal pollination and frugivore dispersal. A survey of 570 masting datasets shows that wind-pollinated species had higher seed production coefficients of variation (CVs) than biotically pollinated ones. Frugivore-dispersed species had low CVs whereas predator-dispersed plants had high CVs, consistent with gaining benefits from predator satiation rather than dispersal. The glo...

TI  - The relevance of burial to evade acorn predation in an oak forest affected by habitat loss and land use changes
PY  - 2014
AB  - Seed burial has been proposed as an effective mechanism to evade predation in continuous forests. However, its rele- vance may be compromised in fragmented forests because: (1) predators are usually concentrated within forests patches, which elevates consumer pressure on seeds; and (2) fragmentation reduces seed production in remnant trees, decreasing food availability for seed consumers. Thus, predators might be forced to consume buried seeds after seeds on the soil surface are depleted. Indeed, they may explore the surrounding matrix in search of food when seeds within patches become scarce. This study assesses these issues in a fragmented oak forest where human activities have generated four habitat types: forest patches, patch edges, matrix ha- bitat surrounding patches, and an abandoned agricultural fi eld in the neighborhoods of the fragmented forest. In this landscape, we assessed what animals consume acorn and compared removal rates between buried acorns and acorns exposed on the soil surface across these habitat types. Mice of the genus Peromyscus and birds of the genus Aphelocoma were the main responsible of remo- ving acorns in all habitats types, but mice were only recorded during night and birds were only recorded during day. Buried acorns were less removed (12-35%) than exposed ones (42-68%) in the matrix habitat and the abandoned fi eld. Nevertheless, within forest patches and their edges, buried (78-81%) and exposed acorns (91%) showed no differences in removal rates. These results suggest that burial may be an effective mechanism to evade acorn predation in habitats strongly affected by human activities, while

TI  - Forest fragmentation and selective logging affect the seed survival and recruitment of a relictual conifer
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Defaunation, invasive species and forest fragmentation are considered to be the major drivers for the disruption of key ecological processes, particularly those related to plant animal-interactions such as seed dispersal and predation. The disruption of critical phases in the plant life cycle may ultimately have negative impacts on plant recruitment and the survival of plant populations. Here, for the first time we compared the seed removal and recruitment of Araucaria angustifolia, a critically endangered and relictual gymnosperm species, in multiple sites, including continuous and fragmented forest areas in the Brazilian Atlantic subtropical forest. Our sampling included seed removal experiment monitored by camera traps and surveys of A. angustifolia recruitment. We found that seed survival and recruitment were related to the density of adult A. angustifolia. Therefore the formation of large and dense groves, which is a characteristic of pristine Araucaria moist forests endangered by forest fragmentation and selective logging, may be an attempt to satiate seed predator communities. Additionally, forest fragmentation and the introduction of wild boar decreased seed survival to very low, and forest fragmentation decreased recruitment by fourfold on average. Increase protection and recuperation of Araucaria moist forests and the eradication of the invasive wild boar where possible are necessary measures for increasing seed survival rates and the recruitment of this relictual conifer.

TI  - Predator satiation and extreme mast seeding in 11 species of Chionochloa (Poaceae)
PY  - 2000
AB  - Variation in annual flowering effort is described for 16 long datasets from 11 species of Chionochloa (Poaceae) in New Zealand. All populations exhibited extreme mast seeding. The most variable species was C. crassiuscula (coefficient of variation, CV = 3.02) over 26 years at Takahe Valley, Fiordland, which is the highest published CV we know of worldwide. The other populations also had high CVs (lowest CV = 1.42, mean CV = 1.84) which were higher than for other well-studied genera such as Picea, Pinus and Quercus. There were also frequent years of zero flowering (mean across all populations was 37.2% zero years; maximum 53% for C. rubra and C. crassiuscula over 19 years) whereas zero years are rare in other published masting datasets. Flowering was highly synchronous among species within a site (mean r = 0.886), and also (though significantly less so) among sites. Among sites, synchrony was not significantly higher within-species (mean r = 0.711) than between-species (r = 0.690). Warm summer temperatures led to heavy flowering the following summer. Flowering synchrony increased with increasing synchrony in local deseasonalised summer temperatures, and decreased with increasing distance between sites. Mast seeding has been shown in Chionochloa to reduce losses to specialist flower or seed predators. Among-species synchrony may be adaptive if species share a common seed predator. Developing seeds of at least 10 Chionochloa species are attacked by larvae of an undescribed cecidomyiid. In Takahe Valley, where masting is most pronounced, cecidomyiids attacked all six Chionochloa species in all four years studied. Mean annual losses were almost constant (10.0 to 13.4%) while flowering effort varied 100-fold. The invariant losses are consistent with other evidence that the cecidomyiid may have extended diapause, which would make it harder to satiate by mast seeding. We hypothesise that one possible factor favouring such extremely high levels of mast seeding in Chionochloa is that its seed predator is very hard to satiate.

TI  - Seed survival on experimental dishes in a central European old‐growth mixed‐species forest – effects of predator guilds, tree masting and small mammal population dynamics
PY  - 2011
AB  - Predation of tree seeds can be a major factor structuring plant communities. We present a three year study on tree seed survival on experimental dishes in an old-growth forest in central Europe in Austria. We addressed species specific, spatial and temporal aspects of post-dispersal seed predation. Seeds of Norway spruce Picea abies, European beech Fagus sylvatica, and silver fir Abies alba were exposed on dishes in different types of exclosures which allowed access only to specific guilds of seed predators. Removal experiments were carried out in two old-growth forests and a managed forest (macro-sites), including micro-sites with and without cover of ground vegetation. We conducted the experiment in three consecutive years with a mast year of beech and spruce before the first year of the study. The seed removal experiments were combined with live trapping of small mammals being potential seed predators. Our experiments showed a distinctly different impact of different predator guilds on seed survival on the dishes with highest removal rates of seeds from dishes accessible for small mammals. We observed differing preferences of small mammals for the different tree species. Seed survival in different macro- and micro-habitats were highly variable with lower seed survival in old growth forests. In contrast to our assumption, and in contrast to the satiation hypothesis which assumes higher seed survival in and directly after mast years, seed survival was lower in the year following the mast year of beech when a population peak of small mammals occurred and higher in intermast periods when subsequently small mammal population crashed. This suggests a higher importance of sporadic masting shortly after mast years in intermast periods for establishment of forest trees provided that pollination efficiency is high enough in such years. Combined with the high seed mortality observed after the mast year, this corroborates the important role of seed predation for forest dynamics. An altered synchrony or asynchrony of masting of different tree species and changed masting frequencies through climate change may thus lead to strong and non-linear effects on forest dynamics.

TI  - Quantifying the benefits of mast seeding on predator satiation and wind pollination in Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae)
PY  - 1997
AB  - Mast seeding could be favoured by a number of factors, including predator satiation and wind pollination. When both these factors could be involved, determining which is more important has been very difficult. In this paper we present 10 years of data on flowering intensity, seed predation and estimated pollination success for Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae), an alpine tussock grass, at Mt Hutt, South Island, New Zealand. C. pallens suffers from high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation (up to 94%) and is wind pollinated, so provides an ideal experimental system. C. pallens had very variable flowering intensity between years (coefficient of variation of floret production (CV)= 1.80). A significant predator satiation effect was found. Predation was not affected by the absolute level of flowering intensity in the current year, but did vary significantly with the change in flowering intensity between the current and previous years. Therefore, predator satiation seemed to involve a numerical response (starving the predator in low seed years). There was a significant wind pollination benefit from larger flowering efforts, which depended only on the size of the current flowering effort. Therefore, for benefits via pollination, C. pallens populations with high levels of resources can satisfactorily produce a large flowering effort every year; in contrast, to gain benefits via predator satiation, fluctuating flowering intensity is required regardless of mean levels. The relative benefits of masting versus constant reproduction were modelled; benefits from wind pollination increased very little with increased CVs, to give a benefit of 2.3% fewer florets with unexpanded ovaries at the field CV of 1.8 than at CV = 0. The overall mean flowering effort is apparently high enough in the study population for efficient pollination even if masting did not occur. Predator satiation gave large benefits from masting, from 8% of all florets at Cv = 1.25 increasing rapidly to 42% at CV = 1.8 and 62% at CV = 2.25. Therefore predator satiation is vastly more important than wind pollination in favouring mast seeding in C. pallens, providing 92-95% of the benefits at CVs>1.5. The rapid increase in benefits from predator satiation at CV > 1.5 may help explain why Chionochloa species have such high CVs.

TI  - ON THE ADAPTIVE VALUE OF REPRODUCTIVE SYNCHRONY AS A PREDATOR-SWAMPING STRATEGY
PY  - 1990
AB  - The logic behind the hypothesis explaining reproductive synchrony as a strategy for reducing the predation of vulnerable offspring (predator swamping) is evaluated by means of two simple models. Predator swamping was found to be an adequate explanation for the occurrence of within-season reproductive synchrony when the predator exhibits a Holling type-II functional response (specialist predator). However, in the case of a generalist predator switching from alternative prey (Holling type-III functional response), which is expected to be a common functional-response type when particular prey are unavailable at certain times of the year, highly asynchronous reproduction may be the best reproductive strategy. In particular, when prey switching occurs at high offspring densities and/or the satiation density of the predator is high relative to the total reproduction of the prey population, the peak predation rate is expected to occur when reproduction is completely synchronous. Spatially clumped prey population...

TI  - Effectiveness of predator satiation in masting oaks is negatively affected by conspecific density
PY  - 2018
AB  - Variation in seed availability shapes plant communities, and is strongly affected by seed predation. In some plant species, temporal variation in seed production is especially high and synchronized over large areas, which is called ‘mast seeding’. One selective advantage of this phenomenon is predator satiation which posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, and satiation in mast years. However, even though seed predation can be predicted to have a strong spatial component and depend on plant densities, whether the effectiveness of predator satiation in masting plants changes according to the Janzen-Connell effect has been barely investigated. We studied, over an 8-year period, the seed production, the spatiotemporal patters of weevil seed predation, and the abundance of adult weevils in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) population that consists of trees interspersed at patches covering a continuum of conspecific density. Isolated oaks effectively satiate predators, but this is trumped by increasing conspecific plant density. Lack of predator satiation in trees growing in dense patches was caused by re-distribution of insects among plants that likely attenuated them against food shortage in lean years, and changed the type of weevil functional response from type II in isolated trees to type III in trees growing in dense patches. This study provides the first empirical evaluation of the notion that masting and predator satiation should be more important in populations that start to dominate their communities, and is consistent with the observation that masting is less frequent and less intense in diverse forests.

TI  - Proximate causes and possible adaptive functions of mast seeding and barren flower shows in spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) in arid regions of Australia
PY  - 2014
AB  - Mast seeding, the intermittent production of large synchronised seed crops among plant populations, is a phenomenon that occurs at exceptionally long intervals in spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) from arid regions of Australia. This is despite the reliance of these fire-sensitive plants on seeds for post-fire regeneration, and that spinifex grasslands rate among Australia’s most flammable ecosystems. The proximate causes and possible adaptive functions of masting in seven species of spinifex from arid regions within the 350-mm rainfall isohyet were investigated. Specifically, the seed set percentages of 79 specimens collected between 1947 and 2012 were related to the following environmental covariates: antecedent rainfall over 6, 12 and 36 months, relative humidity, and the number of days above 40°C and below 0°C during anthesis. Given the potential importance of seeding events for post-fire regeneration, it was also investigated whether masting in Triodia could represent a fire-related form of environmentally predictive masting, by testing whether high-yield years corresponded to years of increased fire occurrence. Examination of the dataset showed that 43% of specimens contained completely aborted inflorescences (0% seed fill), while seed set ranged from 2 to 69% in the remaining specimens. High levels of insect activity were also found, with 42% of specimens showing evidence of insect occupation. Statistical analyses showed that the main environmental driver of seed set was high precipitation over the previous 12 months, and that high-yield years were strongly related to years of increased fire likelihood. The number of days over 40°C was a weakly significant driver of yield, while the remaining covariates were not significant. It is hypothesised that intermittent reproduction by Triodia is a fire-related form of environmentally predictive masting, which maximises chances of post-fire regeneration by satiating seed predators during flammable periods (i.e. after heavy rain years). Furthermore, it is suggested that non-viable flower crops after initial low rainfalls may have an adaptive function, by diluting pre-dispersal seed predator densities with ‘decoy’ ovules that do not mature and lead to the starvation of developing larvae.

TI  - Experimental Studies of Seedling Recruitment from Contrasting Seed Distributions
PY  - 1992
AB  - To examine how selection may act on seed dispersal, we experimentally manipulated seed distributions and compared levels and patterns of seedling recruitment in three altered distributions, relative to the nonmanipulated, leptokurtic distribution. We picked up, then redistributed the wind-dispersed seeds of two isolated parents of Tachigalia versicolor, a tropical tree species growing on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Three experimental distributions were created in long columns adjacent to or well beyond the undisturbed column of the natural distribution: (1) a nonleptokurtic "even" distribution of uniform density equal to the mean density throughout the natural column, (2) a "mixed" distribution with the same total number and kurtosis as the natural column, but composed of an equal proportion of seeds from the two parent trees, and (3) an "extended-tail" distribution spread in low uniform density up to 1.8 km beyond the natural distribution. Thus, the study addressed the relative importance of density, distance, and genetic makeup on offspring recruitment. The results of the 2 yr observations of seed and seedling survival indicate that, relative to the natural distribution, seedling recruitment at 2 yr was greater in the even distribution, was minimally affected by a mixture of genotypes from overlapping distributions of two parent trees, and was very infrequent from seeds dispersed to a wide variety of distant sites. Although the mixture of genotypes from overlapping distributions did enhance the probability of survival at one site, that effect occurred only during the seedling and not the seed stage. For the extended-tail and mixed distributions, in which offspring of both parents occurred at both sites, the impact of site differences (survival in Site A tail > Site B tail; survival in Site A mixed > Site B mixed) exceeded that of parent differences (Parent A > Parent B). The major differences among distributions arose in the seed and early seedling stages (<2 mo), and were due to heavy mortality primarily from seed predators (postdispersal by terrestrial mammals) and mammalian herbivores eating young seedlings. Mammalian predation and herbivory were particularly heavy in the extended-tail distributions. It ap- peared that either predator satiation and/or incomplete searching occurred in the three, much more dense distributions adjacent to the parent trees. In contrast, density-dependent mortality at the spatial scale of -iM2 experimental quadrats was limited to very high densities and occurred only in early seedling stages (0-2 mo). Distance effects on the probability of survival were inconsistent both between sites and among distributions. However, the absolute number of seedlings surviving at 2 yr declined with distance from the parent in all three distributions, except the even distribution at Tree A. Additionally, seedling recruitment at any distance < 100 m from the parent for all three distributions greatly exceeded recruitment at extended-tail (100-1800 m) sites. In summary, offspring recruitment was enhanced by the high cohort density at a large spatial scale (i.e., within a circle of 100 m radius) because of predator satiation. At the same time, it was enhanced slightly by the evenness of the distribution within this scale because of density-dependent mortality at a smaller spatial scale (i.e., 1 M2). Therefore, we conclude that selection on dispersal by Tachigalia versicolor on BCI should act to increase the uniformity of the seed distribution, but not to increase dispersal distance to the point that the density of the seed shadow is diluted.

TI  - Fluctuation in seed abundance has contrasting effects on the fate of seeds from two rapidly germinating tree species in an Asian tropical forest.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The seed predator satiation hypothesis states that high seed abundance can satiate seed predators or seed dispersers, thus promoting seed survival. However, for rapidly germinating seeds in tropical forests, high seed abundance may limit dispersal as the seeds usually remain under parent trees for long periods, which may lead to high mortality due to rodent predation or fungal infestations. By tracking 2 species of rapidly germinating seeds (Pittosporopsis kerrii, family Icacinaceae; Camellia kissi, family Theaceae), which depend on dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents, we investigated the effects of seed abundance at the community level on predation and seed dispersal in the tropical forest of Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Southwest China. We found that high seed abundance at the community level was associated with delayed and reduced seed removal, decreased dispersal distance and increased pre-dispersal seed survival for both plant species. High seed abundance was also associated with reduced seed caching of C. kissi, but it showed little effect on seed caching of P. kerrii. However, post-dispersal seed survival for the 2 plant species followed the reverse pattern. High seed abundance in the community was associated with higher post-dispersal survival of P. kerrii seeds, but with lower post-dispersal survival of C. kissi seeds. Our results suggest that different plant species derive benefit from fluctuations in seed production in different ways.

TI  - Variation in predispersal seed predation in several Australian Acacia spp
PY  - 1986
AB  - Predispersal seed predation was examined in seven Acacia spp. over both time and space. Each species was associated with a particular major seed predator. Two species, A. elongata and A. myrtifolia, each had a host-specific seed predator: Melanterius acaciae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on A. elongata and Diethusa sp. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on A. myrtifolia. Three other species were preyed on by Melanterius corosus, whilst the remaining two species were preyed on by M. maculatus. Variation in the degree of predispersal seed predation was apparent both between populations of any particular Acacia sp. and within species over consecutive fruiting seasons. Some of this variation is in response to varying seed-crop sizes and associated predator satiation. However, since the dynamics of the weevil populations are unknown, much of the variation remains unexplained. Where Acacia spp. occupied the same habitat and were both attacked by one species of predispersal seed predator, differences in seed predator attack were apparent. A. linifolia was more susceptible to M. maculatus attack than was A. terminalis, and A. suaveolens was more readily attacked by M. corosus than was A. longifolia. No differences in seed predator attack were found between A. suaveolens and A. ulicifolia. The importance of this seed predation on the dynamics of the host species is briefly discussed.

TI  - Functional responses of contrasting seed predator guilds to masting in two Mediterranean oak species
PY  - 2017
AB  - The predator satiation hypothesis poses that synchronous and variable seed production during masting events increases seed escape through seed predator satiation. The success of this strategy depends upon the type of consumer functional response, in this case defined as the change in seed consumption rate by a predator as a function of change in seed density. Type II (where the proportion of seed consumed is highest at low levels of seed availability) and type III (where the proportion of seed consumed is highest at some intermediate level of seed availability and then declines towards zero) functional responses describe negative density-dependence and indicate predator satiation. The type of function response should be contingent upon herbivore traits: type II responses are predicted for dietary specialist predators with low mobility, and type III responses are predicted for highly mobile, dietary generalist predators. Surprisingly, most studies have not evaluated whether functional responses vary among seed predator guilds. Here we describe the functional responses at population and individual tree level of highly mobile generalist (birds and rodents) and less mobile specialist (insects) pre-dispersal seed predators attacking acorns of two sympatric oaks (Quercus suber and Q. canariensis) over a 10-year period. Our results showed that in most cases specialist seed predators exhibited the predicted type II functional response at both the individual tree and population level for both oak species. However, generalist seed predators did not exhibit the predicted type III response; instead, they also exhibited a type II response at the individual tree and population level for both oak species. By independently assessing the effects of multiple seed predators associated with the same host tree species, our work highlights the influence of herbivore traits on the outcome of plant–seed predator interactions in masting species, and thus furthers our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying masting behaviour.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of a pulsed resource dynamically drive the distribution of specialist herbivores.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Patterns and drivers of the spatio-temporal distribution of herbivores are key elements of their ecological and evolutionary impacts on plant populations. Herbivore spatial distributions may be influenced by increased (RCH: resource concentration hypothesis) or decreased (RDH: resource dilution hypothesis) resource densities, but the effect of temporal variations in resource densities on such distributions remains poorly documented. We used a survey of a masting tree species and its seed predators in Southeastern France to address the effect of a host’s pulsed resource on the spatio-temporal distributions of highly specialized insect herbivores feeding on seeds. Variations in both resource and seed predator densities were assessed by estimating seed production and seed infestation rates in focus trees during 10 consecutive years. We found increasing seed infestation rates with decreasing host tree densities in years of low seed production, indicating a RDH pattern of seed predators. However, such pattern was not persistent in years of high seed production during which seed infestation rates did not depend on host tree densities. We showed that temporal variations in resource density can lead to transience of seed predator spatial distribution. This study highlights how predictions of plant-herbivore interactions in natural ecosystems may rely on temporal components underlying RCH and RDH hypotheses.

TI  - Proposing the solar-wind energy flux hypothesis as a driver of inter-annual variation in tropical tree reproductive effort.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Premise The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects tropical environmental conditions, potentially altering ecosystem function as El Nino events interact with longer-term climate change. Anomalously warm equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures affect rainfall and temperature throughout the tropics and coincide with altered leaf flush phenology and increased fruit production in wet tropical forests; however, the understanding of mechanisms underlying this pattern is limited. There is evidence that increases in tropical tree reproduction anticipate El Nino onset, motivating the continued search for a global driver of tropical angiosperm reproduction. We present the solar-wind energy flux hypothesis: that physical energy influx to the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere, generated by a positive anomaly in the solar wind preceding El Nino development, cues tropical trees to increase resource allocation to reproduction. Methods We test this hypothesis using 19 years of data from Luquillo, Puerto Rico, correlating them with measures of solar-wind energy. Results From 1994 to 2013, the solar-wind energy flux into Earth's magnetosphere (Ein ) was more strongly correlated with the number of species fruiting and flowering than the Nino 3.4 climate index, despite Nino 3.4 being previously identified as a driver of interannual increases in reproduction. Conclusions Changes in the global magnetosphere and thermosphere conditions from increased solar-wind energy affect global atmospheric pressure and circulation patterns, principally by weakening the Walker circulation. We discuss the idea that these changes cue interannual increases in tropical tree reproduction and act through an unidentified mechanism that anticipates and synchronizes the reproductive output of the tropical trees with El Nino.

TI  - Within-season synchrony of a masting conifer enhances seed escape.
PY  - 2012
AB  - AbstractPredator satiation resulting from interannual reproductive synchrony has been widely documented in masting plants, but how reproductive synchrony within a year influences seed escape is poorly understood. We evaluated whether the intra-annual reproductive synchrony of individual white spruce trees (Picea glauca) increased seed escape from their primary predispersal seed predator, North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Trees with cones that matured synchronously relative to those of other trees within red squirrel territories were significantly more likely to escape squirrel predation in years with both low and superabundant levels of cone production, generating a significantly positive linear selection differential for increasing intra-annual reproductive synchrony. Thus, this masting plant escapes seed predation in numbers through interannual synchrony in seed production and in time through intra-annual synchrony of seed availability.

TI  - Seed-predator satiation and Janzen-Connell effects vary with spatial scales for seed-feeding insects
PY  - 2016
AB  - Author(s): Xiao, Zhishu; Mi, Xiangcheng; Holyoak, Marcel; Xie, Wenhua; Cao, Ke; Yang, Xifu; Huang, Xiaoqun; Krebs, Charles J | Abstract: Background and aimsThe Janzen-Connell model predicts that common species suffer high seed predation from specialized natural enemies as a function of distance from parent trees, and consequently as a function of conspecific density, whereas the predator satiation hypothesis predicts that seed attack is reduced due to predator satiation at high seed densities. Pre-dispersal predation by insects was studied while seeds are still on parent trees, which represents a frequently overlooked stage in which seed predation occurs.MethodsReproductive tree density and seed production were investigated from ten Quercus serrata populations located in south-west China, quantifying density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation over two years by three insect groups.Key resultsAcorn infestation was nearly twice as high in the low-seed year as that in the high-seed year, with considerable spatio-temporal variation in the direction and magnitude of density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation evident. Across whole populations of trees, a high density of reproductive trees caused predator satiation and reduced insect attack in the high-seed year. Within individual trees, and consistent with the Janzen-Connell model, overall insect seed predation was positively correlated with seed production in the low-seed year. In addition, there was variation among insect taxa, with positive density-dependent seed predation by Curculio weevils in the high-seed year and moths in the low-seed year, but apparent density independence by Cyllorhynchites weevils in both years.ConclusionsThe overall trend of negative density-dependent, pre-dispersal seed predation suggests that predator satiation limited the occurrence of Janzen-Connell effects across Q. serrata populations. Such effects may have large impacts on plant population dynamics and tree diversity, depending on the extent to which they are reduced by counteracting positive density-dependent predation for seeds on individual trees and other factors affecting successful recruitment.

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL TESTS OF THE SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALE OF SEED PREDATION IN MAST‐FRUITING DIPTEROCARPACEAE
PY  - 2000
AB  - Mast-fruiting Dipterocarpaceae exhibit highly synchronous, interspecific seedfall at irregular, multiyear intervals. To investigate how the temporal pattern of seedfall affects dipterocarp seed and seedling survival, in both a logged and a primary lowland tropical forest, we planted Shorea stenoptera Burck seeds in the last three weeks of a 12- wk synchronous dipterocarp seedfall during a major community mast-fruiting event in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. As a result of commercial timber harvest of dipterocarp individuals eight years before, total dipterocarp seed production in the logged site was only 23% of that in the primary forest. At both sites, an average of 35 kg of seed was sown across a large area (?1 kM2) to examine the spatial pattern of seed destruction. During the period in which "natural" community mast seed was available to predators, 92% and 99% of experimentally sown seed escaped predators in logged and in primary forest, respectively. After regional seed resources were exhausted, nomadic vertebrates (primarily the bearded pig, Sus barbatus) were observed in both forest areas, and all ungerminated seed was destroyed. Seed predators arrived earlier in the logged area, before most experimentally sown seed had germinated, and the logged site experienced greater seed loss to vertebrates than did the primary forest. Because nomadic seed predators were absent during peak fruit fall of naturally occurring communities at both study sites, there was no evidence of local predator satiation. Rather, experimentally sown seed escaped predation because of rapid germination before predator arrival, as opposed to being ignored by satiated predators. Seed escape was more dependent on the late arrival of pigs than on the amount of local seed production. There was no significant spatial autocorrelation of seed predation. All remaining seed at the scale of the experiment (>1 kM2) was destroyed by predators. These findings suggest that satiation of nomadic predators occurs at the landscape scale. Postdispersal seed predators caused significantly greater seed destruction in the exper- imentally sown seed populations than in naturally dispersed, mast-fruiting communities at both sites. In both logged and primary forests, there was significantly greater loss of experimentally sown seed to predation than was found in the entire natural mast-fruiting Shorea community combined (21 spp.). Moreover, a naturally occurring, but late-fruiting, Shorea species also exhibited greater seed losses to predation than did all other species within each mast-fruiting community, and these proportional losses were similar to those observed in the experimentally sown seeds. Seeds that escaped predation and vertebrate herbivory on post-establishment seedlings dis- played high survival, indicating that the availability of suitable microsites did not limit re- cruitment. In the primary forest, 65% of the germinated experimental seed that survived early causes of mortality was alive 40 mo post-planting, which coincided with the next mast-fruiting event. The spatial distribution of these seedlings was modified primarily by the foraging behavior of vertebrate seed predators in the first two weeks post-planting. The influence of vertebrate predation on seed and seedling survival suggests that foraging behavior by terrestrial vertebrate seed predators may cause directional and/or stabilizing selection for synchronous, interspecific supra-annual dipterocarp seed production across forest regions in Kalimantan.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen deposition on reproduction in a masting tree: benefits of higher seed production are trumped by negative biotic interactions
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary
Relatively little is known about the effects of anthropogenic environmental changes on reproductive ecology of trees. Yet, recruitment is a primary determinant of the long-term dynamics of plant populations in changing environments.
We used the Long-Term Ecological Research site at Harvard Forest to evaluate the effects of chronic (over 25 years) nitrogen fertilization on reproductive ecology of red oaks (Quercus rubra).
Oaks growing in fertilized plots produced 4-9 times more acorns than control trees. However, nitrogen deposition simultaneously affected oaks’ biotic interactions. It increased pre-dispersal seed predation by insects (primarily weevils, Curculio spp.) on fertilized plots, most likely as the result of the disruption of predator satiation. In addition, infestation by weevils was more likely to result in embryo destruction in fertilized than in control acorns. Furthermore, the proportion of acorns dispersed and cached by rodents decreased on fertilized plots. Finally, germination of fertilized acorns was lower than control acorns, even after controlling for effects of weevils and rodents.
Inclusion of the altered biotic interactions reversed the final picture of the effects of long-term nitrogen fertilization on oak reproduction: the positive effects on acorn quantity were trumped by the nitrogen-mediated changes in biotic interactions.
Synthesis. Our results stress the importance of considering indirect effects and consumer interactions when evaluating effects of environmental change on plant population dynamics. Long-term nitrogen fertilization has a strong potential to decrease the recruitment of masting trees. Given the ubiquitous increase in the anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, processes similar to those found in our system might operate in others, resulting in a widespread alteration of trees’ recruitment dynamics.

TI  - Resiliency in masting systems: Do evolved seed escape strategies benefit an endangered pine?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Satiation of predispersal seed predators by mast years has been demonstrated in many intact ecosystems. When disease causes mortality of seed-bearing trees in an ecosystem, the abundance of food sources may alter seed predator behavior and abundance, and the ecosystem services derived from mutualistic seed dispersers. We used the endangered limber pine (Pinus flexilis) to examine whether the benefits of interannual variation in cone production vary depending on the severity of white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) infections, the abundance of seed predator populations, and stand characteristics. We compared infection level, cone production, cone predation, and abundance of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in 17 stands over two mast years and two nonmast years. Stands were selected from a southern and northern ecosystem within Alberta's montane ecoregion, with varying forest composition and history of blister rust infection. Considerable variability in interannual cone production, and proportionately greater cone escape (those remaining in stands) in the 2010 mast year led to 10 times greater cone escape overall in the mast year than in nonmast years. Model selection using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) suggests that both cone escape and proportion cone escape from seed predators depended primarily on temporal variability in cone production among mast vs. nonmast years, basal area of canopy trees within stands, squirrel abundance, and ecosystem differences. Several two-way and three-way interactions between masting, ecosystems, and predator abundance were selected by AIC for inclusion into the best model of the a priori candidate set for both the cone escape model and proportion cone escape model. Our study suggests that masting confers temporal resiliency in seed escape in declining limber pine ecosystems, even under varying disease and seed predator threats. These findings also suggest that evolved seed escape strategies may be resilient to a variety of ecological conditions, including low reproductive capacity. Nonetheless, proximate ecological conditions may determine the fate of declining species, as predator behavior differed between ecosystems, and greater net cone escape in favorable stands may be necessary to attract mutualistic seed dispersers.

TI  - Andromonoecy in Four Australian Species of Leptospermum
PY  - 1990
AB  - Leptospermum myrsinoides, L. juniperinum, L. laevigatum and L. lanigerum are recorded as being andromonoecious, with the proportion of total flowers that is functionally male averaging 36, 42, 48 and 14% respectively at Wilson's Promontory during the 1981-83 flowering seasons. For each species, this figure varied markedly between individual plants, sites and seasons: for example, for L. myrsinoides it ranged from 0 to 80% among individual plants at one site on one occasion, from 31 to 71% at one site over three seasons, and from 31 to 71% at different sites during the one season. This variation is consistent with the view that andromonoecy enables plants to regulate their sexual expression according to changing environmental conditions. Rates of insect predation of male flowers (usually 52%) were consistently lower than those of bisexual flowers (usually 5-10%) and in L. myrsinoides there was a negative correlation between the rate of predation of bisexual flowers and the proportion of total flowers that was male. A hypothesis is proposed that a benefit of andromonoecy is the satiation of flower predators.

TI  - Variation and synchrony of tree species mast seeding in an old‐growth temperate forest
PY  - 2017
AB  - Questions
Mast seeding, synchronous highly variable seed production among years, occurs in many perennial plant species and across diverse plant communities. Two predominant ultimate hypotheses for mast seeding are pollination efficiency and predator satiation, with weather conditions as a proximate cause. Little consensus has been achieved regarding the relative impacts of ultimate selection and proximate weather on variation in seed production. Moreover, mast-seeding studies often focus on a single species or phylogenetically closely related species, while studies on plant communities consisting of tree species with a diversity of reproductive strategies are less common.

Location
The 25-ha Changbaishan temperate forest dynamic plot, Northeast China.

Methods
We used eight-years of seed rain data to characterize the patterns and evaluate underlying selective drivers of mast seeding. We employed generalized linear mixed-effects models to analyze the relationships between interannual variability of mast seeding and weather conditions.

Results
All 20 species in this forest community exhibited high variability in annual seed production, but the magnitude of seed production among species was generally asynchronous across years. Wind-pollinated species had higher interannual variation of seed production than animal-pollinated species, while species dispersed by seed predators and abiotic modes (e.g., wind and gravity) showed little variation. Species responded individually to weather conditions for both temperature and precipitation, and spring phenology at the same year as seed production had a larger effect among species than both the weather conditions of the same summer and season-long lags.

Conclusions
Our findings suggest that pollination efficiency hypothesis hada much stronger effect than predation satiation hypothesis on mast seeding, and weather conditions showed the proximate role of weather drivers in producing the community-wide mast seeding pattern. We emphasize the necessity to simultaneously assess drivers of mast seeding for multiple species within a plant community.

TI  - Plant reproductive phenology over four years including an episode of general flowering in a lowland dipterocarp forest, Sarawak, Malaysia
PY  - 1999
AB  - The first systematic observation of a general flowering, a phenomenon unique to lowland mixed-dipterocarp forests in Southeast Asia, is presented. During general flowering, which occurs at irregular intervals of 3‐10 yr, nearly all dipterocarp species together with species of other families come heavily into flower. We monitored reproductive phenology of 576 individual plants representing 305 species in 56 families in Sarawak, Malaysia. Observations continued for 53 mo from August 1992 and covered one episode of a general flowering cycle. Among 527 effective reproductive events during 43 mo, 57% were concentrated in the general flowering period (GFP) of 10 mo in 1996. We classified 257 species into flowering types based on timing and frequency of flowering. The most abundant type was ‘‘general flowering’’ (35%), which flowered only during GFP. The others were ‘‘supra-annual’’ (19%), ‘‘annual’’ (13%), and ‘‘sub-annual’’ (5%) types. General flowering type and temporal aggregation in reproductive events were commonly found among species in various categories of taxonomic groups, life forms, pollination systems, and fruit types. Possible causes for general flowering, such as promotion of pollination brought about by interspecific synchronization and paucity of climatic cues suitable for flowering trigger, are proposed, in addition to the predator satiation hypothesis of Janzen (1974).

TI  - Alternate bearing, predator satiation and seedling recruitment in Quercus robur L.
PY  - 1995
AB  - 1 We investigated the relationship between seed production and seedling recruitment in Quercus robur in order to determine whether oak recruitment was seed-limited, herbivore-limited or microsite-limited. Over a 15-year period, Q. robur showed a pattern of alternate bearing, with significant (but not complete) synchrony between individual trees at several sites in south-east England. 2 Seedling recruitment was assessed in three ways: by annual destructive sampling, by monitoring permanent quadrats, and by ageing destructive samples of saplings using basal ring counts. 3 Seedling recruitment was closely correlated with the size of the acorn crop in some habitats but not others. In Sunningdale, where a competition-free seed bed was available every year and where seed predators were relatively scarce, oak seedlings appeared almost every year, and three peak densities of seedling recruitment followed three peaks of acorn production during the period 1985-92. In Silwood Park, where rabbits were abundant, there was little seedling recruitment except within rabbit exclosures and then only in years of peak acorn production. In Windsor Great Park, rabbit densities were lower and seedling recruitment was higher than at Silwood Park, but the association between seedling recruitment and acorn production could not be established with confidence because of imprecision in ageing the saplings. 4 Rates of acorn loss to invertebrate seed predators were broadly consistent with the hypothesis of predator satiation; low acorn crops suffered a higher percentage mortality than large acorn crops. The two principal acorn-feeding insects (the alien cynipid gall wasp Andricus quercuscalicis and the native weevil Curculio glandium) killed between 30% and 90% of the acorn crop in given years and between 0% and 100% of the acorn crop on individual trees. Vertebrate herbivores (principally rabbits and wood mice) destroyed most of the sound acorns in low years, removing experimentally placed acorns within 24 h. 5 The effectiveness of alternate bearing as a defence against short-lived, specialist insect herbivores and long-lived, generalist vertebrate herbivores is discussed. The evidence presently available does not allow us to discriminate between the competing hypotheses that alternate bearing is an evolved, antipredator strategy on the part of the oaks, or a constraint imposed by limited resource availability within the trees. 6 We conclude that the relationship between seed production and seedling recruitment in Quercus robur is variable from site to site: oak recruitment is seed-limited in open sites where vertebrate herbivores are scarce, microsite-limited beneath a dense forest canopy, but herbivore-limited in other sites, especially those where rabbits are abundant.

TI  - Seed production and predation in a changing climate: new roles for resource and seed predator feedback?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Climate change may cause changes in the dynamics of populations beyond comparatively simple directional effects. To better understand complex effects on dynamics requires long-term studies of populations that experience changes in climatic conditions. We study the dynamics of a seed-production-seed-predation system, consisting of a perennial herb and its two seed predatory insects, over a 40-yr period during which climate change has caused the annual growing season to increase by 20 d. During this period, plant patches have increased almost threefold in size and seed production has slipped into a pattern of alternate high and low years with a higher variance than in the beginning of the period. We find that seed production is associated with precipitation of the present summer and a non-linear feedback from seed production of the previous year. When previous year's seed production is low, weather forcing and unexplained noise determine the extent of seed production. When previous seed production is high, depleted resources limit seed production. Resource depletion happened frequently in the latter parts of the study but rarely in the beginning. The changing patterns of seed production in turn affect the dynamics of seed predation, which is dominated by one of the seed predators. Its dynamics are strongly linked to seed density fluctuations, but its population growth rate is satiated when resource fluctuations become too large. In the latter part of the study period, when seed fluctuations were alternating between years of high and low density, satiation was common and there was a large increase in surviving seeds in good years. Our study illustrates that a changing climate can fundamentally influence patterns of long-term dynamics at multiple trophic levels.

TI  - Does masting result in frugivore satiation? A test with Manilkara trees in French Guiana
PY  - 2015
AB  - Species showing mast seeding synchronously produce large amounts of fruits during some scattered years. This massive crop has been hypothesized to improve dispersal effectiveness by a satiation of seed predators, but the consequences for seed dispersers have barely been studied in the tropics. We tested the hypothesis that masting resulted in satiation of frugivorous dispersers using the study case of two Manilkara species growing in an Amazonian forest in French Guiana. Seed dispersal was estimated by means of seed traps in two forest types during a 10-y monitoring. Manilkara huberi and M. bidentata showed three fruiting events in a time span of 10 y (in 2001, 2006 and 2010). Estimates of seed dispersal from 2001 and 2010 showed that satiation of frugivores only occurred in the year with the largest crop of Manilkara (2010) and in the habitat where the diversity of primate-dispersed species retrieved in seed traps was the highest (Grand Plateau, with clay soils), while fruit consumers did not seem to be satiated in other instances. Spatio-temporal variability of seed production and the community-crop context are therefore affecting satiation of frugivores during masting events.

TI  - Long‐term seed survival and dispersal dynamics in a rodent‐dispersed tree: testing the predator satiation hypothesis and the predator dispersal hypothesis
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Mast seeding in animal-dispersed plants has previously been accounted for by two main hypotheses: the predator satiation hypothesis (that it increases seed survival and establishment before dispersal) and the predator dispersal hypothesis (that it increases seed dispersal or dispersal distance). However, neither hypothesis has been rigorously tested with simultaneous data on seed production, seed predation and seed dispersal by vertebrate seed predators. 2. We studied oil tea Camellia oleifera (Theaceae) seed production for eight years (2002–2009) in a subtropical forest in south-west China, and investigated how annual seed and rodent abundance determined per capita seed availability for rodent seed predators and seed dispersers and how seed and rodent abundance were related to seed dispersal and seed survival via scatter-hoarding. We predicted the patterns of seed dispersal and survival to test the two hypotheses about mast seeding. Edward’s long-tailed rat Leopoldamys edwardsi acted as the principal seed disperser of oil tea seeds because of scatter-hoarding, while other sympatric rodent species acted only as seed predators. 3. We first provided a reasonable method to estimate per capita seed availability based on annual seed abundance and annual metabolic rodent abundance (corrected for metabolic-scaling body mass of each rodent species). We found that annual seed abundance, annual metabolic rodent abundance and per capita seed availability all had some significant effects on different estimators of seed fates (including dispersal distances) across each stage from seedfall to seedling establishment. Both annual seed abundance and per capita seed availability were positively correlated with pre-dispersal seed survival, but negatively correlated with scatter-hoarding (and recaching), seed survival after dispersal and dispersal distances. However, annual metabolic rodent abundance had a positive effect on scatter-hoarding, but had a negative effect on the time to cache recovery. 4. Synthesis. Since greater seed production was associated with improvement in pre-dispersal survival of oil tea seeds but a reduction in dispersal (including secondary dispersal and dispersal distance), our long-term study indicates that, compared with the predator dispersal hypothesis, the predator satiation hypothesis provides a better mechanism predicting seed dispersal and seed survival in animal-dispersed plants by integrating seed abundance and animal abundance.

TI  - Spatial Dynamics of Specialist Seed Predators on Synchronized and Intermittent Seed Production of Host Plants
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract: Masting, the synchronized and intermittent seed production by plant populations, provides highly variable food resources for specialist seed predators. Such a reproductive mode helps minimize seed losses through predator satiation and extinction of seed predator populations. The seed predators can buffer the resource variation through dispersal or extended diapause. We developed a spatially explicit resource‐consumer model to understand the effect of masting on specialist seed predators. The masting dynamics were assumed to follow a resource‐based model for plant reproduction, and the population dynamics of the predator were represented by a spatially extended Nicholson‐Bailey model. The resultant model demonstrated that when host plants reproduce intermittently, seed predator populations go locally extinct, but global persistence of the predator is facilitated by dispersal or extended diapause. Global extinction of the predator resulted when the intermittent reproduction is highly synchronized ...

TI  - Seed scatterhoarding by white-tailed rats: consequences for seedling recruitment by an Australian rain forest tree
PY  - 2001
AB  - The role of white-tailed rats (Uromys caudimaculatus) as dispersers of seeds of the Australian tropical rain forest tree Beilschmiedia bancroftii, (Lauraceae) was investigated by following the fates of seeds and seedlings over 2 y. Fruits of this tree are too large to be consumed by any avian frugivore except the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), and the only other native mammal capable of dispersing the seeds is the musky rat kangaroo (Hypsiprimnodon moschatus). However, neither of these species has been documented to disperse the seeds of this tree. During a mast year, white-tailed rats cached seeds an average of 13 m from parent trees in a variety of microsites. Although none of the 61 cached seeds followed in this study survived to germination, comparison of seed, cache and seedling distributions suggested that most seedlings arose from rat-cached seeds. White-tailed rats cached seeds in both mast and non-mast years, but the time seeds remained on the forest floor and in caches was significantly shorter in non-mast years, suggesting that synchronous seed production increases the probability that some caches survive to germination. Because white-tailed rats are the most common and widespread native mammal capable of dispersing large-seeds, this study suggests that they may play an important role in the seed and seedling dynamics of large-seeded tree species in Australian tropical rain forests.

TI  - The role of historical and ecological factors on initial survival of Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Fabaceae)
PY  - 2013
AB  - The plant population dynamic is affected by ecological and evolutionary processes that operate at all stages of the plant life cycle. The aim of this study was to characterize the seed and seedling performance of Copaifera langsdorffii by testing four hypotheses: the resource concentration hypothesis; the relationship between seed size and germinability hypothesis; the relationship between seed size and seedling vigor hypothesis; and the intraspecific seedling competition hypothesis. All seeds used in the experiments were collected from 35 C. langsdorffii plants located in a fragment of the Brazilian cerrado (savanna). The number of fruits per plant negatively affected Rhinochenus brevicollis attacks on C. langsdorffii seeds. Therefore, this result does not support the resource concentration hypothesis, and predator satiation was used in order to explain the observed result. In general, seed germinability (percentage and time to emergence) was not influenced by seed size. The homogeneity of the experimental design, together with an abundant water supply, may have masked the effects of seed size on germinability. Seed size positively affected seedling development, corroborating the expected relationship between seed size and seedling vigor. The number of seedling per plastic bags negatively affected the growth of C. langsdorffii. The nutrient-limited soil probably promoted the below-ground competition for nutrients among seedlings. Finally, the role of evolutionary and ecological factors on C. langsdorffii population dynamics is discussed.

TI  - Strict mast fruiting for a tropical dipterocarp tree: a demographic cost–benefit analysis of delayed reproduction and seed predation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Masting, the production of large seed crops at intervals of several years, is a reproductive adaptation displayed by many tree species. The predator satiation hypothesis predicts that starvation of seed predators between mast years and satiation during mast years decreases seed predation and thus enhances tree regeneration. 2. Mast fruiting comes at demographic costs such as missed reproduction opportunities and increased density-dependence of recruits, but it remains unknown if predator satiation constitutes a sufficiently large benefit for masting to evolve as a viable life-history strategy. So far, no studies have quantified the net fitness consequences of masting. 3. Using a long-term demographic data set of the dipterocarp Shorea leprosula in a Malaysian forest, we constructed stochastic matrix population models and performed a demographic cost–benefit analysis. 4. For observed values of mast frequency and seed predation rates, we show that strict masting strongly increases fitness compared with fruiting annually. Model results also show that the demographic costs of mast fruiting are very low compared to the demographic losses due to seed predation in a scenario of annual fruiting. Finally, we find that mast fruiting would still be selected for even at low levels of seed predation and when including additional costs such as decreased adult growth rates, limiting crop size and density-dependent seedling survival. 5. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the predator satiation hypothesis: mast fruiting increases fitness for a range of seed predation levels. Under seed predation pressure annually fruiting species are at a strong disadvantage and as a result a mast fruiting strategy may swiftly confer a fitness advantage. Our study shows that demographic modelling allows the weighing of fitness benefits and costs of life-history phenomena such as strict masting.

TI  - Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) establishment in boreal forest: results of a transplantation experiment
PY  - 2004
AB  - Aim  To evaluate whether seedlings of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) can establish beyond the species northern range limit in adjacent boreal forest.



Location  The hardwood–boreal forest transition zone on the north-east shore of Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada.



Methods  Seed fall of sugar maple was monitored for 5 years in a stand of this species at its northern range limit, and seed from this stand was transplanted to five micro-habitat types in an adjacent boreal forest. The establishment and survival of sugar maple seedlings there, and in the seed-source stand, was monitored for the following 7–11 years. Soil-surface light levels were measured in both forest types.



Results  Most seed fell in the final year of monitoring, when c. 250 seeds m−2 were recorded. First-year seedling establishment rates in the maple stand, deriving from this mast seed year, was approximately double that deriving from seed transplanted to the boreal forest sites; this is tentatively attributed to seed predator satiation in the maple stand. However, subsequent seedling survivorship in the boreal forest was greater than that in the maple stand, resulting in comparable seedling densities by the end of 6 years. This difference is tentatively attributed to better illumination in the boreal forest sites, and canopy-opening disturbances appear to be especially facilitative of seedling survival.



Main conclusions  There is no fundamental impediment to sugar maple seedlings establishing in boreal forest communities if climate warming occurs and seed is available. If management intervention is needed to accelerate seed availability in a rapidly warming boreal forest, then diffuse seed application to disturbed boreal forest sites during mast years of local boreal tree species is recommended as the most effective way of avoiding seed predation and increasing seedling survival.

TI  - Testing the quick meal hypothesis: The effect of pulp on hoarding and seed predation of Hymenaea courbaril by red‐rumped agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina)
PY  - 2006
AB  - Red-rumped agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina) are important seed dispersers/predators of Neotropical large-seeded plants. Several species of seeds cached by agoutis have an edible reward, in contrast to temperate rodent-dispersed diaspores. The quick meal hypothesis states that the presence of a reward such as edible pulp will enhance the efficiency of rodents as seed disperses by satiating the animal and, consequently, reducing seed predation and enhancing hoarding. In this study, this hypothesis was tested using as the reference system the pulp and seeds of Hymenaea courbaril. Seeds with and without pulp were offered to agoutis and the behaviour of each individual was recorded. Since the probability of predation and hoarding were complementary, we used the probability of predation. The proportion of agoutis that preyed on at least one seed was similar for seeds with (42.8% of individuals) and without (40.0% of individuals) pulp. In agoutis that preyed upon at least one seed, the probability that they killed a seed did not differ between seeds with (0.17 ± 0.03) and without (0.20 ± 0.08) pulp. Hence, these results do not support the 'quick meal hypothesis'.

TI  - Community structure of pre-dispersal seed predatory insects on eleven Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) species.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Dipterocarpaceae in South-East Asia are known for their strict mast fruiting. During fruiting, pre-dispersal seed predation by insects contributes to mortality of dipterocarp seeds. We documented the community structure of insect seed predators on 11 Shorea species in Peninsular Malaysia. Fruits were sampled sequentially throughout seed development, and 2144 and 1655 individuals of seed predator weevils and moths were collected in two mast-fruiting events. Four weevils: Nanophyes shoreae, nanophyid sp. 1, Alcidodes dipterocarpi and Alcidodes humeralis, and one moth Andrioplecta shoreae were abundant in seeds of the Shorea species. The proportion of N. shoreae to the total predators became larger in the latter fruiting event than the former while that of Alcidodes spp. became smaller. The predator species composition changed during seed development; nanophyid spp. emerged from immature fruits while Alcidodes spp. emerged from mature fruits. Andrioplecta shoreae emerged from both immature and mature fruits. The level of host specificity measured by Kullback–Leibler distance was low for most predator species in both events. Predator species composition of many Shorea was similar to each other due to the dominance of N. shoreae though it might gradually differ with the phylogenetic distance between hosts. In conclusion, predator species composition of Shorea varied during seed development within a host rather than among hosts. Intermittent synchronized fruiting by congeneric Shorea trees would be advantageous to avoid pre-dispersal insect seed predators, and contribute to their reproduction.

TI  - Reproductive success of individuals with different fruit production patterns. What does it mean for the predator satiation hypothesis
PY  - 2012
AB  - The predator satiation hypothesis states that synchronous periodic production of seeds is an adaptive strategy evolved to reduce the pressure of seed predators. The seed production pattern is crucial to the predator satiation hypothesis, but there are few studies documenting the success of individuals that are in synchrony and out of synchrony with the whole population. This study is based on long-term data on seed production of Sorbus aucuparia and specialised pre-dispersal seed predation by Argyresthia conjugella, in a subalpine spruce forest in the Western Carpathians (Poland). At the population level, we tested whether functional and numerical responses of predators to the variation of fruit production operate. At the individual level, we tested whether individuals with higher interannual variability in their own seed crops and higher synchrony with the population have higher percentages of uninfested fruits. The intensity of pre-dispersal seed predation was high (average 70 %; range 19–100 %). There were both functional and numerical responses of predators to the variation of fruit production at the population level. We found that individuals that were expected to be preferred under seed predator pressure had higher reproductive success. With increasing synchrony of fruit production between individual trees and the population, the percentage of infested fruits decreased. There was also a negative relationship between the interannual variation in individual fruit production and the percentage of infested fruits. These results confirm selection for individuals with a masting strategy. However, the population does not seem well adapted to strong seed predation pressure and we suggest that this may be a result of prolonged diapause of A. conjugella.

TI  - 6-year periodicity and variable synchronicity in a mass-flowering plant.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Periodical organisms, such as bamboos and periodical cicadas, are very famous for their synchronous reproduction. In bamboos and other periodical plants, the synchronicity of mass-flowering and withering has been often reported indicating these species are monocarpic (semelparous) species. Therefore, synchronicity and periodicity are often suspected to be fairly tightly coupled traits in these periodical plants. We investigate the periodicity and synchronicity of Strobilanthes flexicaulis, and a closely related species S. tashiroi on Okinawa Island, Japan. The genus Strobilanthes is known for several periodical species. Based on 32-year observational data, we confirmed that S. flexicaulis is 6-year periodical mass-flowering monocarpic plant. All the flowering plants had died after flowering. In contrast, we found that S. tashiroi is a polycarpic perennial with no mass-flowering from three-year individual tracking. We also surveyed six local populations of S. flexicaulis and found variation in the synchronicity from four highly synchronized populations (>98% of plants flowering in the mass year) to two less synchronized one with 11–47% of plants flowering before and after the mass year. This result might imply that synchrony may be selected for when periodicity is established in monocarpic species. We found the selective advantages for mass-flowering in pollinator activities and predator satiation. The current results suggest that the periodical S. flexicaulis might have evolved periodicity from a non-periodical close relative. The current report should become a key finding for understanding the evolution of periodical plants.

TI  - MASTING IN ANIMAL-DISPERSED PINES FACILITATES SEED DISPERSAL
PY  - 2002
AB  - Masting increases the efficiency of wind pollination and satiates seed predators, but there is little evidence that masting facilitates seed dispersal by animals. Masting in pines was studied over three field seasons by simulating seed crops in synchrony (mast years, autumn 1998 and 1999) or out of synchrony (non-mast year, autumn 2000) with the local population. Rodents removed simulated wind-dispersed Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) seeds significantly more rapidly in mast years than in the non-mast year. Radioisotopes were used to follow the fates of individual pine seeds taken from three source trees. Rodents cached nearly all experimental seeds in mast and non-mast years, making 562 caches in 1998, 510 caches in 1999, and 1034 caches in 2000. Mean dispersal distances of seeds in primary caches were 5.9 and 4.6 m (28.6% and 22.1%) farther in the two mast years than in the non-mast year. Rodents often excavated cached seeds and moved them to new sites (secondary caching). During mast years, some seeds were found in as many as three cache sites, but during the non-mast year, the level of secondary caching approximately tripled, with some seeds being found in five or six separate cache sites. Large seed crops were associated with reduced secondary caching of seeds, reduced seed consumption, and greater seed survival in the following spring. Animal-mediated seed dispersal may be a selective force, along with predator satiation and increased efficiency of wind pollination, driving temporal variation in seed production in some large-seeded pines.

TI  - How plants manipulate the scatter-hoarding behaviour of seed-dispersing animals
PY  - 2010
AB  - Some plants that are dispersed by scatter-hoarding animals appear to have evolved the ability to manipulate the behaviour of those animals to increase the likelihood that seeds and nuts will be stored and that a portion of those items will not be recovered. Plants have achieved this in at least four ways. First, by producing large, nutritious seeds and nuts that are attractive to animals and that stimulate hoarding behaviour. Second, by imposing handling costs that cause animals to hoard rather than to eat items immediately. These handling costs can take one of two forms: physical barriers (e.g. hard seed coats) that take time to remove and secondary chemicals (e.g. tannins) that impose metabolic costs. Third, by masting, where a population of plants synchronizes reproductive effort, producing large nut crops at intervals of several years. Mast crops not only satiate seed predators, but also increase the amount of seed dispersal because scatter-hoarding animals are not easily satiated during caching (causing animals to store more food than they can consume) but are satiated during cache recovery. And fourth, by producing seeds that do not emit strong odours so that buried seeds are less likely to be discovered. These, and perhaps other, traits have increased the relative success of plant species with seeds dispersed by scatter-hoarding animals.

TI  - Simulation of oak early life history and interactions with disturbance via an individual-based model, SOEL.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Early tree life history and demography are driven by interactions with the environment such as seed predation, herbivory, light availability, and drought. For oak (Quercus) in the eastern United States, these interactions may contribute to oak regeneration failure. Numerous studies have examined the impact of individual factors (like seed predation) on the oak regeneration process, but less information is available on the relative and combined impacts of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors on early oak life history. We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit model to Simulate Oak Early Life history (SOEL). The model connects acorn survival, acorn dispersal, germination, seedling growth, and seedling survival submodels based on empirical data with an existing gap model (JABOWA). Using SOEL, we assessed the sensitivity of several metrics of oak regeneration to different parameters associated with early oak life history. We also applied the model in three individual case studies to assess: (1) how variable acorn production interacts with timing of timber harvest; (2) the effect of shelterwood harvest-induced differences on seed predation; and (3) the consequences of interactions between drought, seedling growth and survival, and timber harvest. We found that oak regeneration metrics including percent emergence, seedling density, and sapling density were most sensitive to the amount of acorn production, acorn caching probability by scatterhoarders, and seedling growth rates. In the case studies, we found that timing harvest to follow large acorn crops can increase the density of oak regeneration in the short term following harvest, at least under some conditions. Following midstory removal, lower weevil infestation probability and lower post-dispersal acorn survival resulted in a modest decline in seedling density, but the decline did not persist to the sapling life stage class. Drought frequency had a powerful negative impact on both growth and survival for individual seedlings, which resulted in large reductions in both seedling and sapling density. The case studies presented here represent only a few examples of what could be accomplished within the SOEL modeling framework. Further studies could focus on different early life history parameters, or connect the parameter values to different predictor variables based on field data.

TI  - Patterns and mechanisms of masting in the large-seeded southern hemisphere conifer Araucaria araucana
PY  - 2008
AB  - Masting, the intermittent and synchronous production of large seed crops, may result from either of two major processes: resource matching and economy of scale. Components of cone production in Araucaria araucana were partitioned among populations and trees to ascertain the existence of masting and the processes involved. Cone production data from seven populations were obtained during a 9-year period and seed gathering data were available for an 18-year time series from six sites in an area of more than 7600 km 2 . Araucaria araucana showed environmentally triggered, intermittent, moderately fluctuating, and highly regionally synchronous reproduction.The mean pairwise correlations of cones production among populations and seed gathering sites were 0.89 and 0.74, respectively, suggesting synchrony in reproduction. Among trees we observed a mean correlation of 0.74 with values ranging from 0.66 to 0.81 for the analysed populations.The existence of negative autocorrelation in seed production between year 0 and year -2 at the individual tree level suggests the presence of 'switching' or internal resource allocation, thus discarding the Resource Matching hypothesis. Mean coefficient of variation (CVp) among populations was moderate (0.95) and similar to the modal CVp values reported in the published reports. Mean CVi among individual trees was 1.16, suggesting a large number of equally and synchronously fluctuating trees, rather than a few largely fluctuating individuals. These results suggest that pollination efficiency and/or predator satiation hypotheses could be responsible for the masting cycles in this conifer. Ancillary data about limitation of airborne pollen dispersion and temporal variation in the amount of seeds per cone and about seed predator satiation, also support both proposed mechanisms.

TI  - Flower and fruit development of Parkia pendula (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae)
PY  - 2009
AB  - Parkia pendula occurs in Brazil in Amazonia and in the northeastern Atlantic Forest. In the latter, its buds, nectar, and seedpod gum are discussed to be keystone resources for the mammalian fauna. To enhance the knowledge about these important nourishment sources, the aim of this study was to detect and describe distinct phases in the flower and pod development. The study was conducted in a 306 ha forest fragment in Igarassu, Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Six morphometrical variables were measured weekly at five inflorescences of two individuals from September 2003 to January 2004. Eleven distinct developmental phases were identified in the 21 weeks lasting development from the very first inflorescences to mature pods and are described in detail. These phases are good predictors for the flowering and fruiting phenology of P. pendula, since they are easily distinguishable from the forest floor. Furthermore, highly synchronized abortions of inflorescences, buds, and pods were observed which support the previously assumed predator satiation defense strategy in Parkia.

TI  - Direct seeding for restoration of mixed oak forests: Influence of distance to forest edge, predator-derived repellent and acorn size on seed removal by granivorous rodents
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Restoration of mixed oak forest in northern temperate regions is important for biodiversity and for adaptation of forest management to climate change. Direct seeding has been considered as a cost-effective method for the assisted regeneration of oaks. However, removal of acorns by granivorous rodents hinders its application. Patterns of acorn removal can vary with habitat type, presence of predators, and acorn size. In this field study, we tested the effects of distance to forest edge, predator excrement as a repellent, and acorn size on the performance of direct-seeded oak in southern Sweden. The experiment was carried out at two different sites. Our hypotheses were: (i) in clear-cuts, acorn removal is higher closer to the forest edge compared to open areas, (ii) treatment with predator excrement reduces acorn removal without affecting germination, and (iii) larger acorns will be removed more readily than smaller acorns. Finally, we also investigated if seedlings from larger acorns survive better and grow taller compared to smaller acorns in relation to habitat structure and predator excrement as repellent. Acorn removal differed at the two sites. At Skrylle (older clear-cut), no forest edge effects were found. At Klaverod (new clear-cut site), our results suggest that removal of acorns was higher in the open clear-cut due to the presence of large slash piles. Less vegetation coverage correlated with lower rates of acorn removal, except near slash piles. Our results therefore suggest that forest managers should reduce understory vegetation and avoid slash piles during direct seeding of oak. Mink excrement failed to protect acorns against removal, but did not reduce acorn germination. Bigger acorns produced taller seedlings but did not enhance overall woodland establishment due to their higher removal rate. Our results further suggest a potential food satiation effect due to an extra supply of additional food. Satiation manipulation might potentially be a method of mitigating the impact of seed predation by granivorous rodents during the direct seeding of oak, but such an approach requires further research before it could be recommended.

TI  - Climate Change Strengthens Selection for Mast Seeding in European Beech
PY  - 2020
AB  - Climate change is altering patterns of seed production worldwide [1-4], but the potential for evolutionary responses to these changes is poorly understood. Masting (synchronous, annually variable seed production by plant populations) is selectively beneficial through economies of scale that decrease the cost of reproduction per surviving offspring [5-7]. Masting is particularly widespread in temperate trees [8, 9] impacting food webs, macronutrient cycling, carbon storage, and human disease risk [10-12], so understanding its response to climate change is important. Here, we analyze inter-individual variability in plant reproductive patterns and two economies of scale-predator satiation and pollination efficiency-and document how natural selection acting upon them favors masting. Four decades of observations for European beech (Fagus sylvatica) show that predator satiation and pollination efficiency select for individuals with higher inter-annual variability of reproduction and higher reproductive synchrony between individuals. This result confirms the long-standing theory that masting, a population-level phenomenon, is generated by selection on individuals. Furthermore, recent climate-driven increases in mean seed production have increased selection pressure from seed predators but not from pollination efficiency. Natural selection is thus acting to restore the fitness benefits of masting, which have previously decreased under a warming climate [13]. However, selection will likely take far longer (centuries) than climate warming (decades), so in the short-term, tree reproduction will be reduced because masting has become less effective at satiating seed predators. Over the long-term, evolutionary responses to climate change could potentially increase inter-annual variability of seed production of masting species.

TI  - Mammalian Seed Dispersal of Pignut Hickory during Three Fruiting Seasons
PY  - 1983
AB  - Seed removal by mammalian predator—dispersers was monitored weekly for Carya glabra (Juglandacea) in an aok—hickory forest of southern Michigan during three fruiting seasons. It was expected that dispersal patterns would be influenced by annual variation in seed crop size. The prediction is that large crop size enables some seeds to escape predation through satiation of dispersal agents. Within a given year, neither size of crops for individual trees nor average weekly nut fall significantly affected weekly proportion of hickory nuts removed. However, among years, proportional disappearance of nuts was slowest during the year with highest seed prodution. During all three seasons, animals removed only a small percentage for nuts, but this pattern was not the results of satiation. Instead, it is more likely due to selective removal of viable nuts. Because virtually all viable nuts were removed from the parent tree, it is concluded that dispersal in hickories is effective in preventing seedling establishment under the parent tree. However, it might be at the cost of high seed predation. Although predator satiation before dispersal was not demonstrated even during the highest seed—producing year, it is possible that postdispersal satiation may have occurred. Results of this study illustrate a relationship between seed production and seed removal that may be found in other nut—producing trees.

TI  - Intensity of pre‐dispersal seed predation in the invasive legume Leucaena leucocephala is limited by the duration of pod retention
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract  The intensity of seed predation the invasive tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala by the bruchid Acanthoscelides macropthalmus was investigated in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The number of seeds damaged by A. macropthalmus as a proportion of total seeds available was found to increase the longer the pods remained on the tree. Seed predation ranged from a mean of 10.75% of seeds on pods that remained on the plant for 1 month and increased to 53.54% for pods that remained of the plant for 4 months. The low bruchid populations at high pod densities results in ‘predator satiation’. However, pods dehisce over time and the proportion of pods available over time to the bruchid correspondingly declines. By the time bruchid densities build up, most pods have dehisced and the seeds consequently escape predation. As a result the number of seeds lost to bruchid damage increases only marginally over time. Despite the levels of seed predation observed over the course of the study, the number of seeds in the soil seedbank almost doubled over time increasing from 8.5 seeds m−3 to 15.5 seeds m−3 over a 4-month period. Levels of seed predation and addition of seeds to the soil seedbank were not correlated. The taxonomic (subspecies) status and apparency of host plants as measured by plant and patch traits (average plant height, density of podding plants and patch size) did not influence levels of seed predation. Pre-dispersal seed predation studies need to take into account the pod/seed retention behaviour of the plant. The ability of the bruchid to regulate the invasiveness of Leucaena through influencing its demography is likely to be diminished if the insect populations cannot increase rapidly enough to use the seeds before pod dehiscence.

TI  - Acorn Crop, Seed Size and Chemical Defenses Determine the Performance of Specialized Insect Predators and Reproductive Output in a Mediterranean Oak.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Seed predation is an antagonistic interaction that negatively affects the performance of individual plants and can limit plant population dynamics. In animal-dispersed plants, crop size is an important determinant of plant reproductive success through its effect on seed dispersers and predators. Seed traits, such as size or chemical composition, can also increase the tolerance to seed predators or reduce their performance. We investigated the interaction between Quercus faginea and two specialized pre-dispersal insect seed predators (weevils and moths) during two years of contrasting crop size to determine the consequences of oak reproductive investment on seed production and insect performance. Crop size was 44% lower and acorns were 32% smaller in the second year, although acorn predation by insects was proportionally similar between both years at the population level. Individual trees producing larger crops showed a lower incidence of insect predators during the year of abundant acorn production, whereas trees producing bigger acorns experienced higher seed predation rates by insects, and acorns held more insect larvae in the low crop year. Competition between insects increased when acorn production was low, and higher tannin content in acorns further constrained the number of weevil larvae developing together in the same acorn. However, the abundance and size of insect larvae produced per tree were similar between the two crop years, and this was due to larvae often depleting acorn reserves when resources were low. Oak reproductive output increased nearly two-fold during the large crop year. Crop size variation, acorn production in a given year and acorn size and chemical composition seem to be important traits for reducing damage by insect predators in Quercus faginea and improve oak reproductive success.

TI  - Pre-dispersal seed predation in a species-rich forest community: Patterns and the interplay with determinants
PY  - 2015
AB  - Pre-dispersal seed predation (PDSP) is commonly observed in woody plants, and recognized as a driver of seed production variability that is critical for successful regeneration. Earlier studies on PDSP and its determinants were mostly species specific, with community-level PDSP rarely estimated; and the interactions between the temporal variability of seed production and PDSP remain elusive. In this study, the community seed rain of woody plants in a mixed evergreen-deciduous broadleaf forest was monitored for seven years. We examined predation on collected seeds and analyzed the determinants of PDSP. PDSP was recorded in 17 out of 44 woody plant species, and three-quarters of PDSP was due to insect predators. Annual seed production varied substantially at community level, reversely linked with the temporal variation of PDSP rate. The PDSP rate was biased regarding fruit types, and being significantly correlated with seed mass when using phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) or without taking into account phylogenetic relations, especially for nuts. PDSP rate was also negatively correlated with seed density, showing a threshold-related predator satiation effect. The community-level PDSP rate was primarily determined by tree height, fruit type, and interannual variation of seed production and seed mass. Our analysis revealed a causal link between seed production and the dynamics of PDSP rate at the community level. The predator satiation effect was primarily contributed by the dominant species, whereas the rare species seemed to apply a distinct “hide-and-seek” strategy to control the risk of PDSP. The mechanistic difference of seed production between the common and rare species can shed new light on species coexistence and community assembly. Long-term monitoring of both seed rain and seed predation is required for understanding the ecological and evolutionary implications of species regeneration strategies in a species-rich forest community.

TI  - Anticipatory reproduction and population growth in seed predators
PY  - 2006
AB  - Mast seeding, the intermittent, synchronous production of large seed crops by a population of plants, is a well-known example of resource pulses that create lagged responses in successive trophic levels of ecological communities. These lags arise because seed predators are thought capable of increasing reproduction and population size only after the resource pulse is available for consumption. The resulting satiation of predators is a widely cited explanation for the evolution of masting. Our study shows that both American and Eurasian tree squirrels anticipate resource pulses and increase reproductive output before a masting event, thereby increasing population size in synchrony with the resource pulse and eliminating the population lag thought to be universal in resource pulse systems.

TI  - Leftovers in seed dispersal: ecological implications of partial seed consumption for oak regeneration
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Successful seed dispersal by animals is assumed to occur when undamaged seeds arrive at a favourable microsite. Most seed removal and dispersal studies consider only two possible seed fates, predation or escape intact. Whether partial consumption of seeds has ecological implications for natural regeneration is unclear. We studied partial consumption of seeds in a rodent-dispersed oak species. 2. Fifteen percent of dispersed acorns were found partially eaten in a field experiment. Most damage affected only the basal portion of the seeds, resulting in no embryo damage. Partially eaten acorns had no differences in dispersal distance compared to intact acorns but were recovered at farther distances than completely consumed acorns. 3. Partially eaten acorns were found under shrub cover unlike intact acorns that were mostly dispersed to open microhabitats. 4. Partially eaten acorns were not found buried proportionally more often than intact acorns, leading to desiccation and exposure to biotic agents (predators, bacteria and fungi). However, partial consumption caused more rapid germination, which enables the acorns to tolerate the negative effects of exposure. 5. Re-caching and shrub cover as microhabitat of destination promote partial seed consumption. Larger acorns escaped predation more often and had higher uneaten cotyledon mass. Satiation at seed level is the most plausible explanation for partial consumption. 6. Partial consumption caused no differences in root biomass when acorns experienced only small cotyledon loss. However, root biomass was lower when acorns experienced heavy loss of tissue but, surprisingly, they produced longer roots, which allow the seeds to gain access sooner to deeper resources. 7. Synthesis. Partial consumption of acorns is an important event in the oak regeneration process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most acorns were damaged non-lethally, without decreasing both dispersal distances and the probability of successful establishment. Faster germination and production of longer roots allow partially eaten seeds to tolerate better the exposure disadvantages caused by the removal of the pericarp and the non-buried deposition. Consequently, partially consumed seeds can contribute significantly to natural regeneration and must be considered in future seed dispersal studies.

TI  - The evolutionary ecology of mast seeding in trees
PY  - 1980
AB  - The hypothesis that masting by trees is a defensive strategy which satiates seed predators in mast years and starves them in the intervening periods is tested in 59 sets of data on the seed production and pre-dispersal seed-predation of 25 tree species. Twenty-lour of the 59 data-sets support the hypothesis and show a statistically significant positive relationship between the proportion of seeds surviving the pre-dispersal stage and the log10 of the crop size for the same year. Evidence that pre-dispersal seed survival increases with the length of the mast interval is poor.



A positive relationship between the strength of the masting habit and the maxintum observed pre-dispersal seed mortality in a sample of 15 tree species suggests that the masting habit is best developed in predator-prone species. A survey of seed crop frequencies in the woody plant flora of Nortli America shows masting species to be under-represented amongst shrubs and amongst trees which disperse their seeds in fleshy dispersal units. The selection pressures and evolutionary constraints which operate on the evolution of masting plants and their seed predators are discussed.

TI  - The functional response of a hoarding seed predator to mast seeding
PY  - 2010
AB  - Mast seeding involves the episodic and synchronous production of large seed crops by perennial plants. The predator satiation hypothesis proposes that mast seeding maximizes seed escape because seed predators consume a decreasing proportion of available seeds with increasing seed production. However, the seed escape benefits of masting depend not only on whether predators are satiated at high levels of seed production, but also on the shape of their functional response (type II vs. type III), and the actual proportion of available seeds that they consume at different levels of seed production. North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are the primary vertebrate predator of white spruce (Picea glauca) mast seed crops in many boreal regions because they hoard unopened cones in underground locations, preempting the normal sequence of cone opening, seed dispersal, and seed germination. We document the functional response of cone-hoarding by red squirrels across three non-mast years and one mast year by estimating the number of cones present in the territories of individual red squirrels and the proportion of these cones that they hoarded each autumn. Even though red squirrels are not constrained by the ingestive and on-body (fat reserves) energy reserve limitations experienced by animals that consume seeds directly, most squirrels hoarded < 10% of the cones present on their territories under mast conditions. Cone availability during non-mast years also reached levels that satiated the hoarding activity of red squirrels; however, this occurred only on the highest-quality territories. Squirrels switched to mushroom-hoarding when cone production was low and mushrooms were abundant. This resulted in type III functional response whereby the proportional harvest of cones was highest at levels of cone availability that were intermediate within non-mast years. Overall, more cones escaped squirrel cone-hoarding during a mast event than when cone production was low in non-mast years, which supports the predator satiation hypothesis. However, the highly variable seed escape in non-mast years may help to explain why all spruce cone production is not concentrated into fewer, larger, mast years.

TI  - Advantages of masting in European beech: timing of granivore satiation and benefits of seed caching support the predator dispersal hypothesis
PY  - 2015
AB  - The predator satiation and predator dispersal hypotheses provide alternative explanations for masting. Both assume satiation of seed-eating vertebrates. They differ in whether satiation occurs before or after seed removal and caching by granivores (predator satiation and predator dispersal, respectively). This difference is largely unrecognized, but it is demographically important because cached seeds are dispersed and often have a microsite advantage over nondispersed seeds. We conducted rodent exclosure experiments in two mast and two nonmast years to test predictions of the predator dispersal hypothesis in our study system of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica). Specifically, we tested whether the fraction of seeds removed from the forest floor is similar during mast and nonmast years (i.e., lack of satiation before seed caching), whether masting decreases the removal of cached seeds (i.e., satiation after seed storage), and whether seed caching increases the probability of seedling emergence. We found that masting did not result in satiation at the seed removal stage. However, masting decreased the removal of cached seeds, and seed caching dramatically increased the probability of seedling emergence relative to noncached seeds. European beech thus benefits from masting through the satiation of scatterhoarders that occurs only after seeds are removed and cached. Although these findings do not exclude other evolutionary advantages of beech masting, they indicate that fitness benefits of masting extend beyond the most commonly considered advantages of predator satiation and increased pollination efficiency.

If plants with heat-stimulated germination are also subject to seed predation and display mast-seeding cycles, postfire recruitment may be contingent on the seedfall density of prefire masts, and on whether granivores are satiated at the time of fire.

AB  - Koenig, W. D., Kelly, D., Sork, V. L., Duncan, R. P., Elkinton, J. S., Peltonen, M. S. and Westfall, R. D. 2003. Dissecting components of population-level variation in seed production and the evolution of masting behavior. – Oikos 102: 581–591. Mast-fruiting or masting behavior is the cumulative result of the reproductive patterns of individuals within a population and thus involves components of individual variability, between-individual synchrony, and endogenous cycles of temporal autocorrelation. Extending prior work by Herrera, we explore the interrelationships of these components using data on individual seed production in 59 populations of plants from 24 species spanning a large range of annual variability, from species exhibiting strong masting to others with little annual variability in seed production. Estimates of population and individual variability were not biased by sample size or average overall seed production when based on untransformed seed production values, but these values declined as log-transformed seed production increased. Population variability was more strongly correlated with individual variability (r= 0.86) than individual synchrony (r=0.73). These latter two components were also significantly correlated (r=0.45), but randomizations confirm that they need not covary closely. Thus, selection can act separately on inter-annual variability and between-individual synchrony. We illustrate the potential for such fine-tuned selection on seed production patterns by discussing several examples and by demonstrating significant differences in components of population-level variation in seed production among species related to their life-history.

TI  - Seed removal and seed fate in Gustavia superba (Lecythidaceae).
PY  - 1992
AB  - The fate of the large (mean 12.6 g) seeds of Gustavia superba, an understory tree, was analyzed on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Eight hundred thread-marked seeds were placed on the ground at two contrasting 1-ha forest sites (Gustavia-rich vs Gustavia-poor) during two periods (June and July) of the fruiting season of G. superba. These months correspond to maximum food availability on BCI. On average, 85.5 percent of the seeds were removed within 28 days, 47.5 percent and 3.8 percent of them being found scatterhoarded (buried) by agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and gnawed by rodents, respectively, within 10 m of their origins. The effect of site and the interaction of site with month significantly affected seed removal rates, but not scatterhoarding rates. Proportions of seeds removed were greater where G. superba trees were rare. Because freshly fallen seeds were not infested by bruchid weevils, unburied and germinating seeds provide an abundant short-term food supply for terrestrial mammals. Burying seeds allowed agoutis to later consume cotyledons of germinating seeds from mid-August throughout October, when food is scarce on BCI. Overall seed dispersal effectiveness (% seed dispersal multiplied by % seedling survival) contrasts dramatically between forest sites, being 10.1 percent and 0.75 percent at Gustavia-rich and Gustavia-poor areas, respectively. This result suggests that predator-disperser satiation occurred, maybe due to greater G. superba seed availability and other alternative food supply, allowing greater G. superba seedling survival at the Gustavia-rich area.

TI  - Is the relationship between mast-seeding and weather in oaks related to their life-history or phylogeny?
PY  - 2016
AB  - Although the functional basis of variable and synchronous seed production (masting behavior) has been extensively investigated, only recently has attention been focused on the proximate mechanisms driving this phenomenon. We analyzed the relationship between weather and acorn production in 15 species of oaks (genus Quercus) from three geographic regions on two continents, with the goals of determining the extent to which similar sets of weather factors affect masting behavior across species and to explore the ecological basis for the similarities detected. Lag-1 temporal autocorrelations were predominantly negative, supporting the hypothesis that stored resources play a role in masting behavior across this genus, and we were able to determine environmental variables correlating with acorn production in all but one of the species. Standard weather variables outperformed “differential-cue” variables based on the difference between successive years in a majority of species, which is consistent with the hypothesis that weather is linked directly to the proximate mechanism driving seed production and that masting in these species is likely to be sensitive to climate change. Based on the correlations between weather variables and acorn production, cluster analysis failed to generate any obvious groups of species corresponding to phylogeny or life-history. Discriminant function analyses, however, were able to identify the phylogenetic section to which the species belonged and, controlling for phylogeny, the length of time species required to mature acorns, whether they were evergreen or deciduous, and, to a lesser extent, the geographic region to which they are endemic. These results indicate that similar proximate mechanisms are driving acorn production in these species of oaks, that the environmental factors driving seed production in oaks are to some extent phylogenetically conserved, and that the shared mechanisms driving acorn production result in some degree of synchrony among coexisting species in a way that potentially enhances predator satiation, at least when they have acorns requiring the same length of time to mature.

TI  - Acorn Production by Oaks in Central Coastal California: Variation within and among Years
PY  - 1994
AB  - We measured acorn production by individual oaks of five different species at Hastings Reservation in central coastal California between 1980 and 1991. Variation in acorn production was considerable both within and among years and was generally un- correlated between species. Compared to expected values, variance within years in the size of acorn crops was small, while variance among years was high. Crop failures occurred fairly frequently and large crops in successive years were observed, but no more than expected by chance. Individual trees masted at species-specific intervals, but these patterns did not result in regular masting cycles at the population level. We compared these patterns to predictions of four hypotheses for the evolution of seed production patterns. Observations did not support the hypotheses that production patterns track resource availability (the "resource matching" hypothesis) or that they have evolved to attract seed dispersers (the "seed dispersal" hypothesis). However, they are generally consistent with two additional hypotheses, that masting in these wind-pollinated species evolved because of a proportional increase in fertilization and seed set during mast years (the "wind pollination" hypothesis) and that masting has evolved to maximize the prob- ability of avoiding predation via predator satiation (the "predator satiation" hypothesis).

TI  - SEED MASS AND MAST SEEDING ENHANCE DISPERSAL BY A NEOTROPICAL SCATTER-HOARDING RODENT
PY  - 2004
AB  - Many tree species that depend on scatter-hoarding animals for seed dispersal produce massive crops of large seeds at irregular intervals. Mast seeding and large seed size in these species have been explained as adaptations to increase animal dispersal and reduce predation. We studied how seed size and seed abundance simultaneously influenced seed dispersal and predation by scatter-hoarding rodents in the large-seeded rain forest tree Carapa procera (Meliaceae) in French Guiana. We individually tracked the fates of 3000 seeds, using remote video monitoring and thread-marking. Seed size was manipulated by broadly varying intraspecific seed mass, whereas effects of seed abundance were examined by tracking seeds in three seed-rich years and two seed-poor years. The hypotheses, that seed mass and seed abundance both enhance dispersal success and that seed abundance reinforces the effect of seed mass, were supported by the results. Most seeds were removed by the scatter-hoarding rodent red acouchy (Myoprocta acouchy) and subsequently were buried in scattered, single-seeded caches up to distances >100 m. Seeds that were not removed failed to establish seedlings. Seed removal was slower, pre-removal seed predation was greater, and seed dispersal was less far in seed-rich years than in seed-poor years, suggesting poorer dispersal under seed abundance. However, this was more than counterbalanced by a disproportionally greater survival of cached seeds in seed-rich years. The per capita probability of seed survival and seedling establishment was at least 4½ times greater under seed abundance. Large seeds were removed faster, were more likely to be scatter-hoarded, and were dispersed farther away than smaller ones, resulting in a higher probability of seedling establishment for larger seeds. Size discrimination was greater under seed abundance, albeit only during seed removal. Overall, large seeds shed in rich years had the highest probability of seedling establishment. Hence, both larger seed size and greater seed abundance stimulate rodents to act more as dispersers and less as predators of seeds. We conclude that scatter-hoarding rodents can select for both large seed crops and large seeds, which may reinforce mast seeding.

TI  - Impacts of logging on density-dependent predation of dipterocarp seeds in a South East Asian rainforest
PY  - 2011
AB  - Much of the forest remaining in South East Asia has been selectively logged. The processes promoting species coexistence may be the key to the recovery and maintenance of diversity in these forests. One such process is the Janzen–Connell mechanism, where specialized natural enemies such as seed predators maintain diversity by inhibiting regeneration near conspecifics. In Neotropical forests, anthropogenic disturbance can disrupt the Janzen–Connell mechanism, but similar data are unavailable for South East Asia. We investigated the effects of conspecific density (two spatial scales) and distance from fruiting trees on seed and seedling survival of the canopy tree Parashorea malaanonan in unlogged and logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia. The production of mature seeds was higher in unlogged forest, perhaps because high adult densities facilitate pollination or satiate pre-dispersal predators. In both forest types, post-dispersal survival was reduced by small-scale (1 m2) conspecific density, but not by proximity to the nearest fruiting tree. Large-scale conspecific density (seeds per fruiting tree) reduced predation, probably by satiating predators. Higher seed production in unlogged forest, in combination with slightly higher survival, meant that recruitment was almost entirely limited to unlogged forest. Thus, while logging might not affect the Janzen–Connell mechanism at this site, it may influence the recruitment of particular species.

TI  - Nut density and removal in Syagrus loefgrenii Glassman (Arecaceae) in the Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2016
AB  - In this study, I tested the effect of Syagrus loefgrenii nut number on the removal intensity by rodents across seasons. Also, I assessed both S. loefgrenii fruit production, and dispersion pattern to analyze the relationship between these parameters and nut removal. Trials were performed (autumn, winter, spring, and summer), in which endocarps were placed inside trays (5, 15, and 40 endocarps) in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). Syagrus loefgrenii exhibited clumped distribution, although its local density had no correlation with endocarp removal rate. Despite of variations, S. loefgrenii fruit production had no seasonal difference, although, high proportions of endocarps were year round removed. This mostly results from nearly complete endocarp loss in depots of 5 and 15, while the opposite occurred in those of 40. Hence, the intensity of removal consistently decreases with endocarp number, so that endocarp removal conformed to negative distance-dependence. As this palm exhibit clumped distribution and, in principle, fruit asynchronously, if, at least, a group of neighboring stems bore fruits simultaneously, an enhanced number of nuts might be available at a given site. Therefore, seeds within a dense S. loefgrenii fruit patch might experience high survival rates due to satiation of post dispersal seed predators.

TI  - Crop damage of Eriotheca gracilipes (Bombacaceae) by the Blue-Fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva, Psittacidae), in the Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2014
AB  - Seed predation has major effects on the reproductive success of individuals, spatial patterns of populations, genetic variability, interspecific interactions and ultimately in the diversity of tree communities. At a Brazilian savanna, I evaluated the proportional crop loss of Eriotheca gracilipes due the Blue-Fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) during a fruiting period. Also, I analyzed the relationship between proportional crop loss to Amazons and both fruit crop size and the distance from the nearest damaged conspecific. Trees produced from 1 to 109 fruits, so that Amazons foraged more often on trees bearing larger fruit crop size, while seldom visited less productive trees. Moreover, the relationship between fruit crop sizes and the number of depredated fruits was significant. However, when only damaged trees were assessed, I found a negative and significant relation between fruit crop size and proportional crop loss to Blue-Fronted Amazons. Taking into account this as a measure more directly related to the probability of seed survival, a negative density dependent effect emerged. Also, Amazons similarly damaged the fruit crops of either close or distant neighboring damaged trees. Hence, in spite of Blue-Fronted Amazons searched for E. gracilipes bearing large fruit crops, they were swamped due to the presence of more fruits than they could eat. Moderate seed predation by Blue-Fronted Amazons either at trees with large fruit crops or in areas where fruiting trees were aggregated implies in an enhanced probability of E. gracilipes seed survival and consequent regeneration success.

TI  - Genetic variation in flowering phenology and avoidance of seed predation in native populations of Ulex europaeus
PY  - 2009
AB  - The genetic variation in flowering phenology may be an important component of a species' capacity to colonize new environments. In native populations of the invasive species Ulex europaeus, flowering phenology has been shown to be bimodal and related to seed predation. The aim of the present study was to determine if this bimodality has a genetic basis, and to investigate whether the polymorphism in flowering phenology is genetically linked to seed predation, pod production and growth patterns. We set up an experiment raising maternal families in a common garden. Based on mixed analyses of variance and correlations among maternal family means, we found genetic differences between the two main flowering types and confirmed that they reduced seed predation in two different ways: escape in time or predator satiation. We suggest that this polymorphism in strategy may facilitate maintain high genetic diversity for flowering phenology and related life-history traits in native populations of this species, hence providing high evolutionary potential for these traits in invaded areas.

TI  - Patterns of mast fruiting of common beech, sessile and common oak, Norway spruce and Scots pine in Central and Northern Europe
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Occurrence of mast years, i.e. the synchronous production of vast amounts of fruits or seeds, has an important impact on forest ecosystems, their functioning and their services. We investigated the mast patterns of the forest tree species common beech, common and sessile oak, Norway spruce and Scots pine in Central and Northern Europe over the last two to three decades. We analysed data from the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests) and additional Danish, German, Flemish and Swiss datasets. Within-plot synchrony of fructification intensity in individual trees was high in beech and spruce and lower in oak species and pine. Mast frequency increased in most regions for beech, whereas the other species showed mixed or no trends. Beech, oak species and spruce showed strong mast year (MY) synchrony, but pine did not. MY synchrony between species was only significant in Bavaria, in Switzerland and between beech, oak species and spruce in Denmark. The deciduous species showed bimodal normal masting, while the conifers had switching normal masting. Oak species and the conifers supported the large seed and the accessory costs hypotheses, and beech and spruce supported the economy of scale, predator satiation and resource allocation hypotheses.

TI  - Population Fluctuations of Mast-Eating Rodents Are Correlated with Production of Acorns
PY  - 1996
AB  - I used a 14-year dataset on dynamics of mast-consuming rodents from an eastern deciduous forest to determine the relationship between population fluctuations of white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ), deer mice ( P. maniculatus ), and eastern chipmunks ( Tamias stria-tus ) and production of acorn mast. Mast (acorn) production was episodic with four excellent crops produced in 14 years. Densities of rodents in summer ranged from 3 to 103 animals/ha and correlated positively with production of mast the previous autumn (all r 2 > 0.56). During years of high production of mast, stores of acorn lasted throughout winter, whereas in most years, acorns were gone by January. During years of high production of mast, mice bred all winter, which resulted in high densities the following summer. Episodic production of mast and resulting fluctuations in consumers of mast have implications for the predator-satiation hypothesis and other community processes.

TI  - CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MAST SEED PRODUCTION OF FOUR CO‐OCCURRING CARPINUS SPECIES IN JAPAN
PY  - 1998
AB  - To test two hypotheses for mast fruiting, i.e., (1) pollination efficiency and (2) pre-dispersal predator satiation, we investigated annual fluctuation in seed production and demography from flower to seed of four Carpinus species (family Betulaceae). We monitored flowering, seed production, and seed fall for seven years (1987-1993) for Car- pinus laxiflora, C. tschonoskii, C. japonica, and C. cordata, which co-occur in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. We also monitored the seasonal development of pistillate aments in 1995. These Carpinus species are known to show highly synchronized, fluctuating annual seed production. Total seed production (the sum of sound seeds, seeds suffering predation, empty seeds, and immature seeds) was proportional to the quantity of staminate aments and was synchronized among the four species during the observation period. The percentage of mature seeds (the sum of sound seeds and seeds suffering predation) out of the total seed production was positively correlated with annual staminate ament production. This result supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The observation that most ovaries in this study did not fall after the pollination season and grew into normal, mature-sized seeds irrespective of fertilization (empty or not) also sup- ports the hypothesis. The percentage of seeds suffering predation by insects significantly decreased in relation to sound seed production, suggesting that predator satiation also operated for these Carpinus species. If the four species have common seed predators (pos- sibly some curculionid species), mutually synchronized fluctuation of seed production among them would be effective for escaping from pre-dispersal predation.

TI  - The effect of conspecific density, herbivory, and bamboo on seedling dynamics of a dominant oak in a Neotropical highland forest
PY  - 2019
AB  - Conspecific negative density-dependence (CNDD) is one of the main mechanisms proposed to regulate species coexistence. Tropical highland forests, in contrast to diverse lowland forests, are commonly dominated by a few tree species. Testing the importance of density-dependence effects on seedling establishment of dominant trees may provide insights on the mechanisms regulating population dynamics and forest composition of tropical highlands. We tested the importance of CNDD regulation on seedling survival and recruitment of Quercus costaricensis, a monodominant oak in the Talamanca highland forests of Costa Rica. We used spatial statistics and generalized linear mixed models to test the effects of conspecific density, distance to the nearest adult, density of Chusquea bamboo shoots, and herbivory on the annual survival probability of 3538 seedlings between 2014 and 2017. We did not find any effect of CNDD on seedling survival. However, bamboo density and herbivory both significantly decreased seedling survival. All seedlings had signs of herbivory and predator satiation may explain the lack of density dependent regulation in this species. We argue that the lack of intraspecific density regulation at the seedling stage may explain the dominance of Q. costaricensis in the highland forests of Costa Rica. Local density of this endemic oak is instead regulated by herbivory and the density of Chusquea.

TI  - LIMITED DISPERSAL AND HETEROGENEOUS PREDATION RISK SYNERGISTICALLY ENHANCE PERSISTENCE OF RARE PREY
PY  - 2005
AB  - White-footed mice prey on gypsy moth pupae while foraging for other, more abundant food. Mice appear capable of locally extirpating moths since mice exert high predation pressure on sparse pupae and are numerically decoupled from moth populations. Nevertheless, during 23 years of monitoring, moths persisted at scales .1 ha despite fre- quent extinctions at smaller spatial scales. We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous intensity in mouse foraging and/or limited moth dispersal might allow moth persistence. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based, empirically parameterized model, we show that neither spatially heterogeneous predation by mice, nor limited moth dispersal alone allows moth persistence at typical mouse densities. However, synergy between both factors allows moth population persistence at naturally occurring mouse densities. For example, in models with 40 mice/ha, both limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal had a 0% chance of moth persistence, but the combination of limited dispersal and heterogeneous predation risk resulted in a ;75% chance of moth persistence. Furthermore, both for limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and for spatially heterogeneous pre- dation risk with unlimited moth dispersal, moth persistence was only guaranteed at very low mouse densities, while the combination of limited moth dispersal with heterogeneous predation guaranteed moth persistence within a broad range of mouse densities. The findings illustrate a novel mechanism of ''spatial selection and satiation'' that can enhance rare species persistence under intense incidental predation by generalist predators.

TI  - Tropical-temperate comparisons in insect seed predation vary between study levels and years.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The biotic interaction hypothesis, which states the species interaction becomes stronger in the tropics, is deeply rooted in classic ecological literature and widely accepted to contribute to the latitudinal gradients of biodiversity. Tests in latitudinal insect-plant interaction have emphasized leaf-eating insects on a single or a few plant species rather than within an entire community and mixed accumulating evidence, leaving the biotic interaction hypothesis disputed. We aimed to test the hypothesis by quantifying insect seed predation in a pair of tropical and temperate forest communities with similar elevations. We applied a consistent study design to sample predispersal seeds with systematically set seed traps in 2019-2020 and examined internally feeding insects. The intensity of seed predation was measured and further applied to tropical versus temperate comparison at two levels (cross-species and community-wide). Our results showed every latitudinal pattern associated with different study levels and years, that is, negative (greater granivory in the tropics in community-wide comparison in 2020), positive (less granivory in the tropics in community-wide and cross-species comparison in 2019), and missing (similar level of granivory in the tropics in cross-species comparisons in 2020). The cross-species level analyses ignore differences among species in seed production and weaken or even lose the latitudinal trend detected by community-wide comparisons. The between-year discrepancy in tropical-temperate comparisons relates to the highly variable annual seed composition in the temperate forest due to mast seeding of dominant species. Our study highlights that long-term community-level researches across biomes are essential to assess the latitudinal biotic interaction hypothesis.

TI  - Global patterns in the predator satiation effect of masting: A meta-analysis.
PY  - 2022
AB  - SignificanceMasting, or synchronous production of large seed crops, is widespread among plants. The predator satiation hypothesis states that masting evolved to overwhelm seed predators with an excess of food. Yet, this popular explanation faced few rigorous tests. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that related the magnitude of seed production to the intensity of seed predation. Our results validate certain theoretical notions (e.g., that predator satiation is more effective at higher latitudes) but challenge others (e.g., that specialist and generalist consumers differ in the type of functional response to masting). We also found that masting is losing its ability to satiate consumers, probably because global warming affected masting patterns. This shift might considerably impair the reproduction of masting plants.

 Several hypotheses have been proposed concerning the adaptive advantages of
 mast-fruiting (Janzen 1971, 1974; Kelly 1994), and some field observations have
 provided evidence for these hypotheses (Norton & Kelly 1988, Shibata et al. 1998, Sork 1993). The predator-satiation hypothesis is one well-known explanation for reproductive synchrony in plants and animals (Janzen 1971, 1974; Kelly
 1994). This hypothesis claims that mast fruiting at irregular intervals of several
 years is an effective means of satiating vertebrate fruit predators: low seed
 production can only support low densities of predators during the periods
 between mast-fruiting events, but more fruits are produced than predators can
 consume in masting years (Janzen 1971, Kelly 1994). Thus, it may be said that
 mast-fruiting is a defence strategy of plants against post-dispersal vertebrate
 fruit predators.

TI  - Empty seeds are not always bad: simultaneous effect of seed emptiness and masting on animal seed predation.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Seed masting and production of empty seeds have often been considered independently as different strategies to reduce seed predation by animals. Here, we integrate both phenomena within the whole assemblage of seed predators (both pre and post-dispersal) and in two contrasting microsites (open vs. sheltered) to improve our understanding of the factors controlling seed predation in a wind-dispersed tree (Ulmus laevis). In years with larger crop sizes more avian seed predators were attracted with an increase in the proportion of full seeds predated on the ground. However, for abundant crops, the presence of empty seeds decreased the proportion of full seeds predated. Empty seeds remained for a very long period in the tree, making location of full seeds more difficult for pre-dispersal predators and expanding the overall seed drop period at a very low cost (in dry biomass and allocation of C, N and P). Parthenocarpy (non-fertilized seeds) was the main cause of seed emptiness whereas seed abortion was produced in low quantity. These aborted seeds fell prematurely and, thus, could not work as deceptive seeds. A proportion of 50% empty seeds significantly reduced ground seed predation by 26%. However, a high rate of parthenocarpy (beyond 50% empty seeds) did not significantly reduce seed predation in comparison to 50% empty seeds. We also found a high variability and unpredictability in the production of empty seeds, both at tree and population level, making predator deception more effective. Open areas were especially important to facilitate seed survival since rodents (the main post-dispersal predators) consumed seeds mostly under shrub cover. In elm trees parthenocarpy is a common event that might work as an adaptive strategy to reduce seed predation. Masting per se did not apparently reduce the overall proportion of seeds predated in this wind-dispersed tree, but kept great numbers of seeds unconsumed.

TI  - Differential Predation on Metamorphic Anurans by Garter Snakes (Thamnophis): Social Behavior as a Possible Defense
PY  - 1978
AB  - The diets of garter snakes (Thamnophis) collected at several localities were examined and the developmental stage of anurans in the diets were recorded. During periods of anuran metamorphosis, garter snakes converge on the shoreline and their diets are biased towards transforming stages. This bias appears to reflect the locomotor ineptitude of metamophosing anurans;a transforming anurans can neither swim nor hop as effectively as premetamorphic tadpoles or postmetamorphic frogs, respectively. Metamorphic synchrony in certain anurans (e.g., Bufo) may have evolved as a defense against predation during metamorphosis. This synchrony could satiate predators. Certain anurans (e.g., Bufo, Scaphiophus) form postmetamorphic aggregations which may represent `selfish herds' in which individuals gain protection by association with more vulnerable conspecifics.

TI  - Biotic and abiotic drivers of dipterocarp seedling survival following mast fruiting in Malaysian Borneo
PY  - 2014
AB  - South-East Asian tropical rain forests experience sporadic, but profuse, seed production after general flowering, leading to the synchronous emergence of various seedlings and subsequent seedling dynamics, which play a crucial role in determining species distribution and coexistence. We examined the relative importance of both biotic (initial height, conspecific seedling density) and abiotic (canopy openness, per cent sand, soil water content) drivers using survival data for 1842 seedlings of 12 dipterocarp species for 1.5 y following mast fruiting in an old-growth Bornean tropical rain forest. More than 30% of all dipterocarp seedlings survived 1.5 y after mast fruiting. When all species were analysed together, we found that initial seedling height, canopy openness and conspecific seedling density affected dipterocarp seedling survival. Negative density dependence indicated that predators were not satiated, but dipterocarp seedlings rather suffered from host-specific natural enemies or intraspecific competition. Species-level analyses of seven dipterocarp species showed large variation in response to biotic and abiotic factors. These results suggest that interspecific differences in the relative importance of biotic and abiotic effects on seedling survival might contribute to species coexistence.

TI  - Both seedling banks and specialist seed predators promote the evolution of synchronized and intermittent reproduction (masting) in trees
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary


1. Conditions leading to the evolution of masting (intermittent and synchronized reproduction of trees) are examined. According to the dynamics of the resource reserve of individuals, reproductive investment is the proportion of investment in flowers with coefficient k. If k evolves to sufficiently large values, trees show a large between-year fluctuation in the seed crop even in a constant environment (masting).



2. Our assumptions are: the forest consists of many sites, each occupied by a single canopy tree. After a canopy tree falls, the vacant site (gap) becomes available for recruitment.



3. Masting never evolves if all vacant sites are filled by individuals from seeds produced in the same year, despite the fact that trees reproducing intermittently enjoy a higher pollination success than trees reproducing annually.



4. Masting can evolve if some seedlings survive for several years, forming a seedling bank on the forest floor, where seeds produced in different years compete for gap acquisition. In this case, the disadvantage of intermittent reproduction is compensated for by seedlings and the benefit of pollen limitation dominates.



5. We also study the effect of specialist seed predators. In the complete absence of seed bank or seeding bank, masting never evolves even in the presence of seed predators. If some seedlings survive for multiple years, seed predators can promote the evolution of masting.



6. Synthesis. Both seedling banks and specialist seed predators promote the evolution of masting. However, the presence of seed predators can work only when some seedlings can survive more than 1 year. The regeneration process of forests must be considered when the evolution of the reproduction of plants is discussed.

TI  - Between-Site Differences in the Scale of Dispersal and Gene Flow in Red Oak
PY  - 2012
AB  - BACKGROUND Nut-bearing trees, including oaks (Quercus spp.), are considered to be highly dispersal limited, leading to concerns about their ability to colonize new sites or migrate in response to climate change. However, estimating seed dispersal is challenging in species that are secondarily dispersed by animals, and differences in disperser abundance or behavior could lead to large spatio-temporal variation in dispersal ability. Parentage and dispersal analyses combining genetic and ecological data provide accurate estimates of current dispersal, while spatial genetic structure (SGS) can shed light on past patterns of dispersal and establishment. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS In this study, we estimate seed and pollen dispersal and parentage for two mixed-species red oak populations using a hierarchical bayesian approach. We compare these results to those of a genetic ML parentage model. We also test whether observed patterns of SGS in three size cohorts are consistent with known site history and current dispersal patterns. We find that, while pollen dispersal is extensive at both sites, the scale of seed dispersal differs substantially. Parentage results differ between models due to additional data included in bayesian model and differing genotyping error assumptions, but both indicate between-site dispersal differences. Patterns of SGS in large adults, small adults, and seedlings are consistent with known site history (farmed vs. selectively harvested), and with long-term differences in seed dispersal. This difference is consistent with predator/disperser satiation due to higher acorn production at the low-dispersal site. While this site-to-site variation results in substantial differences in asymptotic spread rates, dispersal for both sites is substantially lower than required to track latitudinal temperature shifts. CONCLUSIONS Animal-dispersed trees can exhibit considerable spatial variation in seed dispersal, although patterns may be surprisingly constant over time. However, even under favorable conditions, migration in heavy-seeded species is likely to lag contemporary climate change.

TI  - Density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation and fruit set in a tropical tree.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Negative density-dependent demographic processes operating at post-dispersal seed, seedling, and juvenile stages are the dominant explanation for the coexistence of high numbers of tree species in tropical forests. At adult stages, the effect of pollinators and pre-dispersal fruit predators are often dependent on the density or abundance of flowers and fruit in the canopy, but each have opposite effects on individual realized reproduction. We studied the effect of density on total and mature fruit set and pre-dispersal predation rates within individual tree canopies in a common canopy tree species, Jacaranda copaia in a 50-ha forest census plot in central Panama. We sampled all reproductive sized trees in the plot (n = 188) across three years and estimated fruit set and predation rates. Population-wide pre-dispersal seed predation averaged between 6-37% across years. Using linear mixed effects models, we found that increased density and fecundity of conspecific neighbours increased focal tree fruit set, but also the rate of pre-dispersal predation. An interaction between individual and neighbourhood fruit production predicted lower predation rates at high individual and neighbourhood fecundities, which suggests predator satiation at high fruit abundance levels. However, the rate at which fruit set increased with conspecific neighbour fruit production was greater than the rate at which fruit were lost to predation, resulting in an overall positive effect of neighbour density on mature fruit production in focal trees. Our results run counter to the expectation of a uniformly negative effect of density across all life stages in tropical trees and suggest further exploration of the role of spatial clumping, pollen dispersal limitation, and predation at pre-dispersal adult stages in maintenance of species diversity in plant communities.

TI  - Socially induced reproductive synchrony in a salmonid: an approximate Bayesian computation approach
PY  - 2016
AB  - Reproductive synchrony is a widespread phenomenon found in many taxa, including plants and corals. However, compared with synchrony caused by environmental cues, knowledge of socially induced reproductive synchrony is limited, partly due to the difficulty of experimentally manipulating and/or making detailed behavioral observations of populations in the wild. In this study, we developed a novel modeling framework combining an individual-based model, a hierarchical Bayesian model, and an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to elucidate socially induced reproductive synchrony. This method was applied to time-series redd (i.e., spawning nests) count data in 30 wild populations of stream-dwelling Dolly Varden charr. The model with reproductive synchrony explained all the redd count data, whereas the null model, which did not include the synchrony, failed to reproduce the observed data in several populations. In addition, our models suggest that Dolly Varden should be able to adjust spawning by up to a week following other females to produce synchrony. No significant correlation was observed between reproductive timing and environmental factors, suggesting that the major cue for the synchrony was social rather than environmental. The presence of reproductive synchrony within but not among local populations suggests that predator satiation is not the main driver of the synchrony; rather, other mechanisms must exist in the Dolly Varden, such as induced monogamy or polygamy, or avoidance of nest superimposition. This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of using individual-based and hierarchical modeling together with an ABC parameter estimation method in behavioral ecological studies.

TI  - Ecology of mast-fruiting in three species of North American deciduous oaks.
PY  - 1993
AB  - We conducted an 8—yr study of flower and acorn production in three species of oak in east—central Missouri: white oak (Quercus alba), red oak (Q. rubra), and Black oak (Q. velutina). The goal was to evaluate whether mast—fruiting, the synchronous production of large seed crops followed by small seed crops, is simply a response to weather conditions or is actually an evolved reproductive strategy. In this paper, we address four specific questions: (1) Are annual fluctuations in acorn crop size the result of synchronous production of acorns by individuals? (2) Are large acorn crops the result of large flower crops and/or high survival of those flowers to mature fruit? (3) To what extent do weather variables account for variation in acorn production among years? (4) Does acorn crop size correlate negatively with prior acorn production? Red oak and white oak showed a greater degree of mast—fruiting than did black oak. Within a species, individuals tended to produce large acorn crops in the same years, but each species differed in which years they produced large crops. The size of a given acorn crop was determined by both flower abundance and survival of flowers to fruit. Principal components and multiple—regression analyses were used to describe the relationship between weather variables and acorn production. The first principal component explained the largest amount of the variation in black oak (R2 = 0.55) and the red oak (R2 = 0.89). In white oak, two principal components combined to explain 77% of the variation in acorn production. The weather variables that were associated with these principal components included spring temperature (positive effect) and summer drought (negative effect). Past acorn production had a major impact on the size of the current acorn crop, with each species showing a different pattern. In black oak, the current acorn crop was negatively correlated with the crop 3 yr prior but positively correlated with the crop 2 yr prior. In red oak, acorn crop size 1, 2, and 3 yr prior had negative correlations with current acorn crop, while acorn crop size 4 yr prior was positively correlated. In white oak, there were negative correlations between acorn crop size and crop size 1, 2, and 4 yr prior but a positive correlation with the acorn crop size 3 yr prior. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast—fruiting species must store resources during some years in order to produce a mast crop. We discuss the possibility that these three species may have inherent cycles of reproduction that are modified by the impact of weather conditions, black oak with 2—yr cycles, white oak with 3—yr cycles, and red oak with 4—yr cycles. We conclude that the patterns of acorn production for black oak, red oak, and white oak are not simply responses to weather events but are also a function of prior reproductive events. This suggests that masting is an evolved reproductive strategy.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Masting, the spatial synchronization of interannual variation in seed production, can enhance reproductive efficiency through positive density‐dependent processes (DD) that result in economies of scale (EOS), such as decreased pollen limitation and predator satiation in years of high reproduction.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>While the general occurrence of such EOS effects has been documented for masting species, few studies simultaneously investigated how spatial and temporal variation in reproduction affects pollination and predation. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the same mechanisms apply to co‐occurring species with different levels of conspecific density, pollen limitation, and seed defences.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we use a long‐term dataset with high spatial resolution of seed production of European beech (<jats:italic>Fagus sylvatica</jats:italic>), Norway spruce (<jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic>), and silver fir (<jats:italic>Abies alba</jats:italic>) in a primeval montane forest to investigate the relationship between reproductive effort, pollination efficiency and predispersal predation by insects.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that, along the temporal axis, the proportion of sound (fertilized and unpredated) seeds correlated positively with annual seed production over the 14‐year study period in all three species, most strongly in beech and only weakly in silver fir. Moreover, the results show that in beech, spatial seed density interacts with plot‐wide annual seed rain to enhance DD effects on seed predation, suggesting additive effects of synchronous reproduction on fitness benefits.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>: For both pollination and predispersal predation in beech and spruce, the strongest DD effects occur at low levels of reproduction and quickly reach asymptotes at higher levels, suggesting the presence of thresholds in different EOS mechanisms. As variability and synchrony in mast‐seeding are expected to decline with climate change, EOS effects driven by DD may remain stable until the threshold is reached, at which sudden declines would result in devastating effects on the availability of viable seeds for germination and recruitment.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Density- and distance-dependent seedling survival in a ballistically dispersed subtropical tree species Philenoptera sutherlandii
PY  - 2008
AB  - We examine the density- and distance-dependent seedling survival of Philenoptera sutherlandii, a common pod-bearing and dehiscent legume (Fabaceae) in Ongoye Forest, South Africa. Short-range ballistic dispersal causes seed to fall beneath the parent tree, where density- or distance-dependent mortality effects are expected to be concentrated. One hundred and eighty marked seedlings were monitored in a 0.5-ha plot containing 30 adults. Our survival data do not support the escape hypothesis. Predation levels declined with increasing seedling density (positive density-dependent survival), but seedling survival after 15 mo was not distance-dependent. Nevertheless, a unimodal (hump-shaped) recruitment curve, typically associated with decreasing seedling density and increasing seedling survival with distance, was observed. In the context of ballistic dispersal, this recruitment curve may indicate a hump-shaped dispersal kernel with predator satiation at high seedling densities near a parent tree. This recruitment curve likely arises because generalized insect seedling predators while attracted to the adult trees also tend to forage farther away. Short dispersal distances, in turn generate the high densities needed to satiate seed and seedling predators. Predator satiation results in long-term survival rates in P. sutherlandii similar to more widely dispersed and less common tree species.

TI  - Population dynamics of the shrub Acacia suaveolens (Sm.) Willd.: Seed production and predispersal seed predation
PY  - 1986
AB  - Seed production and predispersal seed predation in the shrub Acacia suaveolens were examined over 3 consecutive years in eight populations in south-eastern Australia. Seed-crop sizes varied both between and within populations of different ages. Seed production was maximal in the first one to four flowering seasons after establishment, and then declined with plant age. The size of the annual seed-crop was also influenced by rainfall for that year.



Predispersal seed predation varies between populations over fruiting seasons with the initial large seed-crops resulting in predator satiation. Within one fruiting season, no significant variation in the extent of predispersal seed predation was found in any of three populations studied. There were two major forms of predispersal seed loss: toss of whole fruits to Melanterius corosus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and external insect seed grazers, and loss of individual seeds within fruits to M. corosus. Exclusion experiments showed that seeds lost to these predispersal seed predators would otherwise have been matured by the parent plant. The effects of predispersal seed predation cannot be directly related to seedling recruitment. Indirectly, such predation may influence the dispersion of seeds in the soil profile and hence, subsequent recruitment.

TI  - Pollen limitation as a main driver of fruiting dynamics in oak populations
PY  - 2018
AB  - In many perennial wind-pollinated plants, the dynamics of seed production is commonly known to be highly fluctuating from year to year and synchronised among individuals within populations. The proximate causes of such seeding dynamics, called masting, are still poorly understood in oak species that are widespread in the northern hemisphere, and whose fruiting dynamics dramatically impacts forest regeneration and biodiversity. Combining long-term surveys of oak airborne pollen amount and acorn production over large-scale field networks in temperate areas, and a mechanistic modelling approach, we found that the pollen dynamics is the key driver of oak masting. Mechanisms at play involved both internal resource allocation to pollen production synchronised among trees and spring weather conditions affecting the amount of airborne pollen available for reproduction. The sensitivity of airborne pollen to weather conditions might make oak masting and its ecological consequences highly sensitive to climate change.

TI  - Cumulative satiation of a seed predator over the fruiting season of its host.
PY  - 1990
AB  - Late seed crops of the palm, Scheelea zonensis, escape predation by the bruchid beetle, Caryobruchus giganteus, in tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The beetle oviposits on the endocarp of the palm, and larval development takes place within the seed which is invariably killed. The intensity of oviposition is relatively high early and during the peak of the fruiting season and declines to zero while 20% of the palms are still ripening fruit. The life history of C. giganteus may contribute to the escape of late seed crops. Larval development takes longer than the fruiting season of the palm. As a result, there is just one generation of adult beetles each year, and their numbers are greatest at the beginning of the fruiting season of the host.

TI  - Biology of insects that feed in the inflorescences of Chionochloa (Poaceae) in New Zealand and their relevance to mast seeding
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Inflorescences of New Zealand Chionochloa species are attacked by at least three insects, two flies and a moth. There has been disagreement about the identity of various life stages of these insects. We followed the seasonal pattern of occurrence of the two fly species that fed in Chionochloa pallens inflorescences in a population on Mt Hutt, Canterbury. Eggs and larvae of Diplotoxa similis (Diptera: Chloropidae) appeared in the inflorescences as soon as they emerged. The larvae are principally flower feeders, and most D. similis individuals had pupated by the end of the flowering period. Diplotoxa similis adults emerged from the puparia at the end of the season, and probably overwintered as adults. The second fly was an undescribed cecidomyiid (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Eggs of the cecidomyiid are laid into the C. pallens florets at the time of flowering, and hatch into mobile, translucent, early‐instar larvae. Late‐instar larvae were less mobile and opaque orange, and probably dropped from the i...

TI  - Demographic consequences of heterogeneity in conspecific density dependence among mast-fruiting tropical trees
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>
            The role of conspecific density dependence (CDD) in the maintenance of species richness is a central focus of tropical forest ecology. However, tests of CDD often ignore the integrated effects of CDD over multiple life stages and their long-term impacts on population demography. We combined a 10-year time series of seed production, seedling recruitment and sapling and tree demography of three dominant Southeast Asian tree species that adopt a mast-fruiting phenology. We used these data to construct individual-based models that examine the effects of CDD on population growth rates (
            <jats:italic>λ</jats:italic>
            ) across life-history stages. Recruitment was driven by positive CDD for all species, supporting the predator satiation hypothesis, while negative CDD affected seedling and sapling growth of two species, significantly reducing

This negative CDD on juvenile growth overshadowed the positive CDD of recruitment, suggesting the cumulative effects of CDD during seedling and sapling development has greater importance than the positive CDD during infrequent masting events. Overall, CDD varied among positive, neutral and negative effects across life-history stages for all species, suggesting that assessments of CDD on transitions between just two stages (e.g. seeds seedlings or juveniles mature trees) probably misrepresent the importance of CDD on population growth and stability.

TI  - Food Preference as a Function of Resource Abundance with Multiple Prey Types: An Experimental Analysis of Optimal Foraging Theory
PY  - 1982
AB  - Data were collected on the response of a small population of folivores (Kerodon rupestris: Caviidae) to changes in the absolute abundance of 10 different species of leaves. When absolute abundances were tripled (relative abundances were held constant) the folivore population significantly altered its proportional consumption of food types. In general, preferred foods were consumed in greater relative proportions when abundance was increased and the relative utilization of less preferred foods declined. Otherwise, our results were problematic in relation to the assumptions and predictions of the energy maximization model of optimal foraging theory. First, not all foods of low rank decreased in consumption when we increased the abundance of high-ranked foods. The partial consumption of low-ranked foods (or partial preferences as referred to in the literature) is contrary to the tenets of energy maximization. Second, preferences did not remain consistent from phase to phase. In fact, ranks shifted considerably, especially with respect to high-ranked foods. A number of factors may have been responsible for these contradictions to optimal foraging theory. Folivores may represent an example of the special case of optimal foraging with nutrient constraints (Pulliam 1980). The partial consumption of low-ranked foods would then be expected in this situation. Also, the encounter rate for a given item or type is probably not constant in time or space; the rate of encounter is an ephemeral value, affected by an animal's degree of satiation, and dependent upon its degree of familiarity with the distribution of food items within its foraging area. This suggests that animals are optimal foragers, sensu Charnov, only in the short term. The probability of accepting an item when it is encountered will be either zero or one in the short term, but in the long term (hours, days, seasons, years) it will assume an average value between zero and one. Finally, consumers should evolve search images for types or species, when within-type variability is very small and overlap among types minimal. When within-type variability is large, and distributions of food value overlap a great deal, natural selection should favor consumers that select high value items and do not generalize on a type's average values. We present a scenario which proposes that feeding habits may influence the way a consumer optimizes its foraging behavior. Empirical tests of optimal foraging models based upon energy maximization have upheld theoretical predictions when predators were presented with limited prey choices (e.g., Goss-Custard 1977; Krebs et al. 1977). Tests which have examined more complex situations (Zach and Smith 1980; this paper) suggest that models which include considerations of nutrient constraints (Pulliam 1975) or predator learning (Hughes 1979; Stenseth and Hansson 1979; Pulliam 1980) may, in fact, be more appropriate.

TI  - Low Rate of Pre-Dispersal Acorn Predation by Eurasian Jays Garrulus glandarius during Non-Mast Years
PY  - 2023
AB  - Mast-seeding is widely considered to be an adaptation that minimizes seed predation. The superabundance of seeds during mast years greatly exceeds the capacity of seed predators to consume them. These notions were based on research on food specialists such as insects and rodents. However, mast-seeding may have different impact on the behavior of corvids that are food generalists. The Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius is a widespread scatter-hoarding corvid that uses acorns as a food reserve for winter. In mast-years, the birds are supposed to be satiated by the greater seed supply and are able to store their surplus, acting as dispersal agents, whereas in poor crop seasons they use most of the crop for current consumption and thus become seed predators. In such a situation, a dispersal agent may become a seed predator, and vice versa. The main task of this study was to determine the levels of pre-dispersal acorn predation by Jays during non-mast years to verify the notion that under such conditions Jays act mostly as seed consumers. During two consecutive non-mast years, tagged acorns were radio-tracked and the acorns' fate (cached or eaten) was assessed. We found extremely low pre-dispersal acorn predation by Jays (0.9%). The possible reason is that temperatures in period of acorns collecting (September–October) are high enough to allow invertebrates to remain active, so the Jays may supplement their diet with insects and also fleshy fruits. Therefore, almost all acorns were cached and scatter-hoarding Jays provided effective seed dispersal, with extremely low consumption of acorns.

TI  - Mast seeding under increasing drought: results from a long-term data set and from a rainfall exclusion experiment.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Mast seeding, the synchronous, highly variable seed production among years, is very common in tree species, but there is no consensus about its main causes and the main environmental factors affecting it. In this study, we first analyze a long-term data set on reproductive and vegetative growth of Quercus ilex in a mediterranean woodland in order to identify the main environmental drivers of interannual variation in flower and seed production and contrast the impact of climate vs. adaptive factors as main causes of masting. Second, we conducted an experiment of rainfall exclusion to evaluate the effects of an increasing drought (simulating predictions of global change models) on both reproductive processes. The annual seed crop was always affected by environmental factors related to the precipitation pattern, these abiotic factors disrupting the fruiting process at different periods of time. Seed production was strongly dependent upon water availability for the plant at initial (spring) and advanced (summer) stages of the acorn maturation cycle, whereas the final step of seed development was negatively affected by the frequency of torrential-rain events. We also found clear evidence that seed masting in the study species is not only regulated by selective endogenous rhythms, but is mainly a physiological response to the variable environment. Our results from the rainfall exclusion experiment corroborated the conclusions obtained from the 26-year fruiting record and demonstrated that the high interannual variation in seed crop was mainly determined by the success in seed development rather than by the flowering effort. Under a global change scenario, it could be expected that the drier conditions predicted by climate models reinforce the negative effects of summer drought on seed production, leading to negative consequences for tree recruitment and forest dynamics.

TI  - Interannual variation in tree seed production in a primeval temperate forest: does masting prevail?
PY  - 2014
AB  - We assessed seed production by mature individuals of five dominant tree species in the strictly protected reserve of Bialowieza National Park (Poland) from 2002 to 2013. Interannual variation in seed production was extreme, generally asynchronous among species. All species exhibited high variability in seed production, ranging from bumper crops in some years to no seeds in others. All species exhibited a typical “normal masting” pattern, which was most pronounced in Picea abies and Quercus robur, moderate in Carpinus betulus and least expressed in Acer platanoides and Tilia cordata. Within species, crop sizes were well synchronised among areas and individuals; seed production was most synchronised in P. abies and Q. robur and least synchronised in T. cordata and A. platanoides within a season. Among species, interannual variability was negatively correlated with seasonal synchrony among individuals. Besides a negative correlation between rainfall during the flowering period and seed crop in three deciduous species, variation in temperature and rainfall in periods critical to seed formation was uncorrelated with the variation in seed crops. Heavy defoliation by caterpillars coincided with a poor seed crop of deciduous trees in 2003. Generally, the variation in seed crops was much higher than the variability of environmental factors. Deciduous species could produce bumper crops in consecutive years and were not necessarily forced to “switch” to non-reproduction by resource depletion. It appears that trees could apparently assess when and how intensively to reproduce. We discuss adaptive benefits of masting reproduction that include pollination efficiency, predator satiation and seed dispersal.

TI  - Recent developments in understanding mast seeding in relation to dynamics of carbon and nitrogen resources in temperate trees
PY  - 2017
AB  - Mast seeding, the synchronous intermittent production of large seed crops in populations of perennial plants, is a widespread and widely studied phenomenon. Economy of scale has been demonstrated to provide the ultimate selection factor driving the evolution of masting, for example, in terms of the predator-satiation and pollination-efficiency hypotheses; however, its physiological mechanism is still poorly understood. The resource budget (RB) model assumes that an individual plant requires more resources to flower and fruit than it gains in a year, and therefore only flowers when a specific threshold amount of stored resources is surpassed. Although the RB models have been well explored theoretically, including for resource depletion and pollen coupling, empirical data to support these assumptions are still disputed. Here, we explore the extent to which the RB model applies to masting tree species, focusing on the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen resources in natural temperate forests. There is little empirical evidence that plants use carbohydrates stored over several years to produce fruits; however, nitrogen stores in temperate trees are more commonly depleted after masting. We review the internal nitrogen cycle including resorption during leaf senescence, storage and remobilization, discussing the effect of masting on these processes. Overall, carbohydrates and nitrogen are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving mast seeding, but the determinant resource seems to be species specific.

<jats:italic>Copaifera langsdorffii</jats:italic>
</jats:styled-content> is a tropical tree species with supra‐annual fruiting, which has its seeds predated by a specialist endogenous insect (<jats:italic>Rynochenus brevicollis</jats:italic>: Curculionidae) in the <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">Brazilian</jats:styled-content> savanna. Three hypotheses were addressed: (i) the predator satiation hypothesis, (ii) the resource concentration hypothesis and (iii) the larger seed predation hypothesis. A total of 112 individual <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">
<jats:italic>C. langsdorffii</jats:italic>
</jats:styled-content> were monitored monthly from <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">January</jats:styled-content> to <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">August</jats:styled-content> during four consecutive years (from 2008 to 2011) to determine the presence of fruits on each plant. All trees produced fruits in the year 2008, whereas none of them produced flowers or fruits in 2009 or 2010. Moreover, only 65 individuals (58%) marked in 2008 produced fruits in 2011. The number of fruits per plant was approximately 21% greater in 2008 than in 2011, while the percentage of seed predation was 76% greater in 2011, thereby supporting the predator satiation hypothesis. The percentage of seeds predated was not affected by the number of fruits per plant. Therefore, our data did not support the resource concentration hypothesis. Plants producing large seeds experienced more seed predation by <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">
<jats:italic>R. brevicollis</jats:italic>,</jats:styled-content> supporting the larger seed predation hypothesis. In addition, we also observed a positive relationship between seed volume and adult <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">

TI  - Implications of a long-term mast seeding cycle for climatic entrainment, seedling establishment and persistent monodominance in a Neotropical, ectomycorrhizal canopy tree
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In Guyana, we examined temporal variability and ecological consequences of seed‐based reproduction in the ectomycorrhizal, monodominant leguminous canopy tree <jats:italic>Dicymbe corymbosa</jats:italic> using an extensive 2003–2017 dataset encompassing two masting events. Annual seed output, predation and nutrient investment were recorded in primary <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case"><jats:italic>D. corymbosa</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> forests. Seedling establishment, survival and growth were monitored. Mast seeding occurred in 2003 and 2016 and low seeding events occurred every 3–4 years, separated by non‐reproductive years. In accordance with predicted climatic entrainment of regional masting, El Niño‐intensified dry seasons preceded each masting event but not low seeding events. The regularly variable seeding pattern by <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case"><jats:italic>D. corymbosa</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> suggests that innate supra‐annual periodicity may initiate <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case"><jats:italic>D. corymbosa</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> flowering. Internal resource thresholds may also contribute to periodicity, but El Niño‐associated intensified dry seasons appear necessary to entrain mass flowering and successful mast seeding across the region. In accordance with a predator satiation hypothesis, seed predation was proportionally higher during low seed years. Competitive gains from the 2016 masting event were evidenced by strong replenishment of declining seedling pools.</jats:p>

TI  - Masting is uncommon in trees that depend on mutualist dispersers in the context of global climate and fertility gradients.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The benefits of masting (volatile, quasi-synchronous seed production at lagged intervals) include satiation of seed predators, but these benefits come with a cost to mutualist pollen and seed dispersers. If the evolution of masting represents a balance between these benefits and costs, we expect mast avoidance in species that are heavily reliant on mutualist dispersers. These effects play out in the context of variable climate and site fertility among species that vary widely in nutrient demand. Meta-analyses of published data have focused on variation at the population scale, thus omitting periodicity within trees and synchronicity between trees. From raw data on 12 million tree-years worldwide, we quantified three components of masting that have not previously been analysed together: (i) volatility, defined as the frequency-weighted year-to-year variation; (ii) periodicity, representing the lag between high-seed years; and (iii) synchronicity, indicating the tree-to-tree correlation. Results show that mast avoidance (low volatility and low synchronicity) by species dependent on mutualist dispersers explains more variation than any other effect. Nutrient-demanding species have low volatility, and species that are most common on nutrient-rich and warm/wet sites exhibit short periods. The prevalence of masting in cold/dry sites coincides with climatic conditions where dependence on vertebrate dispersers is less common than in the wet tropics. Mutualist dispersers neutralize the benefits of masting for predator satiation, further balancing the effects of climate, site fertility and nutrient demands.

TI  - The interacting effects of clumped seed dispersal and distance- and density-dependent mortality on seedling recruitment patterns
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. Seed dispersal and natural enemies both influence spatial patterns of seedlings, which in turn influence future abiotic and biotic interactions, with consequences for plant populations, distributions and diversity. Clumped seed deposition is common, especially for vertebrate-dispersed seeds, and has the potential to significantly affect interactions with density-responsive enemies, yet has received relatively little attention. 2. We used spatially explicit simulation models to examine how different patterns of seed dispersal and natural enemy attack structure seedling spatial patterns. We simulated clumped seed dispersal by combining a two-dimensional Student’s T dispersal kernel for expected seed rain with a negative binomial distribution for seed deposition. We based our models for seed mortality on published data reflecting differing life histories of insect seed predators and soil-borne pathogens. We varied dispersal distance, degree of clumping, type of enemy, enemy dispersal distance and fecundity among simulations. 3. Under insect seed predation, seeds escaped predation by dispersing longer distances than insects, resulting in ‘Janzen–Connell’ patterns in which seedling recruitment peaks at intermediate distances. When insects dispersed longer distances than seeds, higher seed densities near the tree satiated insects, resulting in ‘McCanny’ patterns in which seed deposition, survivorship and seedling establishment all decrease with distance from the parent tree. Total seedling establishment was lowest when insects and seeds dispersed similar distances. 4. Under pathogen attack, Janzen–Connell patterns predominated except when seedling survival was virtually zero or one everywhere, or in the case where pathogen dispersal distances exceeded seed dispersal distances, producing ‘Hubbell’ patterns in which seed deposition and seedling establishment decrease with distance, though survivorship increases. 5. Clumped seed deposition increased the probability of seedling establishment under both insect seed predation and pathogen attack as it led to local satiation of insect seed predators and made it harder for pathogen distributions to track seeds. 6. Synthesis. Our modelling study suggests that the relative dispersal distances of seeds and natural enemies are crucial to determining establishment rates and spatial patterns of seedlings. Better characterization of the movement and natural histories of natural enemies is critical to improving our understanding of seedling distributions and plant–enemy interactions.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Masting is a common reproductive strategy regulating seedling regeneration in many perennial plant species. The evolutionary origins and functional benefits of masting have been explained by well‐supported hypotheses relating to economies of scale of seed production. Nevertheless, our understanding of the potential costs of masting for the plant seed‐to‐seedling transitions remains limited.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We tracked the seed fate and documented changes in the seed spatial distribution patterns during the seed‐to‐seedling transition process of <jats:italic>Castanopsis fargesii</jats:italic>, a dominant species of subtropical evergreen broad‐leaved forests in China under natural conditions for more than 6 years.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Masting resulted in a high proportion of seeds escaping predation by vertebrates and rodents, supporting the predator satiation hypothesis. However, it increased the pre‐dispersal seed predation by insects, and decreased the seed germination rate due to a negative effect on seed mass. This resulted in seed‐to‐seedling transition rates during mast years to be roughly half as much as during non‐mast years. In addition, masting negatively affected the spatial rearrangement of seeds, resulting in a spatial aggregative distribution pattern of newly germinated seedlings. The combined negative effects of smaller seeds and spatially aggregated seedlings reduced the survival rate of newly germinated seedlings at seedling establishment stage.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Considering the whole seed‐to‐established seedling transition process, the benefits of masting on seedling recruitment due to the effective seed predator situation by vertebrates and rodents were decreased by the additional costs on seed mass, seed germination, seed spatial arrangement and seedling establishment. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the positive and negative effects of masting at each stage of the seed‐to‐seedling transition. Inferences based on seed predation and recruitment of newly germinated seedlings alone would lead to an overly optimistic conclusion about the benefits of masting.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

AB  - Bamboos are known for flowering simultaneously over a wide geographic range at long intervals of more than several decades. Florivory by Dicraeus phyllostachyus and D. nartshukae causes severe damage to bamboo seed production. However, the nature of the life history of the two Dicraeus species, particularly how they sustain populations during non-masting years of bamboos such as their host plant range, is poorly explored. We hypothesised that the two Dicraeus species host on other plant species and/or on non-floral organs of bamboos and move to bamboo florets during masting years. We tested whether the two Dicraeus species oviposit and develop on florets of grasses excluding bamboos (other grasses), and on non-floral organs of bamboos, including branch buds and bamboo shoots, by conducting a natural population survey and laboratory experiments. We found that the two Dicraeus species utilise short, slender shoots of Phyllostachys nigra var. henonis and a few other grass florets in the natural populations. Laboratory experiments also showed that the two Dicraeus species oviposited and fed on non-floral organs of bamboos and several species of other grass florets, although the oviposition rate and number of eggs varied among organs and the survival rate was low on most other grass florets. The generalised feeding ability may have enabled the two Dicraeus species to utilise the bamboo florets during masting years and become the dominant florivorous insect of bamboos. Unravelling their life history strategies may contribute to understanding adaptation in florivorous insects of masting plants as well as their impact on the evolution of masting in plants.

TI  - The selective advantage of mast flowering in Veratrum album subsp. oxysepalum: Implications of the predator satiation hypothesis.
PY  - 2022
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PREMISE">Synchronous, highly variable flower or seed production among years within a population (i.e., masting) has been reported in numerous perennial plants. Although masting provides ecological advantages such as enhancing pollination efficiency and/or escape from predator attack, little is known about the degree of these advantages and variations in masting behavior among populations of conspecific plants.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We determined flowering ramet density and reproductive success (fruit-set success and herbivorous damage) of a perennial herb, Veratrum album subsp. oxysepalum, across six lowland and six alpine populations in northern Japan during 2-3 years. We then analyzed the relationship between floral density and reproductive success to assess the ecological significance of mast flowering. Flowering intervals of individual plants were estimated by counting annual scars on rhizomes.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Most populations had mast flowering, but the intervals between flowering for individual plants were shorter in the alpine populations than in the lowland populations. Floral damage by stem borers (dipteran larvae) and seed predation by lepidopteran larvae were intense in the lowland populations. Seed production of individual ramets increased with higher floral density owing to the effective avoidance of floral-stem damage and seed predation. Although stem borers were absent in the alpine habitat, seed predation decreased with higher floral density also in the alpine populations. Pollination success was independent of floral density in both of the alpine and lowland populations.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">These results strongly support the predator satiation hypothesis for mast flowering by this species.</AbstractText>
