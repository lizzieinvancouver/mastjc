TI  - Rodent population dynamics in a primeval deciduous forest (Białowieża National Park) in relation to weather, seed crop, and predation
PY  - 1993
AB  - Population dynamics of forest rodents, bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780) and yellow-necked mice Apodemus flavicollis (Melchior, 1834) were studied in 1959-1991 in the pristine mature forest dominated by hornbeam Carpinus betulus and oak Quercus robur in Bialowieza National Park (eastern Poland). The whole 33-year series, and particularly the detailed data from 1971-1991, were related to weather data and seed crop of hornbeam, oak, and maple Acer platanoides.

TI  - Ecotypic Differentiation in Otago Populations of Narrowleaved Snow Tussock, Chionochloa rigida
PY  - 1965
AB  - Summary The transplanting of segments of mature tussocks reciprocally between four field sites and also to a garden in a milder forest climate has shown that an interplay of genetic and environmental differences determines most of the variation between populations. Some of the genetically controlled morphological differences appear to have no survival value and are probably the result of correlated responses to the selective effect of the environment on the genetic system controlling growth. Genctic variation that is adaptive is displayed in the response to temperature of floral induction, and in the adjustment of flowering time and growth periods. It appears that some altitudinal variation within the species is ccoclinal, but the results based on only four populations suggest the presence of a distinct high-altitude ecotype of short tussocks above about 1,500 m. Populations arc variable with potential for further adjustment, but this must inevitably be slow because of longevity of tussocks, infrequent fl...

TI  - Comparison of radiative and physiological effects of doubled atmospheric CO2 on climate
PY  - 1996
AB  - The physiological response of terrestrial vegetation when directly exposed to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration could result in warming over the continents in addition to that due to the conventional CO 2 “greenhouse effect.” Results from a coupled biosphere-atmosphere model (SiB2-GCM) indicate that, for doubled CO 2 conditions, evapotranspiration will drop and air temperature will increase over the tropical continents, amplifying the changes resulting from atmospheric radiative effects. The range of responses in surface air temperature and terrestrial carbon uptake due to increased CO 2 are projected to be inversely related in the tropics year-round and inversely related during the growing season elsewhere.

TI  - Nutrient concentrations in narrow-leaved snow tussock (Chionochloa rigida) after spring burning
PY  - 1986
AB  - Abstract The mean concentration of total major nutrients increased by 82 percent in the leaf tissue, changed little in the stem tissue, and decreased by 62 percent in the root tissue of snow tussocks (Chionochloa) in the year after spring burning. This resulted from an immediate reallocation of nutrients, principally nitrogen and potassium, from root to leaf tissue, and from increased nutrient availability resulting from modified soil conditions. By the eighth year after fire nutrient concentrations were again equivalent to unburnt plants in leaf tissue, but had declined significantly in stem tissue. Nutrient concentrations remained significantly depressed in root tissue throughout the 13 years after fire. It is suggested that a rapid depletion of nutrients after fire in soils of naturally low fertility could subsequently limit the amount of nutrient uptake from the soil for at least 13 years after a single fire, and account for the decline in leaf growth and the depression of flowering after the second year

AB  - Global warming would diminish biological diversity by causing extinctions among reserve species. Patterns of climatic change are discussed, including global patterns of surface temperature increase, as predicted by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and global changes in moisture patterns. The concept of biological reserves (essentially the same concept as biological refugia) is discussed, and the effect of climatic changes on reserves is discussed. The types of biological communities particularly at risk due to climatic changes are identified. 67 references, 3 figures.

TI  - Potential magnitude of future vegetation change in eastern north america: comparisons with the past.
PY  - 1991
AB  - Increases in atmospheric trace gas concentrations could warm the global average temperature 1.5° to 4.5°C by the end of the next century. Application of climate-pollen response surfaces to three climate model simulations of doubled preindustrial atmospheric CO 2 levels shows that the change in the equilibrium distribution of natural vegetation over eastern North America over the next 200 to 500 years could be larger than the overall change during the past 7,000 to 10,000 years and equivalent to the change that took place over the 1,000- to 3,000-year period of most rapid deglaciation. Some plant ranges and abundance maxima could shift as much as 500 to 1000 km during the next 200 to 500 years; such changes would have dramatic impacts on silvicultural and natural ecosystems. Although unprecedented vegetation change is likely if climate changes as predicted, forecasting the exact timing and patterns of change will be difficult.

TI  - Mast seeding of Chionochloa (Poaceae) and pre-dispersal seed predation by a specialist fly (Diplotoxa, Diptera: Chloropidae)
PY  - 1992
AB  - Abstract Levels of seed predation were recorded between 1986 and 1992 in Chionochloa pattens, C. oreophila, C. flavescens, C. macra, and C. crassiuscula populations at various altitudes at three sites in Canterbury. There were consistently high levels of attack by a chloropid fly, Diplotoxa similis: between 22 and 94% of florets showed evidence of fly damage, except at higher altitudes (decreasing to 2% in C. pattens at 1620 m) and in C. oreophila (6 – 10%). Since D. similis emerges rapidly from the pupa and since larvae possibly move between florets, the number of insects found underestimated the number of florets predated by up to 90%. Seed set varied from 2% to 59% and was negatively correlated with seed predation. Two other Chionochloa seed predators have been reported previously: a moth, Megacraspedus calamogonus, and an unidentified cecidomyiid (gall midge) larva. In this study, larvae similar to Megacraspedus were very rare, and we suggest that the unidentified cecidomyiid is actually a misidentifi...

TI  - Quantifying the benefits of mast seeding on predator satiation and wind pollination in Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae)
PY  - 1997
AB  - Mast seeding could be favoured by a number of factors, including predator satiation and wind pollination. When both these factors could be involved, determining which is more important has been very difficult. In this paper we present 10 years of data on flowering intensity, seed predation and estimated pollination success for Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae), an alpine tussock grass, at Mt Hutt, South Island, New Zealand. C. pallens suffers from high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation (up to 94%) and is wind pollinated, so provides an ideal experimental system. C. pallens had very variable flowering intensity between years (coefficient of variation of floret production (CV)= 1.80). A significant predator satiation effect was found. Predation was not affected by the absolute level of flowering intensity in the current year, but did vary significantly with the change in flowering intensity between the current and previous years. Therefore, predator satiation seemed to involve a numerical response (starving the predator in low seed years). There was a significant wind pollination benefit from larger flowering efforts, which depended only on the size of the current flowering effort. Therefore, for benefits via pollination, C. pallens populations with high levels of resources can satisfactorily produce a large flowering effort every year; in contrast, to gain benefits via predator satiation, fluctuating flowering intensity is required regardless of mean levels. The relative benefits of masting versus constant reproduction were modelled; benefits from wind pollination increased very little with increased CVs, to give a benefit of 2.3% fewer florets with unexpanded ovaries at the field CV of 1.8 than at CV = 0. The overall mean flowering effort is apparently high enough in the study population for efficient pollination even if masting did not occur. Predator satiation gave large benefits from masting, from 8% of all florets at Cv = 1.25 increasing rapidly to 42% at CV = 1.8 and 62% at CV = 2.25. Therefore predator satiation is vastly more important than wind pollination in favouring mast seeding in C. pallens, providing 92-95% of the benefits at CVs>1.5. The rapid increase in benefits from predator satiation at CV > 1.5 may help explain why Chionochloa species have such high CVs.

TI  - Mast production and winter populations of red-headed woodpeckers and blue jays
PY  - 1987
AB  - In 17 Missouri counties in which Christmas bird counts have been conducted, patterns of mast production since 1960 were compared using annual fall mast survey data collected by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Within most counties a positive relationship existed among walnuts (Juglans spp.), hickories (Carya spp.), and white oaks (Quercus spp., subgenus Lepidobalanus) for both numbers of trees with heavy mast crops and a mast production index. Mast production by red oaks (Q. spp., subgenus Erythrobalanus) also was generally positively correlated with those 3 mast groups, even though red oak acorns take 1 year longer to mature than nuts from the other 3 groups. To compare mast crops initiated in the same year, the red oak mast data were lagged 1 year and compared with the other mast groups. The weak results from that analysis suggest that factors affecting acorn growth are more important than factors affecting seed set in mast trees. Mast production of pecan hickories (Carya illinoensis) seemed unrelated to the other 4 mast groups. Results of this study demonstrate that mast production among a variety of tree species was synchronous over relatively small areas. Within most of the 17 counties examined, a positive relationship existed between acorn abundance and wintering numbers of red-headed woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), a species that relies heavily on acorns as a winter food source. No such relationship was found between acorn abundance and wintering number of blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata), a species that stores acorns in the fall, but uses a variety of winter food sources. This suggests that dependency on mast crops as a food source determines how closely animals track changes in mast abundance. J. WILDL. MANAGE. 51(2):459-467 Mast has long been recognized as important food for many birds and mammals; e.g., Lay and Siegler 1937, Van Dersal 1940, Cypert and Webster 1948, Christisen and Korschgen 1955, Perrins 1966. Despite that importance, surprisingly little is known about temporal or spatial patterns of mast abundance in North America (e.g., Bock and Lepthien 1976). Most reports concerning mast abundance have focussed on small areas for short periods of time (e.g., Burns et al. 1954, Gysel 1956, Sork 1983) and many reported abundances are anecdotal (e.g., Bagg 1969). The few relatively long-term studies on mast abundance (e.g., Goodrum et al. 1971, Beck 1977) demonstrate that most mast tree species have abundant crops every 2-5 years (Fowells 1965) although a regular pattern may not exist. Most mast trees do not produce abundant crops in consecutive years (Silvertown 1980). Little information is available on interspecific patterns of mast production; e.g., Nicholas and White 1984. Downs and McQuilkin (1944) and Goodrum et al. (1971) both remarked on a tendency for mast trees of several species to have abundant crops in the same year, but this has not been rigorously tested. Given that mast crops in a region fluctuate in both space and time, they generally are not a dependable food resource (Silvertown 1980). During periods of mast shortage, mast-eating animals must either switch to alternative food resources or migrate to areas with higher mast abundance; e.g., Bock et al. 1971, Nicholas and White 1984. Population fluctuations of animals that depend on mast for food are generally greater than those of species that can switch to other food sources (Watts 1969, Smith 1986b). Here we examine patterns of fall mast abundance among tree species in 17 Missouri counties, based on long-term mast survey data collect d by the Missouri Department of Conservation. The 17 counties selected are ones in which Christmas bird counts have been conducted in Missouri, allowing direct comparisons among mast abundance patterns and winter populations of red-headed woodpeckers and blue jays over relatively small areas. Both bird species occur throughout Missouri, store mast in fall, and can occur in relatively large numbers on Christmas bird counts (Smith 1986a). Population densities of those 2 species also fluctuate from winter to winter, presumably in response to changes in mast abundance (Bock et al. 1971, Smith 1986b). We gratefully acknowledge the willingness of D. M. Christisen to share the Mo. mast data collected under his direction for many years.

PY  - 1993
AB  - Abstract Regeneration of Chionochloa rigida ssp. rigida (Poaceae) was investigated in two adjacent unburnt sites subjected to different levels of grazing by merino sheep over an 8 year period. The spatial pattern of establishment of immature plants within a 3 m radius of 100 isolated mature tussocks (basal diameter >20 cm) was recorded. Basal diameter, height, canopy width, slope, and aspect of the putative parents were noted, was was the size and position of the immature plants (basal diameter <10 cm). At the lower grazing intensity the number of immature plants increased with tussock size. Small tussocks had disproportionately few immature plants. The regeneration shadow was highly skewed, 72% of all immature plants occurring downhill and downwind from the tussock. Highest densities of recruits established between 0.5 m and 1.0 m from tussock centres. Few immature plants established within one diameter of the base of mature plants. Grazing affected regeneration by: (a) reducing overall recruitment (0.90...

PY  - 1986
AB  - Abstract The numbers of flowering stems of Phormium tenax in and near Wellington City fluctuated up to 75-fold between good and bad years. P. tenax flowered prolifically over most of central New Zealand in the summers of 1978/79, 1981/82, and 1985/86 but produced few flowers in the summers of 1976/77, 1979/80, and 1982/83. P. cookianum flowering fluctuated 10-fold between good and bad years. Poor and heavy flowering years for P. tenax and P. cookianum coincided but P. cookianum produced additional flowering peaks in 1977/78 and 1980/81. Light, moderate, and heavy summer flowering of P. tenax was inversely correlated with wet weather the previous February (r = -0.789) and high absolute air temperatures during the previous April to June (r = 0.969). The spectacular flowering of P. tenax in the summer of 1981/82 was probably induced by exceptionally high air temperatures on 9 May 1981. Phormium tenax in Wellington flowered synchronously with alpine tussock (Chionochloa) in Nelson and some Nothofagus species....

TI  - CO2 effects on the water budget of grassland microcosm communities
PY  - 1997
AB  - Experimental grassland ecosystems, in microcosms 0.2 m in diameter and with a 0.95 m soil column, varied in their responses to elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and altered moisture inputs. Ecosystems on moderately fertile sandstone soil and with a typical mix of moderately fast-growing sandstone species, responded to elevated pCO2 with decreases in mid-season evapotranspiration of nearly 50%. This pattern reversed at the end of the growing season, and sandstone ecosystems under elevated pCO2 continued active transpiration farther into the summer drought. The sandstone ecosystems appeared to convert mid-season water conservation into increased late-season growth. Effects of increased pCO2 on ecosystem evapotranspiration were much smaller in ecosystems with very infertile serpentine soil and a diverse mixture of slow-growing serpentine species.

PY  - 1997
AB  - We measured leaf-level stomata1 conductance, xylem pressure potential, and stomate number and size as well as whole plant sap flow and canopy-level water vapour fluxes in a C4-tallgrass prairie in Kansas exposed to ambient and elevated C02. Stomata1 conductance was reduced by as much as 50% under elevated CO2 compared to ambient. In addition, there was a reduction in stomate number of the C4 grass, Andropogon gerardii Vitman, and the C3 dicot herb, Salvia pitcheri Tort, under elevated CO2 compared to ambient. The result was an improved water status for plants exposed to elevated CO2 which was reflected by a less negative xylem pressure potential compared to plants exposed to ambient CO*. Sap flow rates were 20 to 30% lower for plants exposed to elevated CO2 than for those exposed to ambient CO*. At the canopy level, evapotranspiration was reduced by 22% under elevated C02. The reduced water use by the plant canopy under elevated CO2 extended the photosynthetically-active period when water became limiting in the ecosystem. The result was an increased above- and belowground biomass production in years when water stress was frequent.

TI  - Interactions Among Gypsy Moths, White-footed Mice, and Acorns
PY  - 1996
AB  - Low-density populations of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, were studied over a 10-yr period in Massachusetts. Increases in gypsy moth density were associated with declines in density of the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, a principal predator. Furthermore, changes in density of P. leucopus populations were positively correlated with the density of acorn crops, a dominant winter food source for these mice. To demonstrate these effects we used a novel bootstrap regression method that adjusts for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the time series data. The findings are compatible with a dual equilibrium model of gypsy moth population dynamics, in which low densities are regulated by mice and high densities are regulated by other factors, notably a virus disease.

PY  - 1975
AB  - Abstract Thirty-thousand florets from 5 Chionochloa species (Gramineae: Arundinoideae) were examined for insect damage in a survey of 22 alpine tussock grassland sites in the South Island. The five tall lussock species are C. flaveseens, C. maera, C. pallens, C. rigida, and C. rubra, and the investigation of floret damage was in two parts: (a) an annual assessment of seed damage over 5 years (1969–73) at one site; (b) a survey and assessment of seed damage at 21 further sites in 1 year only (1970). Three insect species were recorded feeding in florets: Megaeraspedus ealamogonus (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), Diplotoxa neozelandiea (?) (Diptera: Chloropidae), and an unidentified gall midge (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Larvae of the first two species feed on the developing ovary, and were shown to be capable of severely reducing seed production, at times causing 100% destruction in localised areas. At least in some grasslands, the occurrence of empty florets without any discernible trace of insect damage was show...

TI  - Seed Predation by Animals
PY  - 1971
AB  - Many plants suffer very heavy preand/or post-dispersal seed predation by animals. A few exemplary studies (2,18,38,52,74,87, 106, 110, 111, 124, 140, 161, 162, 171, 181, 187, 196, 197, 203, 205, 207, 217, 220, 227) and a variety of shorter reports scattered through the agricultural, botanical, and zoological literature suggest a large and important, yet unexploited, field of study. It is clear that the pattern of seed predation is highly structured and that it co evolved at, the chemical, spatial, and temporal level. It involves all levels of animal-plant interaction from the internal energy budget of indi­ viduals to the entire community (203 ) . Owing to parental and sibling com­ petition, successful development of a seedling may depend on the seed's dis­ persal (101). Equally important, thc seed must escape from the predators at the seed crop and in the parent plant's habitat before and after dispersal (111 ) . The game is played by mobile predators in search of sessile prey; escape is through a single dispersal move, seed chemistry, parental morphol­ ogy and behavior, and evolutionary change. The processes and patterns are:ideal candidates for ecological and evolu­ tionary analyses (83, 111 ) of the typcs traditionally conducted by zoologi­ cally oriented biologists (37, 51,73, 141, 155,156, 182) or applied to plants in general ( 40,116,208,209,241) . Seed predators and leaf eaters are often lumped together in ecological discussions, but they differ in ways especially important in the coevolution of seed predators and seeds: (a) Like leaves, seeds are highly subdivided and small, but unlike leaves and other vegetative parts, they have very high nutrient values per unit volume. ( b) While obvious in large quantities, they may be extremely inconspicuous once dispersed. ( c) Being comparatively dormant, seeds have low self-repair abilities but can contain high concentra­ tions of toxic compounds (secondary substances) with less sophisticated ad­ aptations against self-intoxication than can leaves and meristematic tissues. ( d ) Seed production is not continually required for direct survival of the parent plant; seed timing, quantity, and quality can therefore be manipu­ lated more freely by natural selection than can these traits of leaves and other vegetative parts. (e ) Seeds are not directly replaced· when killed or germinated; once removed, seeds may be absent far longer than edible vege­ tative parts and thus a common plant species may be rare in time,toa seed

TI  - New Approaches Toward a Better Understanding of the Decline of Takahe (Porphyrio mantelli) in New Zealand
PY  - 1995
AB  - Island populations of endemic birds are known to be particularly susceptible to extinction. This paper focuses on factors behind past and present declines of the highly endangered Takahe (Porphyrio mantelli), a flightless rail endemic to New Zealand. Subfossil evidence indicates that Takahe were once found throughout this island nation, being most abundant along forest margins and streams in lowland regions. Their numbers have declined dramatically since human colonization about 800–1000 years ago, probably due to a combination of habitat destruction and hunting by early Polynesian settlers. Today, the wild Takahe population consists of about 100 adult birds in an isolated alpine habitat and approximately 30 individuals recently released on several small offshore islands. Despite protection and intensive management, including removal of an introduced competitor (red deer, Cervus elaphus), the alpine population has continued to decline. In contrast, the Takahe’s nearest relative, the Pukeko (Porphyrio porphyrio) has expanded its range across New Zealand despite heavy hunting pressure since its colonization from Australia less than 1000 years ago. We suggest that, unlike Pukeko, Takahe lack appropriate behavioral responses to cope with mammalian predators such as stoats (Mustela erminea), which have been introduced relatively recently by European colonists. A study comparing predator defense behavior between these two closely related species is currently underway.



Es sabido que las poblaciones endemicas de aves insulares son particularmente susceptibles a la extincion. Este trabajo se centra en los factores de declinacion pasados y presentes del Takahe (Porphyrio mantelli), un ave zancuda no voladora endemica a Nueva Zelandia, que se encuentra en peligro de extincion extremo. Evidencias de subfosiles Takahe se le encontraba alguna de toda esta nacion insular, siendo mas abundante vez al los margenes de los bosques y en arroyos en regiones de tierras bajas. Sus numeros disminuyeron dramaticamente desde la colonizacion humana, hace unos 800 o 1000 anos, probablemente debido a una combinacion de la destruccion del habitat y ta caceria por parte de los primeros colonos Polinesios. En la actualidad, la poblacion silvestre del Takahe consiste en alrededor de 100 aves adultas en un habitat alpino aislado y unos 30 individuos que fueron dejados en libertad recientemente en varias islas pequenas a escasa distancia de la costa. A pesar de la proteccion y del manejo intensivo, que incluye la remocion de un competidor introducido (el ciervo rojo, Cervus elaphus) la poblacion alpina ha continuado su declinacion. En forma opuesta, el pariente mas cercano del Takahe, el Pukeko (Porphyrio porphyrio), ha expandido su area de distribucion a traves de Nueva Zelandia, a pesar de las presiones de la caza desde su colonizacion desde Australia, menos de 1000 anos atras. Sugerimos que, a diferencia del Pukeko, el Takahe carece de respuestas de comportamiento apropiadas para enfrentar predadores mamiferos, tales como el armino (Mustela erminea), que ha sido introducido en tiempos relativamente recientes por colonos Europeos. Actualmente se esta llevando a cabo un estudio, que compara el comportamiento defensivo contra predadores de estas dos especies estrechamente relacionadas.

TI  - The evolutionary ecology of mast seeding in trees
PY  - 1980
AB  - The hypothesis that masting by trees is a defensive strategy which satiates seed predators in mast years and starves them in the intervening periods is tested in 59 sets of data on the seed production and pre-dispersal seed-predation of 25 tree species. Twenty-lour of the 59 data-sets support the hypothesis and show a statistically significant positive relationship between the proportion of seeds surviving the pre-dispersal stage and the log10 of the crop size for the same year. Evidence that pre-dispersal seed survival increases with the length of the mast interval is poor.



A positive relationship between the strength of the masting habit and the maxintum observed pre-dispersal seed mortality in a sample of 15 tree species suggests that the masting habit is best developed in predator-prone species. A survey of seed crop frequencies in the woody plant flora of Nortli America shows masting species to be under-represented amongst shrubs and amongst trees which disperse their seeds in fleshy dispersal units. The selection pressures and evolutionary constraints which operate on the evolution of masting plants and their seed predators are discussed.

TI  - Food selection by Tahake Notornis mantelli in relation to chemical composition
PY  - 1991
AB  - Selective feeding by the Takahe Notornis mantelli, an endangered, flightless, herbivorous rail, endemic to New Zealand, was studied in the Murchison Mountains, Fiordland, between 1976 and 1980. Takahe occupy the alpine grasslands throughout the snow-free period and have a simple diet consisting of leaf bases of snow tussock grasses (Chionochloa pallens, C. flavescens, C. crassiuscula) and a mountain daisy Celmisia petriei. Changes in seasonal diet between plant species and between plants of the same species were examined in relation to the mineral nutrient, carbohydrate, lipid and soluble sugar content. Tussock species eaten by Takahe contained more nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sodium and soluble sugars than those eaten less frequently or avoided, but selection for specific nutrients changed seasonally. Takahe selected within and between species for high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in spring-early summer, and for carbohydrates in late summer-early autumn. Amongst the tussock grasses, the birds displayed a preference for actively growing, nutrient-rich tissue and appeared to differentiate between species and among sites along an altitudinal gradient to take advantage of interand intra-specific differences in the onset of growth flushes. Takahe also favoured leaf bases of flowering tussock tillers. Observations of Takahe feeding behaviour on Chionochloa pallens showed that the birds sampled widely before intensively feeding on a tussock. It is suggested that the basis for food selection involves discrimination by visual qualities and chemical cues associated with taste.

TI  - Flowering, seeding, and seedling establishment of narrow-leaved Snow Tussock, Chionochloa Rigida
PY  - 1965
AB  - Summary The infrequent flowering years of the narrow-leaved snow tussock appear to depend on abnormally high temperatures during the long-day period of summer in the season before flowering. Physiological induction then occurs and morphological initiation of the inflorescence may take place during autumn, or it may be delayed until early spring, i.e., for about eight months. IntenSity of flowering increases with the duration of high temperatures during the inductive period when daylength exceeds about 14 hnurs. Even so, considerable variation in the intensity of flowering occurred both between sites and between individual tussocks at a site. In their flowering response the plants appear to be insensitive to differences in light intensity. Inflorescence development resembles that already described for the genus. It is increasingly delayed at higher altitudes, but is not subject to control by daylength. Floret size and seed weight decrease significantly with altitude. Seed set and viability are usually sati...

TI  - Ecology of mast-fruiting in three species of North American deciduous oaks.
PY  - 1993
AB  - We conducted an 8—yr study of flower and acorn production in three species of oak in east—central Missouri: white oak (Quercus alba), red oak (Q. rubra), and Black oak (Q. velutina). The goal was to evaluate whether mast—fruiting, the synchronous production of large seed crops followed by small seed crops, is simply a response to weather conditions or is actually an evolved reproductive strategy. In this paper, we address four specific questions: (1) Are annual fluctuations in acorn crop size the result of synchronous production of acorns by individuals? (2) Are large acorn crops the result of large flower crops and/or high survival of those flowers to mature fruit? (3) To what extent do weather variables account for variation in acorn production among years? (4) Does acorn crop size correlate negatively with prior acorn production? Red oak and white oak showed a greater degree of mast—fruiting than did black oak. Within a species, individuals tended to produce large acorn crops in the same years, but each species differed in which years they produced large crops. The size of a given acorn crop was determined by both flower abundance and survival of flowers to fruit. Principal components and multiple—regression analyses were used to describe the relationship between weather variables and acorn production. The first principal component explained the largest amount of the variation in black oak (R2 = 0.55) and the red oak (R2 = 0.89). In white oak, two principal components combined to explain 77% of the variation in acorn production. The weather variables that were associated with these principal components included spring temperature (positive effect) and summer drought (negative effect). Past acorn production had a major impact on the size of the current acorn crop, with each species showing a different pattern. In black oak, the current acorn crop was negatively correlated with the crop 3 yr prior but positively correlated with the crop 2 yr prior. In red oak, acorn crop size 1, 2, and 3 yr prior had negative correlations with current acorn crop, while acorn crop size 4 yr prior was positively correlated. In white oak, there were negative correlations between acorn crop size and crop size 1, 2, and 4 yr prior but a positive correlation with the acorn crop size 3 yr prior. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast—fruiting species must store resources during some years in order to produce a mast crop. We discuss the possibility that these three species may have inherent cycles of reproduction that are modified by the impact of weather conditions, black oak with 2—yr cycles, white oak with 3—yr cycles, and red oak with 4—yr cycles. We conclude that the patterns of acorn production for black oak, red oak, and white oak are not simply responses to weather events but are also a function of prior reproductive events. This suggests that masting is an evolved reproductive strategy.

TI  - Age-states, population structure, and seedling regeneration of Chionochloa pallens in Canterbury alpine grasslands, New Zealand
PY  - 1990
AB  - Age-states, population structure, and seedling regeneration of the grass Chionochloa pallens were in- vestigated in eight alpine grassland stands representing the range of canopy cover (ca. 5 - 75 %) and basal area (112 - 3889 m2/ha-1) in the headwaters of the Avoca catchment, Canterbury, New Zealand. In open-canopy stands (< 50 % canopy cover, < 2000 m2/ha-1 basal area) C. pallens individuals were clearly distinguishable. Rela- tionships between basal diameter, numberof tillers, height, and % crown death suggested four putative age-states: 'seedlings', 'juvenile tussocks', 'mature tussocks' and 'senescent tussocks'. Four types of population structure were identified depending on the proportions of seedlings and juvenile and mature tussocks. C. pallens seedlings were present in seven stands at densities ranging from 0.6 to 123.4 /m2. They were most frequent on microsites pro- tected from frost-heave by short herbaceous vegetation or litter, but with little competition from taller vegetation. Differences in seedling densities between stands partly reflected the proximity and abundance of seed sources and degree of protection from frost-heave. C. pallens population structures appear to be influenced by the fre- quency and magnitude of geomorphic disturbances and browsing by introduced animals.

TI  - Of Mice and Mast Ecological connections in eastern deciduous forests
PY  - 1996
AB  - popular characterization of ecological systems is that everything is connected to everything else. Although in some metaphysical sense it may be true that influences experienced by a particular species are transmitted to all other species in the ecosystem, such pervasive connections have not been demonstrated scientifically. Instead, the focus of community ecology has been on pairwise interactions between species. The paradigm has been that the determinants of community structure can be elucidated by studies of direct effects of populations on one or a few other populations (Kareiva 1994). To identify the role of predation or competition in structuring ecological communities, typically a predator or competitor is removed, and the responses of prey or other competitors are monitored (Connell 1983, Menge and Sutherland 1976, Schoener 1983, Sih et al. 1985). These studies reveal the importance of direct effects in ecological communities. However, such experiments often produce unexpected results, In oak forests, both

TI  - Annual seedfall variation in Nothofagus solandri (Fagaceae), Canterbury, New Zealand
PY  - 1990
AB  - Annual seed production was measured over 23 yr for a Nothofagus solandri stand at Mount Thomas Forest (foothill forest) and over 24 yr for three stands along an elevation gradient (montane to subalpine forest) in the Craigieburn Range, Canterbury, New Zealand. Total and viable annual seedfall were strongly correlated between stands, with highest correlations between adjacent stands. Periodicity of heavy seed production was greatest near timberline. For all stands, maximum seed viability occurred when total seed production exceeded ca. 7000 nuts ml2, indicating that pollination success was maximized in heavy seed years. Seed crop size was related to five predisposing variables. Mean daily temperature at the time of floral primordia formation (summer) was positively correlated with seed production. Seed crop size was negatively correlated with the previous 3 years' seedfall in montane and subalpine forest, but only with the previous year's seedfall in foothill forest. This suggests that high elevation forest needs a longer recovery period than lower elevation forest. Increased precipitation and extreme minimum temperature at the time of flowering were negatively correlated with seed production in montane and subalpine forest, but not in foothill forest. Increased daily temperatures at the time of flowering were positively correlated with seed production in montane and subalpine forest. Multiple linear regression showed that these five variables accounted for most variation in total and viable seed production within each stand. For the Craigieburn elevation gradient, these variables accounted for less variation with increasing elevation, indicating that the predictability of seed production declined near the elevation limit of the species.

PY  - 1989
AB  - Population size, local survival and territoriality of Nuthatches were studied in two years with and two years without beech mast, with additional data from a fifth year with presumably no mast. Population size was not larger in summers preceding autumns with beech mast than in summers followed by no mast. Local survival in autumn was higher in beech mast years for juveniles, but not for adults, and the effect of beech mast was more pronounced in juveniles occupying territories with beeches. Local winter survival was not higher in years with than in years without beech mast. The size of the autumn population seems to be adjusted to the food supply through higher rates of starvation or emigration of juveniles occupying low-quality territories in years without beech mast, and not by defence of larger territories.

TI  - Effect of climate change on mast‐seeding species: frequency of mass flowering and escape from specialist insect seed predators
PY  - 1998
AB  - Global surface temperatures are expected to increase by several degrees in the next century, with potentially large but poorly understood impacts on ecological interactions. Here we propose potential effects of increased temperatures on ecologically dominant New Zealand grasses (Chionochloa spp.) that mass flower and mast seed. Twenty-two years’ data from five masting Chionochloa species in New Zealand showed that the cue for heavy flowering was unusually high temperature in the summer of the year before flowering. Attack by predispersal insect seed predators was much reduced in mast years, apparently because predator populations were satiated. Increased temperatures would greatly decrease interannual variation in Chionochloa flowering, allowing seed predator populations to increase and potentially to devastate the seed crop annually. Similar responses are likely in masting species worldwide. This previously unrecognized effect of global warming could have widespread impacts on temperate ecosystems.

TI  - INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF FIRE AND MICROHABITAT ON PLANTS OF FLORIDA SCRUB
PY  - 1998
AB  - Fire, microhabitat, and their interactions affect Florida scrub ecosystems and their plant species. Concepts of vegetation change in the Florida upland landscape have followed successional theory, with recent models emphasizing the resilience of Florida scrub to fire and the interactive effects of the vegetation and fire regime. We extend these models by incorporating greater complexity in vegetation types and emphasizing that departures from modal fire frequencies may alter vegetation. In particular, fire exclusion leads to structural and compositional changes that, in turn, alter vegetation changes following the reintroduction of fire. Individual species responses to fire can be categorized by the demographic mechanisms of the response (e.g., resprouting, clonal growth, seedling recruitment) and by typical patterns of abundance during fire-free intervals. Various types of scrub differ in these life-history traits. For example, xeric rosemary scrub supports more herbs, more endemics, more specialized spe...

TI  - Annual Variability in Seed Production by Woody Plants and the Masting Concept: Reassessment of Principles and Relationship to Pollination and Seed Dispersal
PY  - 1998
AB  - By analyzing 296 published and unpublished data sets describing annual variation in seed output by 144 species of woody plants, this article addresses the following questions. Do plant species naturally fall into distinct groups corresponding to masting and nonmasting habits? Do plant populations generally exhibit significant bimodality in annual seed output? Are there significant relationships between annual variability in seed production and pollination and seed dispersal modes, as predicted from economy of scale considerations? We failed to identify distinct groups of species with contrasting levels of annual variability in seed output but did find evidence that most polycarpic woody plants seem to adhere to alternating supra-annual schedules consisting of either high or low reproduction years. Seed production was weakly more variable among wind-pollinated taxa than animal-pollinated ones. Plants dispersed by mutualistic frugivores were less variable than those dispersed by either inanimate means or animals that predominantly behave as seed predators. We conclude that there are no objective reasons to perpetuate the concept of mast fruiting in the ecological literature as a shorthand to designate a distinct biological phenomenon. Associations between supra-annual variability in seed output and pollination and seed dispersal methods suggest the existence of important reproductive correlates that demand further investigation.

TI  - Comparison of biomass recovery after fire of a seeder (Ceratiola ericoides) and a sprouter (Quercus inopina) species from south-central Florida
PY  - 1986
AB  - Scrub oak (Quercus inopina) and Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides) are two evergreen shrubs which dominate adjacent stands of Florida scrub at Archbold Biological Station in S-central Florida. After fire the clonal oak resprouts from a rhizome, whereas rosemary is killed and must reestablish from seed. To compare biomass allocation and recovery after fire in this seeder and sprouter species, we excavated eight oak clones and 18 rosemary shrubs representing the range of sizes present. Regression equations to estimate biomass from measured dimensions were developed from the harvested shrubs and used to obtain stand biomass of each species at sites of increasing age postfire. Aboveground vs. belowground biomass allocation was 30:700% in oak and 80:200% in rosemary. Percent of total biomass allocated to leaves is similar in the largest shrubs of each species (8-10%). After ca. 30 years postfire the biomass of the rosemary stands (1400 g/m2) nearly equalled the average biomass of the oak stands (1500 g/m2).

Structural changes and successional relationships of five Florida Lake Wales Ridge plant communities. Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 111: 8-18. 1984.-Vegetation of five southern Lake Wales Ridge associations was sampled at Archbold Biological Station, Lake Placid, Florida, in permanent nested quadrats in each of the associations in 1969 and 1979. These associations have been free of fire for over 50 years. Quadrats were sampled for species composition, density, and growth parameters of herbs, shrubs, and trees, and also for percent litter coverage and depth. Several trends were apparent in all the associations examined: (1) substantial thinning of herb and shrub layers with disappearance of several shade-intolerant species; (2) an increase in tree canopy coverage despite extensive shrub thinning, as few trees died in the 10-year study period; (3) an increase in shrub and tree species richness and diversity; (4) increase in litter coverage and depth; and (5) a slow rate of succession, not appreciably different among the five communities. Pairwise comparisons of the 1969 and 1979 Horn's Indices from different communities did not reveal support for the successional relationships proposed in the literature.

Torrey Bot. Club 116: 215-228. 1989.-Fruit quality was examined by species, vegetation association, soil parameters, and time since fire. Of the nine species examined, Carya floridana fruits had the highest concentrations of energy, protein, fat, fiber, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, copper, and zinc and had the highest digestibility. Acorns of the red oaks studied (Quercus myrtifolia, Q. inopina, Q. laevis) had higher energy and fat concentrations and greater total digestibility than acorns of the white oaks examined (Q. geminata, Q. minima, Q. chapmanii). Palmetto (Sabal etonia, Serenoa repens) drupes were high in fiber, ash, and concentrations of potassium, sulfur (Sabal etonia), and sodium (Serenoa repens). Fruit quality was not correlated with site soil characteristics. Although fruit quality changes correlated with time since fire in some species, the changes differed by species and vegetation association. During ripening, hickory fruits increased concentrations of protein and fat but decreased levels of energy and fiber. In contrast, acorns increased energy concentrations and the amounts of digestible carbohydrate. Palmetto fruits decreased in energy, protein, and fiber concentrations during ripening. These results are useful in understanding preferences among frugivorous animals.

TI  - Within- and Among-Tree Variation in Flower and Fruit Production in Two Species of Carya (Juglandaceae)
PY  - 1989
AB  - The patterns of variability in the production of staminate inflorescences, pistillate flowers, and fruits for Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch and C. tomentosa (Poir.) Nutt. at Hutcheson Memorial Forest (Somerset County, New Jersey) were examined over a four-year period. We sought to determine 1) the patterns of variability in flowering and fruiting (within-trees, among-trees, and between-years), 2) if variable flowering might account for observed nut-bearing patterns, and 3) what were the relative contributions of intrinsic (genetic) and/or extrinsic (environmental) factors in determining flower production and fruit set. In general, our fine-scale analysis of shoots within canopies did not reveal a distinct mast fruiting pattern. While the number of male and female flowers varied significantly (among trees and between years), fruit set was not markedly affected. Variability of flowering and fruiting among shoots within trees was low. Both flowering and fruiting were observed to have a strong genetic and/or microenvironmental basis; however, flowering appeared more plastic and thus more sensitive to yearly environmental vagaries than did fruiting. Favorable environmental conditions at the time of flower differentiation may result in increased flower production; but, this does not necessarily result in increased fruit set. Many pistillate flowers abscise around the time of pollination and fertilization, apparently adjusting fruit set to available shoot resources. Approximately 50% of the pistillate flowers of both species fail to set fruit. Overall, individual trees exhibit their own flowering and fruiting schedules, suggesting the need to account for this level of variability in future studies of mast fruiting.

TI  - MAST SEEDING IN PERENNIAL PLANTS: Why, How, Where?
PY  - 2002
AB  - ▪ Abstract For many years biologists have debated whether mast seeding (the synchronous intermittent production of large seed crops in perennial plants) results from weather conditions or is an evolved plant reproductive strategy. In this review, we analyze the evidence for the underlying causes of masting. In the absence of selection for higher or lower variability, plants will vary in tandem with the environment (resource matching). Two selective factors often favor the evolution of masting: increased pollination efficiency in wind-pollinated species, and satiation of seed predators. Other factors select against masting, including animal pollination and frugivore dispersal. A survey of 570 masting datasets shows that wind-pollinated species had higher seed production coefficients of variation (CVs) than biotically pollinated ones. Frugivore-dispersed species had low CVs whereas predator-dispersed plants had high CVs, consistent with gaining benefits from predator satiation rather than dispersal. The glo...

TI  - Predator satiation and extreme mast seeding in 11 species of Chionochloa (Poaceae)
PY  - 2000
AB  - Variation in annual flowering effort is described for 16 long datasets from 11 species of Chionochloa (Poaceae) in New Zealand. All populations exhibited extreme mast seeding. The most variable species was C. crassiuscula (coefficient of variation, CV = 3.02) over 26 years at Takahe Valley, Fiordland, which is the highest published CV we know of worldwide. The other populations also had high CVs (lowest CV = 1.42, mean CV = 1.84) which were higher than for other well-studied genera such as Picea, Pinus and Quercus. There were also frequent years of zero flowering (mean across all populations was 37.2% zero years; maximum 53% for C. rubra and C. crassiuscula over 19 years) whereas zero years are rare in other published masting datasets. Flowering was highly synchronous among species within a site (mean r = 0.886), and also (though significantly less so) among sites. Among sites, synchrony was not significantly higher within-species (mean r = 0.711) than between-species (r = 0.690). Warm summer temperatures led to heavy flowering the following summer. Flowering synchrony increased with increasing synchrony in local deseasonalised summer temperatures, and decreased with increasing distance between sites. Mast seeding has been shown in Chionochloa to reduce losses to specialist flower or seed predators. Among-species synchrony may be adaptive if species share a common seed predator. Developing seeds of at least 10 Chionochloa species are attacked by larvae of an undescribed cecidomyiid. In Takahe Valley, where masting is most pronounced, cecidomyiids attacked all six Chionochloa species in all four years studied. Mean annual losses were almost constant (10.0 to 13.4%) while flowering effort varied 100-fold. The invariant losses are consistent with other evidence that the cecidomyiid may have extended diapause, which would make it harder to satiate by mast seeding. We hypothesise that one possible factor favouring such extremely high levels of mast seeding in Chionochloa is that its seed predator is very hard to satiate.

TI  - Mast Flowering and Semelparity in Bamboos: The Bamboo Fire Cycle Hypothesis
PY  - 1999
AB  - Mast flowering is the phenomenon of massive flowering and fruiting at intermittent intervals that is synchronized within a species across large areas. Most masting species are iteroparous, flowering and fruiting multiple times during their life span (Silvertown 1980). Bamboos are an exception as mast flowering is largely restricted to semelparous species that flower once and die (Janzen 1976). Additionally, whereas most mast-flowering species produce seed crops on a cycle of 3–7 yr (Silvertown 1980), bamboos have intermast intervals that are typically an order of magnitude longer. The earliest explanation for mast flowering in bamboo was that of external controls on physiological processes by available resources such as rainfall (Brandis 1899), the resource-matching hypothesis. Today, this bottom-up hypothesis largely has been replaced by top-down explanations involving pollinators and predators (Kelly 1994). It is widely accepted that the selective force driving the evolution of masting in bamboos is “predator satiation” (Janzen 1976; Gadgil and Prasad 1984; Kelly 1994). This hypothesis proposes that irregular fruiting cycles are sufficient disequilibrium to inhibit seed predators from main-

TI  - PATTERNS OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN WILDFLOWER POPULATIONS OF FIELDS AND WOODS
PY  - 1979
AB  - Fifty-two populations of fifty species of wildflowers characteristic of either field or deciduous forest were analyzed to determine pattens of biomass allocation to component organs. These populations' allocation patterns were used to determine generalized allocation patterns of the herb component of earlier (field) and later (deciduous forest) secondary successional communities. The following patterns were determined: (1) The proportion of dry matter allocated to seed reproductive organs was greater in field populations than in woods populations; (2) The herbs of woodland habitats allocated a greater proportion of their resources to leaves and belowground organs than field habitat herbs; (3) The field annuals allocated a greater proportion of their resources to reproduction than field perennials; (4) Introduced species showed a higher reproductive allocation than native species of fields; (5) Regression analysis showed strong correlations of component organ biomass to total biomass and belowground biomass to shoot biomass.

TI  - Alternate bearing, predator satiation and seedling recruitment in Quercus robur L.
PY  - 1995
AB  - 1 We investigated the relationship between seed production and seedling recruitment in Quercus robur in order to determine whether oak recruitment was seed-limited, herbivore-limited or microsite-limited. Over a 15-year period, Q. robur showed a pattern of alternate bearing, with significant (but not complete) synchrony between individual trees at several sites in south-east England. 2 Seedling recruitment was assessed in three ways: by annual destructive sampling, by monitoring permanent quadrats, and by ageing destructive samples of saplings using basal ring counts. 3 Seedling recruitment was closely correlated with the size of the acorn crop in some habitats but not others. In Sunningdale, where a competition-free seed bed was available every year and where seed predators were relatively scarce, oak seedlings appeared almost every year, and three peak densities of seedling recruitment followed three peaks of acorn production during the period 1985-92. In Silwood Park, where rabbits were abundant, there was little seedling recruitment except within rabbit exclosures and then only in years of peak acorn production. In Windsor Great Park, rabbit densities were lower and seedling recruitment was higher than at Silwood Park, but the association between seedling recruitment and acorn production could not be established with confidence because of imprecision in ageing the saplings. 4 Rates of acorn loss to invertebrate seed predators were broadly consistent with the hypothesis of predator satiation; low acorn crops suffered a higher percentage mortality than large acorn crops. The two principal acorn-feeding insects (the alien cynipid gall wasp Andricus quercuscalicis and the native weevil Curculio glandium) killed between 30% and 90% of the acorn crop in given years and between 0% and 100% of the acorn crop on individual trees. Vertebrate herbivores (principally rabbits and wood mice) destroyed most of the sound acorns in low years, removing experimentally placed acorns within 24 h. 5 The effectiveness of alternate bearing as a defence against short-lived, specialist insect herbivores and long-lived, generalist vertebrate herbivores is discussed. The evidence presently available does not allow us to discriminate between the competing hypotheses that alternate bearing is an evolved, antipredator strategy on the part of the oaks, or a constraint imposed by limited resource availability within the trees. 6 We conclude that the relationship between seed production and seedling recruitment in Quercus robur is variable from site to site: oak recruitment is seed-limited in open sites where vertebrate herbivores are scarce, microsite-limited beneath a dense forest canopy, but herbivore-limited in other sites, especially those where rabbits are abundant.

TI  - Relation of ramet size to acorn production in five oak species of xeric upland habitats in south-central Florida
PY  - 2002
AB  - This study examined variation in two components of acorn production. Percentage of bearing ramets (stems) and number of acorns per bearing ramet were examined in five clonal oaks in three xeric habitats of south-central peninsular Florida in relation to ramet size within and between species and vegetative associations. Counts of acorns on two white oaks (Quercus chapmanii and Q. geminata) and three red oaks (Q. inopina, Q. laevis, and Q. myrtifolia) were conducted annually from 1969 to 1996 (except in 1991) on permanent grids in southern ridge sandhill, sand pine scrub, and scrubby flatwoods associations at the Archbold Biological Station, Florida, USA. Percentage of bearing individuals and mean number of acorns per bearing individual increased with increasing ramet size for all species across all vegetation associations. However, in Q. geminata and Q. myrtifolia, acorn production declined in the largest size class (>3.2 m), implying that larger individuals of these clonal species may become senescent. All oak species in sand pine scrub, which had a nearly closed overstory, had lower frequencies of bearing oaks and mean numbers of acorns compared with similar-sized individuals of the same species in the more open-canopied southern ridge sandhill and scrubby flatwoods associations, suggesting light limitation. The annual production of acorns by a given oak species was correlated across vegetative associations and annual acorn production of oak species was correlated for species within the same section. Intermediate-size class oaks contributed the most acorns per unit area, suggesting that stands managed with short fire-return times will provide fewer acorns to wildlife than stands managed to produce more variable distributions of oak size classes. However, our study suggests that long-unburned stands, such as those studied here, will maintain relatively constant levels of acorn production as a consequence of ramet replacement within the clones of these shrubby oaks to create a variable distribution of size classes. Of the oak species studied, Q. myrtifolia had the highest acorn production and the smallest acorns, while Q. laevis had the lowest acorn production and the largest acorns, suggesting an allocation trade-off between acorn numbers and size.

TI  - Patterns of Annual Seed Production by Northern Hemisphere Trees: A Global Perspective
PY  - 2000
AB  - We tested whether annual seed production (masting or mast fruiting) in Northern Hemisphere trees is an evolved strategy or a consequence of resource tracking by comparing masting patterns with those of annual rainfall and mean summer temperatures, two environmental variables likely to correlate with available resources. There were generally significant negative autocorrelations between the seed crop in year x and year [Formula: see text] (year [Formula: see text] in species of Quercus requiring 2 yr to mature acorns), as expected if resources are depleted in mast years in part by switching resources from growth to reproduction. Spatial autocorrelation in annual seed production generally declined with distance but was statistically significant over large geographic areas. Variability in annual seed production was relatively high and inversely correlated with latitude and generally not bimodally distributed. Patterns of spatial autocorrelation in annual rainfall and summer temperatures are generally similar to those exhibited by annual seed production, and relative variability in annual rainfall is also inversely correlated with latitude. However, these environmental variables exhibit distinctly different patterns of temporal autocorrelation, are much less variable, and are more normally distributed than annual seed production. Combined with the inverse relationship between growth and reproduction previously documented, these results support the hypothesis that variability in annual seed production is an evolved strategy and that annual seed production is more or less normally distributed rather than an all-or-none phenomenon.

TI  - MASTING IN ANIMAL-DISPERSED PINES FACILITATES SEED DISPERSAL
PY  - 2002
AB  - Masting increases the efficiency of wind pollination and satiates seed predators, but there is little evidence that masting facilitates seed dispersal by animals. Masting in pines was studied over three field seasons by simulating seed crops in synchrony (mast years, autumn 1998 and 1999) or out of synchrony (non-mast year, autumn 2000) with the local population. Rodents removed simulated wind-dispersed Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) seeds significantly more rapidly in mast years than in the non-mast year. Radioisotopes were used to follow the fates of individual pine seeds taken from three source trees. Rodents cached nearly all experimental seeds in mast and non-mast years, making 562 caches in 1998, 510 caches in 1999, and 1034 caches in 2000. Mean dispersal distances of seeds in primary caches were 5.9 and 4.6 m (28.6% and 22.1%) farther in the two mast years than in the non-mast year. Rodents often excavated cached seeds and moved them to new sites (secondary caching). During mast years, some seeds were found in as many as three cache sites, but during the non-mast year, the level of secondary caching approximately tripled, with some seeds being found in five or six separate cache sites. Large seed crops were associated with reduced secondary caching of seeds, reduced seed consumption, and greater seed survival in the following spring. Animal-mediated seed dispersal may be a selective force, along with predator satiation and increased efficiency of wind pollination, driving temporal variation in seed production in some large-seeded pines.

TI  - Post-fire recovery of acorn production by four oak species in southern ridge sandhill association in south-central Florida.
PY  - 2002
AB  - We examined post-fire recovery of two components of acorn production (percentage of bearing ramets [stems] and number of acorns per bearing ramet) for four species of oaks in southern ridge sandhill vegetation in south-central peninsular Florida. Annual counts of acorns on two white oaks (Quercus chapmanii and Q. geminata) and two red oaks (Q. laevis and Q. myrtifolia) were conducted annually (except in 1991) on two 2.7-ha grids from 1969 to 1998. A prescribed burn was conducted on one of the grids in May 1993. Newly sprouted ramets of both white oaks produced acorns during the first year following the fire, whereas red oaks required 3 yr (Q. myrtifolia )o r 4y r (Q. laevis) to produce acorns. The difference in the timing of post-fire acorn production between the white and red oak species reflected the difference in the number of years from flower bud initiation to mature acorns in the two groups, with the additional year-long lag in Q. laevis probably attributable to the fact that it is typically a tree rather than a shrub species. The data suggested that percentage of bearing ramets in the smallest size class of the two white oak species was markedly lower in the burned than unburned grid in the first year of post-fire acorn production and higher in the fifth year, but these trends were not evident for the red oaks. Among all four species, differences between mean number of acorns in burned and unburned grids were significant in only two cases (the largest size class of both white oak species in the fifth year). There was no evidence of recruitment from acorns on the burned grid, possibly due to the rapid redevelopment of the shrub layer because of low mortality of the extensive clonal root systems. Rapid post-fire recovery of acorn production in xeric fire-prone habitats is presumably the result of selection to increase the probability of recovery and persistence following sufficiently intense fires that result in high oak mortality. The timing and magnitude of post-fire acorn production in sandhill and other xeric Florida associations has a potential impact on a wide variety of insects, birds, and mammals that feed on acorns, as well as on the species with which they interact.

TI  - EVALUATING THE WIND POLLINATION BENEFITS OF MAST SEEDING
PY  - 2001
AB  - We developed a conceptual model for evaluating the benefits of wind pollination to mast-flowering species. The benefit that a plant population gains from mast flowering via increased wind pollination efficiency was predicted from how far pollination efficiency at mean seed crop size falls below the maximum. Species were most likely to benefit from mast seeding if mean reproductive effort in the field gave an intermediate level of pollination efficiency, regardless of the cost of unpollinated female structures. To quantify the benefits of different degrees of mast flowering, a simulation model was used to alter the seed production coefficient of variation (cv) and to calculate its effects on weighted mean pollination efficiency. The model was applied to seven real data sets for five species with pollination benefits from masting that ranged from relatively small (Chionochloa pallens), to moderate (Dacrydium cupressinum, Betula alleghaniensis), to large (Nothofagus solandri, N. menziesii).

Many studies have reported higher seed production coefficients of variation at higher altitudes and latitudes within a species. Our model showed that higher coefficients of variation are favored by reduced mean seed output per plant at higher altitudes. Data for N. solandri at three altitudes in one site showed much higher pollination benefits from masting at higher altitudes. Reduced plant density (e.g., through fragmentation), which also lowers mean flowering effort per unit area, resulted in large increases in masting benefits in N. solandri, but only small increases in C. pallens. These contrasting results were primarily due to differences between the two species in mean reproductive effort vs. wind pollination efficiency, rather than to differences in the effects of fragmentation and altitude.

The relative effects of masting on pollination, insect seed predation, and bird seed predation were modeled in B. alleghaniensis. Masting produced a small economy of scale from insect predator satiation, but an almost equivalent diseconomy of scale resulted from increased levels of bird seed predation. Efficiency of wind pollination improved moderately with increasing cv, providing some overall benefits from masting in this species. Accordingly, we propose that masting can be favored by either one dominant economy of scale (such as wind pollination efficiency in N. solandri or predator satiation in C. pallens), or a balance among several factors (such as pollination, predator satiation, and predator attraction in B. alleghaniensis). We predict that, in the absence of any selective benefits or disadvantages of masting, plants would be expected to have coefficients of variation in the range 0.85–1.35.

TI  - Gypsy moth effects on mast production
PY  - 1990
AB  - Gypsy moth outbreaks can have drastic effects on many forest resources and uses. Because the gypsy moth prefers oak foliage, oak stands are the most susceptible to defoliation and resultant damage. The value of oak mast for many wildlife species is high. The high carbohydrate content of acorns provides the energy necessary for winter survival. Loss of mast crops due to direct and indirect effects of gypsy moth defoliation may result in large-scale reductions in wildlife habitat and food sources.

TI  - Mammalian Seed Dispersal of Pignut Hickory during Three Fruiting Seasons
PY  - 1983
AB  - Seed removal by mammalian predator—dispersers was monitored weekly for Carya glabra (Juglandacea) in an aok—hickory forest of southern Michigan during three fruiting seasons. It was expected that dispersal patterns would be influenced by annual variation in seed crop size. The prediction is that large crop size enables some seeds to escape predation through satiation of dispersal agents. Within a given year, neither size of crops for individual trees nor average weekly nut fall significantly affected weekly proportion of hickory nuts removed. However, among years, proportional disappearance of nuts was slowest during the year with highest seed prodution. During all three seasons, animals removed only a small percentage for nuts, but this pattern was not the results of satiation. Instead, it is more likely due to selective removal of viable nuts. Because virtually all viable nuts were removed from the parent tree, it is concluded that dispersal in hickories is effective in preventing seedling establishment under the parent tree. However, it might be at the cost of high seed predation. Although predator satiation before dispersal was not demonstrated even during the highest seed—producing year, it is possible that postdispersal satiation may have occurred. Results of this study illustrate a relationship between seed production and seed removal that may be found in other nut—producing trees.

TI  - Effects of fire on long-unburned Florida uplands
PY  - 1996
AB  - Abstract. The widespread suppression of fire during the 20th century has created extensive areas of fire-prone ecosystems that are in long-unburned condition. Plant species of flatwoods and scrubby flatwoods (= oak scrub) in the southeastern USA possess adaptations that facilitate resprouting, clonal spread, or seeding following fire. While the majority of the woody species of these associations can persist for long periods without fire, fire suppression reduces the populations of ephemeral herbs. Long-unburned (> 35 yr) flatwoods and scrubby flatwoods were burned after five annual vegetation censuses. Both stands were resampled five times over a >8-yr recovery period. One recently burned (<20 yr) flatwoods and two recently burned scrubby flatwoods were censused prior to fire and were recensused over a 5-yr or 11-yr period following fire depending on the stand. In spite of the variety of recovery strategies and time since fire, there were limited changes in the compositions and structures of post-burn stands compared to their preburn states. Detrended Correspondence Analysis showed that recently burned stands returned to preburn states within 1–2 yr. However, the reintroduction of a single fire to long-unburned stands did not restore the populations of herbs typical of recently burned stands. Our results suggest that a single fire may not be effective in restoring flatwoods and scrubby flatwoods that have experienced fire suppression to states more characteristic of recently burned stands.

TI  - The Advantage of Mast Years for Wind Pollination
PY  - 1990
AB  - A model is developed to demonstrate how mast years increase the effectiveness of wind pollination. The model is based on seven assumptions relating to the timing and distribution of reproductive effort. Field data from reproduction in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) demonstrate how relaxing some of the assumptions influences the effectiveness of wind pollination. Relaxing five of the assumptions raises or lowers, but does not eliminate, the advantage of increased fecundity resulting from having the extreme variation in annual reproduction characteristic of species with mast years, If two of the assumptions are relaxed, the model quickly loses relevance. These assumptions are that (1) both male and female reproductive efforts vary synchronously and (2) the cost of producing a female is nearly the same whether she is fertilized or not. These two assumptions tend to be true for both the gymnosperms and angiosperms of boreal forests and false for the wind-pollinated angiosperms and one gymnosperm of temperate...

TI  - Growth Form and Reproductive Effort in Goldenrods (Solidago, Compositae)
PY  - 1973
AB  - Based on Gadgil and Solbrig's (1972) ideas concerning the distribution of resources between the reproductive and vegetative tissues, it is predicted that the ratio of reproductive biomass/total biomass (reproductive effort) will decline with the increasing successional maturity of the community. This prediction was confirmed in field studies utilizing four species of goldenrods. The distribution of resources among the various vegetative tissues should depend on the nature of the limiting factor and the growth form of the dominant plants competing for this limiting factor. Thus, it is predicted that the ratio of stem biomass/total biomass will decline and that of leaf biomass/total biomass will increase for light-limited plant populations as the growth form of competitors changes from being one of the same stature (herbs with herbs) to being one of greater stature (herbs with trees). These two predictions are likewise confirmed in goldenrods. The problem of how these differences in the distribution of reso...

TI  - Acorn Production by Oaks in Central Coastal California: Variation within and among Years
PY  - 1994
AB  - We measured acorn production by individual oaks of five different species at Hastings Reservation in central coastal California between 1980 and 1991. Variation in acorn production was considerable both within and among years and was generally un- correlated between species. Compared to expected values, variance within years in the size of acorn crops was small, while variance among years was high. Crop failures occurred fairly frequently and large crops in successive years were observed, but no more than expected by chance. Individual trees masted at species-specific intervals, but these patterns did not result in regular masting cycles at the population level. We compared these patterns to predictions of four hypotheses for the evolution of seed production patterns. Observations did not support the hypotheses that production patterns track resource availability (the "resource matching" hypothesis) or that they have evolved to attract seed dispersers (the "seed dispersal" hypothesis). However, they are generally consistent with two additional hypotheses, that masting in these wind-pollinated species evolved because of a proportional increase in fertilization and seed set during mast years (the "wind pollination" hypothesis) and that masting has evolved to maximize the prob- ability of avoiding predation via predator satiation (the "predator satiation" hypothesis).

TI  - Rainfall and flowering synchrony in a tropical variable selection on the flowering time of Erythroxylum havanense shrub
PY  - 1995
AB  - Summary We tested the adaptive significance of flowering synchrony by means of a quantitative analysis of selection and by flowering induction experiments with the deciduous shrub Erythroxylum havanense. Temporal schedules of flower and fruit production were determined for a local population (in three sites) in a Mexican seasonal forest for 2 years (1987-1988). The consequences of natural variation in flowering time (flowering initiation day) on maternal reproductive success (fecundity) were evaluated. We observed high levels of inter- and intraindividual flowering synchrony in 1987, but not in 1988 and this contrast was related to differences in rainfall patterns between the two years. A significant proportion (15.4%) of the phenotypic variation in flowering initiation day was accounted for by environmental variance. The expression of phenotypic variance of flowering time and, consequently, the opportunity for selection to act, are controlled by annual variation in rainfall. Despite the between-year difference in flowering synchrony, we detected a relatively intense directional selection on flowering initiation day in both years, but selection coefficients were of opposite sign (standardized directional gradients were -0.326 and 0.333 for 1987 and 1988, respectively). For both years there was a significant relationship between individual relative fitness and the number of neighbouring flowering plants in a given day, suggesting positive frequency-dependent selection.

TI  - THEORY OF MAST REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS: STORAGE-SIZE DEPENDENT STRATEGY.
PY  - 1996
AB  - The amount of available resource can be considered to restrict mast seeding behavior in plants, regardless of the cause of masting itself. The reproductive strategy of a plant that has stopped growing, but continues to maintain a constant size, is based on the allocation of assimilated resources between reproduction and storage. If both plant death and population growth rates are constant, the plant strategy is dependent only on its own storage size. Conditions for the evolution of mast reproduction were analyzed under both constant and varying environments, from the view point of storage-size dependent strategy, which is influenced by three parameters: the advantage coefficient of mast seeding, β; the cost coefficient of delayed seeding, γ; and the assimilation rate, P. The model indicated that: (1) mast seeding evolves only with a greater than linear increase in reproductive success with effort (β > 1) under both constant and varying environments; (2) in mast seeding, a critical storage size, Sc *, occurs, above which plants utilize all storage for reproduction; (3) in a constant environment, Sc * increases with increasing β and P and/or decreasing γ; (4) concomitant with (3), an intermasting period, τ, also increases with increasing β and decreasing 7, but is independent of P; (5) in a varying environment, Sc * and the average of τ increase with increasing variance of the assimilation rate, P; and (6) concomitant with (5), the intermasting period has a certain probability distribution. In addition, reproductive synchrony within the population and the relationship between mast seeding and species diversity are discussed.

TI  - Twenty years of vegetation change in five long-unburned Florida plant communities
PY  - 1993
AB  - Rates and directions of change over a 20-yr interval in five long-unburned (> 60 yr) plant communities were stud- ied using multivariate analyses and compositional vectors. The study sites were located in fire and summer-drought adapted, xerophytic vegetation with many endemics on acidic, nutrient-poor, sandy soils in south-central peninsular Florida. Sizes of individual stems from 72 sets of nested permanent quadrats were measured in 1969, 1979, and 1989. Patterns of vegetation change differed by community. Flatwood and bayhead quadrats showed rapid increases in densities and basal areas of Persea borbonia (red bay). In the southern ridge sandhill community, evergreen clonal Quercus species (oaks) and Pinus clausa (sand pine) increased in dominance and grasses declined. Oaks (especially Q. geminata) also increased in importance in scrubby flatwoods. Sand pine scrub was relatively stable in composition, but experienced marked structural changes due to substantial sand pine mortal- ity (18 % during 1969-1979, 39 % during 1979-1989). Com- positional changes in the absence of fire were greatest whereas structural changes were least in southern ridge sandhill and scrubby flatwoods, both communities which normally receive frequent, recurrent fire. Compositional changes were lowest in sand pine scrub, which is normally infrequently burned. Classic successional patterns such as species replacement, decreases in density, and increases in basal area were gener- ally lacking. Tree densities increased in two of four communi- ty types (southern ridge sandhill, scrubby flatwoods); while basal area declined in the flatwoods/bayhead and sand pine scrub sites. Directions of compositional vectors included di- vergent, opposing, and complex patterns, suggesting vegeta- tion change in the absence of fire has a strong stochastic component.

TI  - ACORN HARVESTING BY FLORIDA SCRUB JAYS
PY  - 1989
AB  - We documented numbers of acorns eaten, cached, and retrieved by Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens), through one full annual cycle and part of another, in an oak scrub habitat characterized by abundant and reliable annual acorn crops. Jays consumed acorns during all months, with highest consumption from September through February and lowest in June and July. From August through December, most acorns consumed by jays were picked directly from shrubs; during the remaining 7 mo, acorns were recovered from ground stores. Acorn caching occurred throughout the fall, peaking in September and October. Data pooled across sex and age classes suggest that individual jays, on average, each cached between 6500 and 8000 acorns during fall of 1974. Only about one-third of those acorns were recovered later. Intact acorns recovered by Scrub Jays during fall usually were reburied, but by summer most recovered acorns were con- sumed. Acorn crops in the study area exhibit moderate annual variation but no crop failures. Acorns are available in substantial numbers every year, permitting Florida Scrub Jay territories to serve without fail as year-round warehouses of stored acorns. Those stores provide resources to carry group members through seasons of low arthropod availability, and perhaps facilitate delayed dispersal by juveniles. Use of a habitat characterized by relatively large and dependable annual acorn crops that are evenly dispersed, coupled with caching behavior, may contribute to the maintenance of permanent territoriality and co- operative breeding in this population.

TI  - On the Evolution of Masting Behavior in Trees: Predation or Weather?
PY  - 1992
AB  - We address the problem of parasite-mediated selection for the evolution of masting (episodic, synchronized seed production) in trees. As a strategy, masting works very well in swamping seed predators when it is common in the population. It is not clear, however, how such a behavior can invade a nonmasting ancestral population when parasites and predators are kept at high densities by an annual abundance of fruits. We demonstrate that rare masting behavior enjoys higher fitness than nonmasting, as long as seed parasites are aggregated and all masters are perfectly synchronized. We develop a dynamic optimization model that demonstrates that synchronized fluctuations in seed production can develop as long as there is some year-to-year variation in weather-mediated resource availability. We suggest that synchronized fluctuations in seed production must exist before any predator or parasite can select for masting.

TI  - Stem turnover in the Rhizomatous scrub Oak, Quercus inopina, from south-central Florida
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract Average length of time between fires is thought to limit shrub height of some Florida scrubs which has been found to exceed 3 m within 30 to 40 y, a height at which these scrubs no longer support the Florida scrub jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) and possibly other rare species endemic to this vegetation type. We hypothesize, however, that stem lifespan, rather than the average fire return interval, limits the height attained by Quercus inopina, a dominant shrub oak endemic to scrubs on the Lake Wales Ridge in south-central Florida. To determine stem longevity and height growth, the perimeters of 56 stem clusters at nodes on the rhizomes of Q. inopina were outlined with wire flags in four scrub stands at Archbold Biological Station in south-central Florida and all stems in each cluster tagged. Height growth and survival of 448 stems were followed for 9–10 y, along with that of any new stem sprouts appearing within the perimeters of the marked clusters during this time. Between 80 and 90% of the init...

In these species we observed plateau effects when obtaining pressure-volume curves. Such effects may cause significant interpretational errors in osmotic potentials and elastic moduli, and be confounded with seasonal changes in these parameters.

TI  - Mast seeding in Abies balsamea, Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis in an old growth, cold temperate forest of north‐eastern North America
PY  - 1999
AB  - 1 Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the phenomenon of masting or mast seeding, i.e. the supra-annual, periodic production of a large number of seeds in long-lived plants. Some of these hypotheses deal with the proximate causes of masting (e.g. the climate hypothesis) but others are concerned mostly with ultimate, evolutionary explanations (e.g. the pollination efficiency hypothesis).



2 The seed production of three tree species, Abies balsamea, Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis, was followed over a 7-year period in an old-growth, cold temperate forest of north-eastern North America. The main objectives were to determine the extent of interannual variations in seed production, to investigate the relationship between viable and potential seed crop and crop efficiency, and to explore the effects of climate on seed production.



3 Potential and viable seed production varied significantly among years for all three species. However, the timing of dispersal remained the same regardless of the level of seed production.



4 Seed rain was spatially less heterogeneous in years of high seed production, suggesting that most trees were reproducing in such years.



5 Over the 7-year period, there was a significant concordance among species in their viable seed crop and crop efficiency, but not in their potential seed crop. Crop efficiency was positively correlated to potential seed crop for Abies and Betula, but not for Acer.



6 High seed production was related to warm, dry conditions in the spring of the previous year (i.e. at reproductive bud initiation) but to a moist summer in the year of seed maturation.



7 Masting in these three species thus appears to be controlled by several factors, including climate and pollination efficiency.

TI  - Acorn production by oaks in central coastal California: influence of weather at three levels
PY  - 1996
AB  - Mean annual acorn crop size of oaks in central coastal California correlated with weather for four of five species. For the deciduous Quercuslobata and Quercusdouglasii, larger crops were produced in years when April temperatures were warmest, while for the evergreen Quercusagrifalia and Quercuschrysolepis, crops were larger when there was more rain one and two years prior to the year when acorns were produced. No correlations were found between weather and mean annual acorn production by Quercuskelloggii. Within years, individual Q. douglasii that flowered during periods of greater solar radiation produced more acorns, and during 1 of 5 years individual Q. lobata and Q. agrifolia produced larger crops when they flowered during warm, dry periods. These results indicate that conditions favorable for pollination and fertilization strongly enhance mean annual acorn production in Q. lobata and Q. douglasii and may have an effect on differences in acorn crop size among individual Q. lobata, Q. douglasii, and Q...

TI  - WITHIN‐ AND AMONG‐TREE VARIATION IN FLOWER AND FRUIT PRODUCTION IN TWO SPECIES OF CARYA (JUGLANDACEAE)
PY  - 1989
AB  - The pattems of variability in the production of staminate inflorescences, pistillate flowers, and fruits for Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch and C. tomentosa (Poir.) Nutt. at Hutcheson Memorial Forest (Somerset County, New Jersey) were examined over a four-year period. We sought to determine 1) the pattems of variability in flowering and fruiting (within-trees, among-trees, and between-years), 2) if variable flowering might account for observed nut-bearing pattems, and 3) what were the relative contributions of intrinsic (genetic) and/or extrinsic (environmental) factors in determining flower production and fruit set. In general, our fine-scale analysis of shoots within canopies did not reveal a distinct mast fruiting pattem. While the number of male and female flowers varied significantly (among trees and between years), fruit set was not markedly affected. Variability of flowering and fruiting among shoots within trees was low. Both flowering and fruiting were observed to have a strong genetic and/or microenvironmental basis; however, flowering appeared more plastic and thus more sensitive to yearly environmental vagaries than did fruiting. Favorable environmental conditions at the time of flower differentiation may result in increased flower production; but, this does not necessarily result in increased fruit set. Many pistillate flowers abscise around the time of pollination and fertilization, apparently adjusting fruit set to available shoot resources. Approximately 50% of the pistillate flowers of both species fail to set fruit. Overall, individual trees exhibit their own flowering and fruiting schedules, suggesting the need to account for this level of variability in future studies of mast fruiting.

AB  - This study examined how fire events affected the flowering of two native palms in a fire-prone environment. By examining how flowering varied across vegetative associations, I determined whether plant size or mass influenced flowering, whether canopy openness or increased soil fertility following fire enhanced flowering, and whether potential flowering stimuli interacted. Individuals of the widespread Serenoa repens and narrow endemic Sabal etonia were monitored (for a total of 9900 plant–year records) for growth performance and reproduction in flatwoods, scrubby flatwoods, scrub, and sandhill that were affected by single or multiple fires. In addition, clipping, fertilizing, and clipping+fertilizing experiments were conducted in three vegetative associations to simulate the effects of fire in order to ascertain which stimuli and their interactions encouraged flowering episodes. Both species exhibited marked resiliency to fire, rapidly resprouting from extensive underground stores. The frequencies of leaf...

TI  - Habitat distribution and competitive neighborhoods of two Florida palmettos
PY  - 1995
AB  - ABRAHAMSON, W. G. (Department of Biology, Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA 17837). Habitat distribution and competitive neighborhoods of two Florida palmettos. Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 122: 1-14.-Two ecologically similar palmettos, Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia, co-occur on the Florida peninsula's central and Atlantic coast ridges. Inasmuch as they share many characteristics of growth form, reproductive strategies, responses to fire, and habitat occurrence, these palmettos may be able to coexist because they occur in different microhabitats or plant neighborhoods. Serenoa reached its highest dominance in poorly drained flatwoods and its lowest dominance in well-drained sandhills. Sabal, on the other hand, was uncommon in flatwoods but exhibited its highest dominance in well-drained sand pine scrub and sandhills. Nearest-neighbor and principal components analyses showed that Sabal neighborhoods potentially had more competitive interference and in flatwoods included more oak (Quercus geminata) and fetterbush (Lyonia lucida) than Serenoa neighborhoods. These differences in species microsite-distribution patterns suggest spatial displacement of palmettos based at least partially on competitive interference and adaptations to edaphic conditions. Local populations had different growth forms such that palmettos growing in flatwoods communities lived in more closely spaced but lower canopied neighborhoods and bore more leaves than palmettos growing in scrubby flatwoods. Palmetto leaf numbers of both species were higher in recently burned sites but Serenoa maintained more leaves than Sabal under all post-bum conditions. Measures of plant vigor and performance (e.g., crown size, biomass) did not exhibit the trends expected based on palmetto abundance patterns; rather, local effects (e.g., overstory canopy coverage) may more strongly affect performance. Seedling and adult palmettos had very low mortality rates and slow growth rates suggesting that extremely long-lived individuals (500 yr old palmettos may not be uncommon) compose populations that have remarkably low turnover of genotypes-a likely consequence of adaptation to long-lived, stable environments. These palmettos are vulnerable to human-caused disturbance because of their limited ability to quickly recolonize former habitats.

TI  - SYNCHRONIZED ANNUAL SEED PRODUCTION BY 16 PRINCIPAL TREE SPECIES IN A TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FOREST, JAPAN
PY  - 2002
AB  - To investigate synchronized annual fluctuation of seed production and its advantage for regeneration at the community level, for nine years (1987–1995) we monitored the flowering, seed production, and seedling emergence of the 16 principal tree species in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa Forest Reserve, in central Japan.

We found that the species with higher synchronized flowering within a population had larger fluctuation of annual seed production at the population level. The coefficient of concordance of flowering and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production were continuously distributed among species, making it difficult to distinguish masting from nonmasting species. The annual seed production patterns of the 16 species were classified, by cluster analysis, into groups that synchronize their fluctuation of annual seed production. This analysis showed a highly synchronized annual seed production, not only among congeneric species, but also among species of different families.

Although our results have some insufficiency of statistical significance, they did show that predator satiation, both in a population and a guild, effectively operated for many species to enhance seed survival at the pre-dispersal stage. They also showed that pollination efficiency was likely to be operating at the population level for half of the wind-pollinating species. However, generalist predator satiation at the postdispersal seed stage may not operate in a simple, detectable manner in this species-rich forest community.

It is highly probable that there are combined effects of several factors: limited weather triggers for flowering, common flowering physiology among taxonomically related species, and the ecological advantages at the population and guild levels, may cause multiple species to have synchronized fluctuation patterns of seed production.

TI  - Patterns of Resource Allocation in Wildflower Populations of Fields and Woods
PY  - 1979
AB  - Fifty-two populations of fifty species of wildflowers characteristic of either field or deciduous forest were analyzed to determine pattens of biomass allocation to component organs. These populations' allocation patterns were used to determine generalized allocation patterns of the herb component of earlier (field) and later (deciduous forest) secondary successional communities. The following patterns were determined: (1) The proportion of dry matter allocated to seed reproductive organs was greater in field populations than in woods populations; (2) The herbs of woodland habitats allocated a greater proportion of their resources to leaves and belowground organs than field habitat herbs; (3) The field annuals allocated a greater proportion of their resources to reproduction than field perennials; (4) Introduced species showed a higher reproductive allocation than native species of fields; (5) Regression analysis showed strong correlations of component organ biomass to total biomass and belowground biomass to shoot biomass.

TI  - Masting uncoupling: mast seeding does not follow all mast flowering episodes in a dioecious juniper tree
PY  - 2012
AB  - Evolutionary selective forces, like predator satiation and pollination efficiency, are acknowledged to be major causes of masting (the variable, periodic and synchronic production of seeds in a population). However, a number of recent studies indicate that resources might also play an important role on shaping masting patterns. Dioecious masting species offer a privileged framework to study the role of resources on masting variation, since male and female plants often experience different reproductive costs and selective pressures. We followed masting and reproductive investment (RI) of the dioecious tree Juniperus thurifera in two populations along 10 years and studied the different response of males and females to experimentally increased water and nutrient availability in a third population. Juniperus thurifera females invested in reproduction three times more resources than males. Such disparity generated different resource-use strategies in male and female trees. Tree-ring growth and water use efficiency (WUE) confirmed that sexes differed in their resource investment temporal pattern, with males using current resources for reproduction and females using resources accumulated during longer periods. Watered and fertilized female trees presented significantly higher flowering reproductive investments than males and experienced an extraordinary mast-flowering event. However, seeding RI and mast seeding were not affected by the treatment. This suggests that although resource availability affects the reproductive output of this species, there are other major forces regulating masting on J. thurifera. During 10 years, J. thurifera male and female trees presented high and low flowering years more or less synchronously. However, not all mast flowering episodes resulted in mast seeding, leading to masting uncoupling between flowering and seeding. Since flowering costs represent only 1% of females’ total reproductive investments, masting uncoupling could be a beneficial bet-hedging strategy to maximize reproductive output in spite of unpredictable catastrophic events.

TI  - Effects of fruit crop size on intensity of fruit removal in Viburnum prunifolium (Caprifoliaceae)
PY  - 1994
AB  - We tested the effect of crop size on fruit removal from an early successional shrub, Viburnum prunifolium (Caprifoliaceae), by comparing the «survival» distributions of fruit from plants with large crops to those with small crops. We found that crop size does not affect rate of fruit removal. Our findings differ from previous researchers who demonstrated correlations between large crop size and higher removal rates from Sambucus pubens and from Viburnum dentatum shrubs. Differences between our findings and those of other researchers may be due either to differences in statistical analyses or type of avian dispersers (solitary versus flocking species). These data do not support the fruit crop size hypothesis

TI  - Masting in whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) depletes stored nutrients
PY  - 2012
AB  - • In masting trees, synchronized, heavy reproductive events are thought to deplete stored resources and to impose a replenishment period before subsequent masting. However, direct evidence of resource depletion in wild, masting trees is very rare. Here, we examined the timing and magnitude (local vs individual-level) of stored nutrient depletion after a heavy mast event in Pinus albicaulis. • In 2005, the mast year, we compared seasonal changes in leaf and sapwood nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and leaf photosynthetic rates in cone-bearing branches, branches that never produced cones, and branches with experimentally removed cones. We also compared nutrient concentrations in cone branches and branches that had never had cones between 2005 and 2006, and measured tree ring width and new shoot growth during 2005. • During the mast year, N or P depletion occurred only in tissue fractions of reproductive branches, where photosynthetic rates were reduced. However, by the end of the following year, nutrients were depleted in all branches, indicating individual-level resource depletion. New shoot and radial growth were not affected by masting. • We provide direct evidence that mast events in wild trees deplete stored nutrients. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating reproductive costs over time and at the individual level.

Summary
This review reports on the processes associated with costs of reproduction, including some theoretical considerations, definitions and methodological aspects, followed by a list of the situations where costs are difficult to find. Despite some exceptions, case studies, examined by trade-offs between reproduction and other life-history traits, generally support the predictions of the cost of reproduction hypothesis. The cost of reproduction as an evolutionary determinant of sexual dimorphism in life history traits in dioecious species was specifically tested, considering that the higher cost of reproduction in females has driven the life history traits related to sexual dimorphism. Females of woody dioecious species were consistently smaller than males supporting the costs of reproduction hypothesis. By contrast, females of herbaceous perennials were generally the larger sex, which did not fit the expectations of the hypothesis. Finally, the mechanisms that enable the compensation of the reproductive costs are detailed, including the plastic responses of photosynthesis and growth, the effects of the timing of investment, plant architecture and plant physiological integration.

TI  - Effect of Cone Size on Adult and Larval Foraging Behavior of Strobilomyia neanthracina and Strobilomyia appalachensis (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)
PY  - 1998
AB  - A 2-yr field study was carried out to determine if adult female cone maggots, Strobilomyia neanthracina Michelsen and Strobilomyia appalachensis Michelsen, oviposit preferentially on longer rather than shorter cones of white spruce [ Picea glauca (Moench) Voss], and black spruce [ P. mariana (Miller) Britton, Sterns & Poggenberg], respectively. The study also examined if resources increased with cone size and were limiting in small cones, and whether maggots feed mainly in sections of the cone where seeds are heaviest. Females of both species laid more eggs on longer cones than shorter cones. Number of seeds per cone and number of seeds eaten per cone were positively related to cone length. However, the proportion of seeds eaten per cone was negatively related to the number of seeds per cone in only 1 of 2 yr for white spruce and in neither year for black spruce, providing only very weak support for the prediction that resources were limiting in small cones. We evaluated the influence of cone length and seed position within cones on seed weight for white spruce only. Seed weight was positively related to cone length and was heaviest in the central sections of the cone. Larvae consumed the fewest seeds in the basal sections of the cone but nearly equal proportions in the central and apical sections. Our results demonstrate that the foraging behavior of adult females and larval cone maggots results in larvae consuming more and bigger seeds during development.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny and evolution of host-plant use in conifer seed chalcids in the genus Megastigmus (Hymenoptera: Torymidae)
PY  - 2005
AB  - .  Phylogenetic relationships amongst Megastigmus species (Chalcidoidea: Torymidae) associated with conifer seeds were inferred from DNA sequence data. Twenty-nine species of seed chalcids were analysed using two different genes, cytochrome b (mitochondrial DNA) and the D2 domain of the 28S ribosomal DNA. Maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses showed that taxa formed two monophyletic groups, one clade comprising all species associated with Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae hosts with the exception of Chamaecyparis, and the other clade composed of species associated with Pinaceae. Species infesting Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae seemed to be specialized to particular host genera or even to be species specific, which was consistent with a taxonomic radiation following initial host adaptation. By contrast, Megastigmus species associated with Pinaceae appeared capable of shifting onto different congeneric species or even onto a new host genus, with their evolution apparently less constrained by plant association. We hypothesized that the Megastigmus group associated with Pinaceae may have a much higher invasive potential than that related to Cupressaceae. The study also confirmed the presence of invasive Nearctic species in the Palaearctic, and demonstrated the existence of a cryptic species complex.

TI  - REGULATION OF FRUIT AND SEED PRODUCTION IN AN ANNUAL LEGUME, CASSIA FASCICULATA'
PY  - 1982
AB  - This study examines the factors that limit female reproductive function (fruit and seed production) in the annual plant, Cassia fasciculata Michx. (Leguminosae), an hermaphroditic herb that inhabits prairies, open woods, and waste places in the eastern USA. Removal of competitors and addition of water to plants in the field showed that resource levels prior to fruit filling influence plant size which, in turn, is positively related to the number of fruit matured. Manual addition of pollen to flowers in the field did not increase the number of fruit matured, suggesting that fruit production was not pollinator limited. Removal of rapidly growing fruit resulted in growth and mat- uration of fruit that normally would not have matured, indicating that resources limited fruit produc- tion. In four populations studied, 24-70% of initiated fruit matured, 12-40% aborted or died, 3-31% were still developing at the time of plant death, and 6-12% were lost to predators. In fruit that matured, between 23% and 73% of initiated seeds reached maturity, 22-43% were aborted, and 0- 49% were lost to seed predators. These data indicate that seed production was limited by resources and seed predators. It is hypothesized that overinitiation of fruit in C. fasciculata is an adaptive response to either: (I) the loss of juvenile fruits to seed predators, (2) variation in fruit quality coupled with the ability of the plant to selectively mature high-quality fruit, or (3) unpredictability of resource levels and survival during fruit filling. The generally low levels of predation on juvenile fruits make the first hypothesis unlikely for C. fasciculata. Plants did, however, selectively mature fruit with large num- bers of developing seeds. Furthermore, variation in the number of fruit matured per inflorescence seemed to be related to variation in precipitation and plant survival through the fruit-filling period. Thus, the data support both the second and third hypotheses.

TI  - COSTS OF REPRODUCTION IN ILEX AQUIFOLIUM : EFFECTS AT TREE, BRANCH AND LEAF LEVELS
PY  - 1997
AB  - 1 Intersexual differences in vegetative growth as a result of greater investments in reproduction by females were examined at three modular levels (leaf, branch and tree) in the dioecious tree Ilex aquifolium in two northern Spanish localities during three consecutive years, 1993-95. 2 Neither localities nor sexes differed in mean leaf weight per branch; however, within female trees, nonfruiting branches exhibited higher leaf weight than fruiting ones in 1993. 3 Females allocated about eight times more biomass per branch to reproduction at fruiting than males at flowering. Fruit production limited RGR of the branches only in one locality during one year. However, in the same tree, fruit-bearing branches grew less than nonfruiting branches. 4 The RGR of nonfruiting female branches only differed from that of male branches in one locality. These results suggest that females at that locality incurred higher costs than females at the other site. 5 At tree level, growth was examined by measuring tree-ring widths during the last 30 years. Males grew more than females at both study sites. A lower growth for females was demonstrated at tree level but not at branch or leaf level in one locality. No relationship was found between branch elongation and tree-ring width during the last five years, which suggests that branch growth and trunk growth might be decoupled. 6 This study suggests the importance of considering several levels of the modular hierarchy for the analyses of costs of reproduction.

TI  - Variability in seed cone production and functional response of seed predators to seed cone availability: support for the predator satiation hypothesis
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary 1. Mast seeding is a reproductive strategy in some perennial plants defined as synchronous production of large seed crops at irregular intervals. One widely accepted theory to explain this behaviour is the predator satiation hypothesis, which states that the synchronous and variable production of seeds within a population will maximize the probability of seed survival through satiation of seed predators. 2. Although some short-term studies have documented the influence of variable and synchronized production of seeds on herbivore attack rate during one or few mast years, long-term data including multiple mast seeding years and patterns of cone production and herbivore attack on individual trees are needed to assess (i) how cone production, variability and synchrony affect individual plant fitness and (ii) the functional responses of seed predators to mast seeding events. 3. We tested these objectives, collecting long-term (29 years) data on female seed cone production and rates of seed predator attack from 217 individual contiguous trees within a Pinus ponderosa population. 4. Our results support the predator satiation hypothesis. First, we found high interannual synchrony and variability in seed cone production and a type II functional response of seed predators to available cones. Secondly, years with high cone production (mast years) had markedly lower rates of seed predator attack than years of low production (i.e. a population-level satiation effect). Thirdly, within mast years, individuals with high cone production had markedly lower rates of attack than individuals with low cone production (i.e. an individual-level satiation effect). Finally, individual trees with greater synchrony and more variable cone production suffered lower rates of attack. 5. Synthesis: Our long-term data on individual trees lend strong support to the hypothesis that mast seeding in Pinus ponderosa has evolved in response to natural selection from insect seed predators.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation in fruit production and seed predation in a perennial herb influenced by habitat quality and population size
PY  - 2008
AB  - 1. In patchily distributed plant species, seed production is likely to be influenced both by local abiotic factors affecting plant size and conditions for fruit maturation, and by population characteristics affecting the intensity of interactions with mutualists and antagonists. However, the relative importance of these effects is poorly known. 2. We used multiple regression and path models to examine the importance of abiotic factors (sun exposure, soil depth) and population characteristics (size, density and connectivity) for variation in flower and fruit production and intensity of seed predation among 39 populations of the long-lived herb Vincetoxicum hirundinaria in three consecutive years. In addition, we manipulated water availability in a field experiment and recorded short-term and long-term effects on fruit output, and conducted a supplemental hand-pollination experiment. 3. Flower production varied little, while fruit initiation, fruit abortion and fruit predation varied considerably among years. Sun exposure and soil depth affected fruit production per plant indirectly and positively through their effects on flower number. Population density affected fruit production negatively through its effect on flower number. Both fruit initiation and the proportion of fruits attacked by the tephritid fly Euphranta connexa were related positively to population size. 4. The number of full-size fruits per plant was related positively to sun exposure and population size in two years each, and related negatively to population density in one year. However, because of seed predation, the number of intact mature fruits was related significantly to population characteristics in only one of three years. 5. The field experiments showed that both shortage of water and insufficient pollination may limit fruit set in V. hirundinaria. 6. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that the relative importance of local abiotic conditions and population characteristics may vary considerably along the chain of events from flower formation to intact fruit, and also among years. They further show that, at least in species with a naturally patchy distribution, connectivity may be relatively unimportant for variation in reproductive output compared to effects of habitat quality, population size and density.

TI  - Juniperus communis: victim of the combined action of climate warming and nitrogen deposition?
PY  - 2009
AB  - Research on the combined effects of climate change and nitrogen deposition on reproductive traits, and especially on the production of viable seeds, is still scarce despite their importance for population persistence and expansion. Hence, in this study we set out to investigate the direct and indirect effects of the above-mentioned global change drivers on seed viability in the coniferous shrub Juniperus communis L. In many parts of its European range, juniper is increasingly threatened, partly because of a lack of sexual reproduction. We hypothesised that this regeneration failure is partly due to poor seed viability. Using data from 39 populations throughout Europe, we were able to demonstrate that a strong, triangular-shaped relationship exists between the percentage of viable seeds produced and the percentage of juniper seedlings occurring in a population, which indicates that the species is indeed partly seed limited. Furthermore, based on an extended dataset of 42 populations, we found that seed viability was negatively affected by temperature, measured as mean annual growing degree-days, and nitrogen deposition (but not by drought). Suggestions are made about the processes behind the observed patterns, but more research is required. Nevertheless, our results do raise serious concerns for the conservation of juniper in light of the predicted rise in temperature and global nitrogen emissions. Furthermore, it is likely that similar patterns can also be observed for other species.

TI  - Conservation Opportunities in Spanish Juniper Juniperus thurifera Woodlands: The Case of Migratory Thrushes Turdus spp.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary. Conservation opportunities in Spanish juniper Juniperus thurifera woodlands: the case of migratory thrushes Turdus spp. Spanish juniper Juniperus thurifera woodlands are the core habitat of several sites included in the Nature 2000 Network and the wintering ground of many European thrushes Turdus spp. These birds have a major ecological role as seed dispersers and are increasingly taken into account in the design of strategies aimed to conserve or restore plant communities. Socio-economic changes in rural Spain have reduced traditional sheep grazing in juniper woodlands, which are now increasingly used for wood production. This has brought the opportunity to improve their carrying capacity for migratory thrushes. Here we explore the spatio-temporal patterning of fleshy cone production and the way birds track this resource. We also investigate whether fleshy cone availability constrains bird numbers. The results show sharp losses of cones during the ripening period, inter-site and inter-winter cha...

TI  - Critical phases in the seed development of common juniper (Juniperus communis)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Common juniper (Juniperus communis L.) populations in northwest European lowlands are currently declining in size and number. An important cause of this decline is a lack of natural regeneration. Low seed viability seems to be one of the main bottlenecks in this process. Previous research revealed a negative relation between seed viability and both temperature and nitrogen deposition. Additionally, the seeds of common juniper have a variable ripening time, which possibly influences seed viability. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. In order to elucidate this puzzle, it is important to understand in which phases of seed production the main defects are situated, together with the influence of ripening time. In this study, we compared seed viability of populations with and without successful recruitment. We examined three seed phases: (i) gamete development; (ii) fertilisation and early-embryo development; and (iii) late-embryo development. After the first two phases, we found no difference in the percentage viable seeds between populations with or without recruitment. After late-embryo development, populations without recruitment showed a significantly lower percentage of viable seeds. These results suggest that late-embryo development is a bottleneck in seed development. However, the complex interaction between seed viability and ripening time suggest that the causes should be in the second seed phase, as the accelerated development of male and female gametophytes may disturb the male-female synchrony for successful mating.

TI  - Contrasting phenology and female cone characteristics of the two Macaronesian island endemic cedars (Juniperus cedrus and J. brevifolia)
PY  - 2009
AB  - Phenology and female cone characteristics of the two endemic cedars (Juniperus cedrus and J. brevifolia) from the Macaronesian islands were studied. Despite their closely taxonomic affinity and their evolution under insular conditions, different trends were recorded. Mature J. cedrus female cones were present throughout the year, while those from J. brevifolia were only present in summer and autumn. J. cedrus female cone size was significantly larger than that of J. brevifolia, a trend consistent with the presence of larger vertebrates (lizards and birds) in the Canary Islands. However, water content was four times higher in J. brevifolia female cones, which can be related with the higher rainfall existing in the Azores. J. cedrus has two or three seeds per cone, whereas J. brevifolia frequently had three. Seeds from J. cedrus were clearly larger and heavier, coinciding with the female cone size trend. However, tetrazolium tests revealed higher viability values in J. brevifolia. The relatively low percentage of filled seeds in J. cedrus could be a consequence of the climatic stress and limits to pollination due to fragmented populations as described for other Juniperus species. In summary, our results reveal that some environmental factors such as the harsh conditions, high population fragmentation and the dependence on large dispersers have compromised the fitness of J. cedrus in the Canary Islands.

TI  - Vertebrate-dispersed plants: why they don’t behave the way they should
PY  - 1986
AB  - Recent field studies of the interaction between vertebrate-dispersed plants and their seed vectors have often revealed patterns departing significantly from those predicted by earlier coevolutionary approaches. It is argued here that two families of assumptions implicit in these approaches account, in the case of plants at least, for their frequent predictive failure. These assumptions are that (1) the interaction between a plant and its vertebrate dispersal agents takes place in a world where they virtually are the only inhabitants; and (2) plant attributes relevant to the dispersal process effectively undergo measurable evolutionary change within a reasonable time frame in response to changing ecological conditions. It is shown that these two sets of assumptions are not generally supported by available evidence.

TI  - Avian Fruit Removal: Effects of Fruit Variation, Crop Size, and Insect Damage
PY  - 1987
AB  - Avian dispersal of seeds of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris) was studied in Mediterranean shrubland, southern Spain. Fourteen species of small fru- givorous birds in the genera Sylvia, Turdus, Sturnus, and Erithacus accounted for 97.4% of the fruits consumed by birds. The significance of each bird species as an Olea fruit consumer was closely related to its abundance in the area and was not associated with its dependence on the fruit for food; this resulted in a highly asymmetric interaction between the plant and its dispersers. Fruit production differed greatly between two consecutive seasons. During an extremely dry year most trees aborted their entire fruit crop just after flowering. During the 2nd yr, both flower production and fruit set increased, and this resulted in larger crops of ripe fruit. Most fruits that ripened (96.2% of the final-sized fruits) during the year of low fruit pro- duction were consumed by dispersers (X = 93.9%), and incidence of fruit-damaging agents was low (6.0%). During the 2nd yr, fruit loss to the two main fruit predators, Dacus oleae (Tephritidae) and Prays oleae (Yponomeutidae), increased (X = 27.1%, range 1.1-52.3%). A satiation process took place during this year since fruit production exceeded the energy demand of the disperser assemblage, and this increased the potential for fruit loss to insect frugivores. Fruit removal by dispersers decreased (X = 5 2.4%), but the increase in fecundity during the 2nd yr for most of the trees compensated for this difference and resulted in a greater absolute number of seeds removed. Most variation in ripe fruit removal by birds was attributed to the interaction of dispersal- related plant traits with insect frugivores that determine post-ripening fruit losses. The types of higher order interactions that result from the action of birds, the pulp-damaging fly, and the seed-eating moth larva may damp, or reverse, any selective effect of a single system component on plant traits related to seed dispersal.

TI  - Seed predation and cross-pollination in mast-seeding beech (Fagus sylvatica) patches
PY  - 1987
AB  - In this study we examined cross-pollination and levels of insect and verte- brate predation on the seeds of beech as a function of stand size and tree size. Cross- pollination in this wind-pollinated species is positively correlated with stand size and flower density. In two mast years, 6-14% of seeds contained no kernels, and in a nonmast year the figure was 24%. Predispersal destruction of seeds by a moth (Cydia fagiglandana) was 3.1% in a mast year and 38% in a nonmast year. The variation in seed destruction by vertebrates was much less between mast (5.7%) and nonmast (1 2%) years. Destruction by the moth was negatively correlated with tree size, while that by vertebrates was positively correlated with tree size. Vertebrate seed predation was negatively correlated with stand size. In a large stand, < 10% of the seeds were consumed by vertebrates by April in two mast years. Both cross-pollination and seed predation may have been important factors in the evolution of mast seeding in beech.

TI  - How do plants know when other plants are flowering? Resource depletion, pollen limitation and mast‐seeding in a perennial wildflower
PY  - 2009
AB  - Mast-seeding is the synchronous and periodic reproduction by plant populations. This phenomenon has been widely studied from a community-level perspective, but we know extremely little about how plants are able to synchronize reproduction. Here, we present the first experimental test of proximate mechanisms of mast-seeding, by preventing reproduction in an iteroparous, mast-seeding wildflower. Through a series of experiments, we show that mobile carbohydrate stores (NSC) control alternate-year flowering by individual plants; seed set depletes NSC which prevents flowering the following year. Plants are synchronized by density-dependent pollen limitation; when plants flower asynchronously, they set fewer seeds, which prevents NSC depletion. Therefore, these individual plants flower in subsequent years and become synchronized. Because mast-seeding is a consequence of physiological controls of reproduction, differences in plant resource acquisition and allocation could dramatically change patterns of seed production, and changes in plant consumers and pollinators could change selection on physiological and developmental pathways.

TI  - Annual variability in reproduction of Juniperus communis L. in a Mediterranean mountain: Relationship to seed predation and weather
PY  - 2002
AB  - AbstractThe interannual patterns of reproductive output were analysed for a population of Juniperus communis in the Mediterranean mountains of southern Spain. Cone production, number of seeds per cone, predispersal seed predation, seed abortion, and final seed set were studied for six consecutive years (1992-1997). Interannual variation in reproduction was assessed in relation to weather conditions during pollination and cone development. All the reproductive components varied strongly among years. Ripe cone production correlated positively to seed set and seed predation but was independent of the percentages of empty and filled seeds. The percentage of empty seeds positively correlated to precipitation during the month of pollination. Interannual patterns in reproductive output proved inconsistent with the predator satiation hypothesis. Mediterranean mountain weather affected juniper reproduction at a local scale, acting in a narrow range of variation, since seed emptiness is governed primarily by factor...

TI  - Fruit production in three masting tree species does not rely on stored carbon reserves
PY  - 2013
AB  - Fruiting is typically considered to massively burden the seasonal carbon budget of trees. The cost of reproduction has therefore been suggested as a proximate factor explaining observed mast-fruiting patterns. Here, we used a large-scale, continuous 13C labeling of mature, deciduous trees in a temperate Swiss forest to investigate to what extent fruit formation in three species with masting reproduction behavior (Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea) relies on the import of stored carbon reserves. Using a free-air CO2 enrichment system, we exposed trees to 13C-depleted CO2 during 8 consecutive years. By the end of this experiment, carbon reserve pools had significantly lower δ13C values compared to control trees. δ13C analysis of new biomass during the first season after termination of the CO2 enrichment allowed us to distinguish the sources of built-in carbon (old carbon reserves vs. current assimilates). Flowers and expanding leaves carried a significant 13C label from old carbon stores. In contrast, fruits and vegetative infructescence tissues were exclusively produced from current, unlabeled photoassimilates in all three species, including F. sylvatica, which had a strong masting season. Analyses of δ13C in purified starch from xylem of fruit-bearing shoots revealed a complete turn-over of starch during the season, likely due to its usage for bud break. This study is the first to directly demonstrate that fruiting is independent from old carbon reserves in masting trees, with significant implications for mechanistic models that explain mast seeding.

TI  - Frugivore‐Mediated Selection on Fruit and Seed Size: Birds and St. Lucie's Cherry, Prunus Mahaleb
PY  - 1995
AB  - Frugivorous birds consumed >75% of the ripe fruits of a Prunus mahaleb population in southeastern Spain, but only half of the seed crop was successfully removed from parent plants by legitimate seed dispersers. For two consecutive years, I studied the sign and magnitude of phenotypic selection exerted by frugivorous birds on fruit size and seed mass, two key traits in this mutualistic plant-seed disperser interaction. Individual plants showed extensive phenotypic variation in these traits, but among-individual variation accounted for <30% of total trait variance. Selection patterns were assessed at two levels by separating the effects of selection acting on the parent tree (among-crop selection; comparing fruit removal and seed dispersal efficiency among individual plants) and selection acting at the individual seed level (comparing seed mass variation before and after dispersal by frugivorous birds). Dispersal efficiency (percentage of the seed crop dispersed) correlated negatively with crop size, fruit size, and seed mass. However, only crop size was signifi- cantly, positively, correlated with the absolute number of seeds dispersed relative to the population mean, used as the estimator for relative fitness. Greater visitation by dispersers to smaller plants compensated for their lower fecundity but, for plants with larger crops, a greater number of seeds was dispersed despite lower dispersal efficiency. Directional and stabilizing/disruptive selection gradients on fruit traits were not significant or, at best, only marginally significant, indicative of weak and inconsistent selection effects on maternal phenotypes. In contrast, selection on individual seed phenotypes was significant. Seeds on the ground, after successful dispersal by frugivorous birds, were significantly smaller than seeds 'available' at the start of the fruiting season. Observed selection differentials on individual seed mass were -0.12 (1992) and -0.13 (1993), suggesting that frugivores might exert strong selection on individual seed phenotypes irrespective of the maternal phenotype. This selection regime, with far-reaching demographic consequences but low potential for inducing evolutionary change in fruit traits, is expected on the basis of known hierarchical selection cues used by foraging frugivores. Fruit phenotypic variation might be irrelevant as a cue used by birds for discrimination among fruit crops, but, given extensive within-crop variation, frugivores might strongly select among seed phenotypes in a process not related consistently to among-crop selection on maternal phenotypes.

TI  - Demand-driven resource investment in annual seed production by a perennial angiosperm precludes resource limitation.
PY  - 2013
AB  - The limits on annual seed production have long been characterized as restriction by either pollination success or resource provision to seed development. This expected dichotomy between pollen and resource limitation is based on the assumption that reproductive resources are fixed, which is reasonable for semelparous species. In contrast, iteroparity can ease the constraints on reproductive output per breeding season, if resources can be either mobilized from past storage or borrowed against future performance. For perennial plants, these options allow enhanced reproductive investment in response to unusually good pollination, so that annual seed production may not be pollen or resource limited. We assessed demand-governed reproductive investment by manipulating both resource supply capacity (partial defoliation) and resource demand (pollination quality: fully self-pollination, fully cross-pollination, or combinations of partial self- and cross-pollination within the inflorescence) for a forest herb, Stenanthium occidentale, which is subject to strong pre-dispersal inbreeding depression. Insensitivity to partial defoliation indicated that reproductive output was not source regulated. Instead, demand by developing seeds governs resource distribution, as demonstrated by elevated photosynthate translocation to fruits on fully cross-pollinated plants and the ability of completely defoliated plants to produce seeds. Such contingent resource allocation eliminates a simple dichotomy between pollen receipt and resource availability as limits on annual seed production. Instead, such flexible reproductive investment allows iteroparous perennials to participate maximally in current reproduction (as determined by ovule production) following superior pollination, or to conserve resources for future reproduction following poor pollination.

TI  - A Multiscalar Drought Index Sensitive to Global Warming: The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract The authors propose a new climatic drought index: the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The SPEI is based on precipitation and temperature data, and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment. The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance, the accumulation of deficit/surplus at different time scales, and adjustment to a log-logistic probability distribution. Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the SPEI is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-PDSI and SPEI identified an...

Success in emerging from the seed was not influenced by seed size. The static intraspecific allometry of wasps was determined.

TI  - Relictual distribution reaches the top: Elevation constrains fertility and leaf longevity in Juniperus thurifera
PY  - 2010
AB  - Juniperus thurifera populations are scattered throughout the western Mediterranean basin and are relictual from its Tertiary distribution due to progressive climatic warming since the last glacial period. To disentangle the factors responsible for its extremely low fertility we combined a microscale experimental design with a macroscale study. At the microscale we experimentally alleviated environmental stress by watering and fertilizing during two years a set of trees in one population. At macroscale we selected 11 populations across a geographical range and sampled them for three years. Macroscale patterns evidenced that both plant fertility and leaf longevity diminished with increasing elevation. Both microscale and macroscale illustrated the importance of water and nutrient availability on leaf growth and plant fertility: On the microscale experiments, regular supply of water and nutrients increased fruit-set by 300%. Macroscale showed that increases in resource availability (precipitation) resulted in reductions of seed abortion, although paralleled by increases in seed predation. Altogether, our results indicate that fertility is constrained both by elevation and by resource limitation. Therefore any potential lift in the elevational distribution limits will result in synergistic fertility reductions due to harder physical conditions and lower water and nutrient availability. Both will compromise future regeneration of this relictual species, although population decline might be buffered temporary thanks to longevity of adult trees.

TI  - A methodological approach of climatological modelling of air temperature and precipitation through GIS techniques
PY  - 2000
AB  - This study proposes an empirical methodology for modelling and mapping the air temperature (mean maximum, mean and mean minimum) and total precipitation, all of which are monthly and annual, using geographical information systems (GIS) techniques. The method can be seen as an alternative to classical interpolation techniques when spatial information is available. The geographical area used to develop and apply this model is Catalonia (32000 km 2 , northeast Spain). We have developed a multiple regression analysis between these meteorological variables as the dependent ones, and some geographical variables (altitude (ALT), latitude (LAT), continentality (CON), solar radiation (RAD) and a cloudiness factor (CLO)) as the independent ones. Data for the dependent variables were obtained from meteorological stations, and data for the independent variables were elaborated from a 180 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Multiple regression coefficients (bn) were used to build final maps, using digital layers for each independent variable, and applying basic GIS techniques. The results are very satisfactory in the case of mean air temperature and mean minimum air temperature, with coefficients of determination (R 2 ) between 0.79 and 0.97, depending on the month; in the case of mean maximum air temperature, R 2 ranges between 0.70 and 0.89, while in the case of precipitation, it ranges between 0.60 and 0.91.

TI  - DISSECTING FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN PLANT FECUNDITY
PY  - 1991
AB  - This paper analyses, on an individual plant basis, the various components determining seed production in the evergreen shrub Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae), in order to estimate their relative contributions to individual differences in fecundity. The rela- tionships between fecundity and age, size, and growth rate are also examined. Experimental pollination and watering were done in an attempt to alter natural patterns of partial fe- cundity components. Fecundity of individual plants is partitioned into its absolute (number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence) and relative (fruits/flower and seeds/ fruit) partial components, and the following questions are addressed: (1) Are there indi- vidual differences in relative components of fecundity? (2) What are the proportional contributions of relative and absolute components of fecundity to individual variation in seed production? (3) Are relative measures of reproductive success reliable predictors of individual differences in fecundity? (4) When induced experimentally, do changes in partial fecundity components translate into modifications of the population's ranking of absolute fecundities? Fecundity depended more on plant size than age, was unrelated to growth rate, and was limited by water, but not pollen, availability. Individual plants differed in all components of fecundity examined, and differences were consistent among years. The proportional contributions of the various components to individual differences in fecundity were very unequal. Almost all variation among plants in seed production (-90% of variance) was explained by the variances and covariances of number of inflorescences and number of flowers per inflorescence. Variation among plants in the two relative components (fruit and seed set), even though statistically significant, had a negligible influence on individual differences in fecundity. These patterns remained invariant despite significant modification of flower production and fruit set induced by artificially watering a part of the study population. Fruit and seed set alone are unreliable indicators of individual differences in the maternal component of fitness in L. latifolia, and a review of relevant literature indicates that this probably applies to other polycarpic plants as well. Plant reproductive biology studies may make erroneous inferences if they consider exclusively data on relative fruit and seed set, and neglect the absolute components of individual differences in fecundity. It is proposed that, to circumvent these potential problems, demographic aspects and absolute estimates of seed output on a per individual basis should be examined in addition to the customarily employed fruit and seed set measures.

TI  - Geographically structured and temporally unstable growth responses of Juniperus thurifera to recent climate variability in the Iberian Peninsula
PY  - 2011
AB  - Geographically structured tree-ring networks are needed to fully understand the spatiotemporal variability in climatic sensitiveness of trees and to study their future responses to global warming. We aim to identify the spatially constrained structure of radial-growth patterns of the Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera L.) and to assess whether their climate–growth responses were unstable during the late twentieth century. Tree–ring width chronologies were built for 13 J.thurifera stands in Spain using dendrochronological methods and related to monthly climatic data. Sites were grouped according to their growth patterns using hierarchical cluster analysis. The relationships among geographical, climatic and stand features and their influence on radial growth were evaluated using redundancy analysis. The climate–growth relationships and their temporal stability were assessed using Pearson’s and moving bootstrapped correlations, respectively. Stands formed three geographical groups according to their high-frequency growth variation: North West and Centre, North East and South East. We found that J. thurifera radial-growth patterns depended on geographical and climatic factors, but not on the stand structure, and responded to a northwest–southeast gradient of decreasing rainfall and influence of Atlantic Westerlies and Mediterranean cyclonic activity. The positive response to June precipitation was unstable during the late twentieth century and started earlier in populations from western mesic sites than in eastern xeric sites. This pattern may be related to either decreasing water availability in western than in eastern sites or the resilience of J. thurifera growth from xeric sites in response to the increasing summer aridity.

TI  - Geographical variation in seed production, predation and abortion in Juniperus communis throughout its range in Europe
PY  - 2000
AB  - Summary

1 The geographical variation of seed production, predation and abortion was analysed in Juniperus communis for 31 populations in seven distinct regions throughout the species’ distribution range in Europe, including both the northern and southern boundaries.



2 The number of seeds per cone and the number of filled seeds per cone varied significantly between geographical regions and among populations within regions. Populations from the Mediterranean mountains (south-east Spain) showed the highest values in the number of seeds per cone but the lowest values in the number of filled seeds per cone.



3 Losses due to predispersal seed predation varied significantly among populations within a region but not between regions, suggesting that predation incidence depends on local-scale factors. Seed abortion rates were higher in southern Iberian populations than in the other regions, and varied significantly among populations and regions. As a result of predation and abortion, seed production was lowest in the Iberian regions.



4 Seed abortion showed a significant quadratic relationship with latitude, with higher values of abortion at either end of the gradient, but particularly at the southern limit.



5 The production of filled seeds declined gradually towards both northern and southern distribution limits. In the Mediterranean mountains (southern limit), low seed production coincided with a marked limitation placed upon natural regeneration by summer drought, leading to a demographic bottleneck in populations. Although seed abortion levels were relatively high in the subarctic tundra (northern limit) populations, they were free from predispersal seed predators, suggesting that population viability here may be under less pressure.

TI  - Estimating acorn crops using visual surveys
PY  - 1994
AB  - We describe a visual survey technique for evaluating acorn production. In contrast with previously proposed methods, our technique yields ratio-level data on annual productivity that are analyzable with standard statistics and, by sampling the same trees each year, data on the reproductive patterns of individual trees. We compared this technique with two independent sets of acorn-trap data acquired on oaks of three species at Hastings Reservation in central coastal California. Correlations between acorns counted by the visual surveys and collected from acorn traps under the same trees were significant for all three species. Most scatter in the data appeared to be attributable to three causes: (1) sampling error, especially among trees with very small crops, (2) finite counting speed, leading to a lack of discrimination among trees with very large crops by the visual surveys, and (3) arboreal acorn removal by animals. This latter factor can be particularly large, rendering visual surveys more reliable than...

TI  - Changes in richness and abundance of rodents and native predators in response to extreme rainfall in arid Australia
PY  - 2013
AB  - The dramatic spatial and temporal variation in rainfall and the resource pulses which these trigger provide a challenge for predicting consumer-primary productivity dynamics especially in arid systems. In particular, understanding is needed of the degree to which boom-bust dynamics drive arid systems. Here, we assess the response of birds (diurnal raptors, nocturnal rodent-specialist raptors) and rodents to a resource pulse in the western Simpson Desert across a 43-month study period that finished in May 2011. Three rainfall pulses in rapid succession from February 2010 to March 2011 underpinned a ‘big rain’ event. Rodent populations irrupted within 6–9 months of the first of the three rainfall pulses (in February 2010). Two rodent-specialist raptors; the letter-winged kite, Elanus scriptus, and eastern barn owl, Tyto javanica, appeared in the area within 6–9 months of the start of the rodent irruption. By comparison with the rodents, barn owl and letter-winged kite, diurnal raptors responded rapidly to the February 2010 rainfall event. When comparing surveys carried out the week prior to the February rainfall event with May 2010, raptor richness increased from two to six species and the index of abundance, measured as mean sightings per km, increased from 0.07 to 1.34. These findings emphasize that the 2010–2011 resource pulse was an ecologically significant event. Our results confirmed the link between big rains and rodent irruptions but they also highlighted the occurrence of finer-scale temporal fluctuations that are less easily accounted for by rainfall patterning.

TI  - Evolutionary drivers of mast-seeding in a long-lived desert shrub
PY  - 2015
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY The evolutionary drivers and proximal regulators of mast-seeding are well understood for species of mesic environments, but how these regulators interact with high spatial and interannual variability in growing-season precipitation for a masting species in a desert environment has never been examined. METHOD We followed flowering and seed production in 16 populations of the North American desert shrub blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) from contrasting environments across its range over an 11-year period to determine patterns of interannual reproductive output variation. KEY RESULT Patterns of reproductive output in blackbrush did not track current growing season precipitation, but instead were regulated by prior-year weather cues. The strength of the response to the masting cue depended on habitat quality, with higher mean reproductive output, shorter intervals between years of high seed production, and lower CVp at more favorable sites. Wind pollination efficiency was demonstrated to be an important evolutionary driver of masting in blackbrush, and satiation of heteromyid seed predator-dispersers was supported as an evolutionary driver based on earlier studies. CONCLUSIONS Both the evolutionary drivers and proximal regulators of masting in blackbrush are similar to those demonstrated for masting species of mesic environments. Relatively low synchrony across populations in response to regional masting cues occurs at least partly because prior-year environmental cues can trigger masting efforts in years with resource limitation due to suboptimal precipitation, especially in more xeric low-elevation habitats.

TI  - What Induces Central Australian Arid Zone Trees and Shrubs to Flower and Fruit
PY  - 1993
AB  - We developed two sets of regression models for flowering and fruiting of arid zone trees and shrubs, based on (i) rainfall in the current and preceding seasons and (ii) soil moisture lagged over varying time periods combined with mean maximum temperature and daylength in the month prior to phenological observations. Using up to 4 years of flowering and fruiting records, we found that both approaches identified responses matching those reported in two other long-term data sets or in the literature, for some species but not for all. The second approach appeared to provide better correlations than the first but we were unable to predict flowering and fruiting effectively. Flowering and fruiting of central Australian trees and shrubs were least in late summer, creating potential limitations on animal populations dependent on them for food. With better predictive capabilities, there is some scope for managing the trees and shrubs for particular purposes. However, very long-term phenological records are needed to improve predictions.

TI  - Effects of Rainfall and Temperature on the Distribution and Behavior of Larrea Tridentata (Creosote-Bush) in the Mojave Desert of Nevada
PY  - 1974
AB  - The effects of rainfall and temperature on the distribution and certain behavioral characteristics of Larrea tridentata (Creosote—bush) at and near its northern limits in the northern Mojave desert of southern Nevada, were investigated at 39 sites with Larrea and 20 sites without Larrea in eight drainage basins at elevations of 915—1,770 m over a 2,600—km2 area of the Nevada Test Site. Data used were (1) rainfall records for 9 yr (1963—71) for each site; (2) maximum and minimum air temperature records for each site, November 1962—February 1972; (3) percentage cover by all shrubs species and by Larrea; (4) height and density data for Larrea; and (5) percentage of germinable seeds from 29 of the Larrea populations for three seasons (1963—65) in relation to the seasonal rainfall for each site. Total percentage cover by all shrubs species is highly correlated with mean annual rainfall, less well correlated with elevation. Percentage cover by Larreafollows two patterns of relationship with rainfall: (1) where mean rainfall is low to intermediate, the same pattern as total shrub cover in relation to rainfall, and (2) on sites of high mean rainfall, consistently low cover, a function of low density of Larrea on these sites. In general, in undisturbed communities, the taller the Larrea plants the fewer there are of them, but the relationship is not strictly linear. Using height as an index to plant volume, numbers of Larrea plants are highly correlated with total plant volume. Mean height is not strongly correlated with mean annual rainfall or temperature parameters, but is well correlated with the ratio of mean precipitation/mean temperature. Tall plants (>1 m) occur in low density and on sites with high rainfall (mean 160—183 mm). The prevailing low minimum air temperatures and their extremes in the lowlands of enclosed drainage basins are inferred to be the primary cause of the absence of Larrea in three discrete vegetation zones (Atriplex confertifolia, Lycium pallidum, and L. shockleyi) in Frenchman Falt, and over most of the basin floor of Yucca Flat, where the communities are Atriplex and Grayia—Lycium andersonii. The year—round low minima in the lowlands of these basin result from nocturnal cold air drainage phenomena and formation of a cold air layer of variable depth.Average extreme minima on these sites were mostly below O° F; the extreme minimum was —18° F in one of the Atriplex communities of Frenchman Flat. Larrea occurs over the bajadas of Frenchman Flat on sites above the lower layers of cold air. In Yucca Flat, at its northern limits, it is restricted to certain upper bajada sites and notably one site on the basin floor. Average extreme minimum air temperatures on all Larrea sites were above 1°F; the absolute minimum was —8°F. Upper altitudinal limits of Larrea apparently are not determined by minimum temperatures since minima (including the extremes) in Coleogyne vegetation, which replaces Larrea altidudinally on the slopes, are well within the range of those recorded on Larrea sites. There is no pattern of relationship between maximum temperatures and the distribution of Larrea, although the highest extreme maxima usually occur on non—Larrea sites in the lowlands of Frenchman Flat. Mean annual rainfall on the Larrea sites ranged from 118 to 183 mm. Altitudinal and latitudinal limits of Larrea coincide with a maximum mean rainfall of 183 mm. Mean altitudinal rainfall of 160—183 mm appears to be critical to the behavior of Larrea. Germination trials support the inference of a deleterious effect of high rainfall on Larrea populations through time: there were high correlation coefficients (negative or positive, depending on the year) between the rainfall of the effective rainfall season and the percentage of germinable seeds; highest mean germination percentages (20%—60%) occurrred with 80—150 mm of seasonal rain, and either lower or higher seasonal rainfall resulted in lower percentages of germinable seeds (0%—20%).

TI  - A comparison of observation-level random effect and Beta-Binomial models for modelling overdispersion in Binomial data in ecology & evolution
PY  - 2015
AB  - Overdispersion is a common feature of models of biological data, but researchers often fail to model the excess variation driving the overdispersion, resulting in biased parameter estimates and standard errors. Quantifying and modeling overdispersion when it is present is therefore critical for robust biological inference. One means to account for overdispersion is to add an observation-level random effect (OLRE) to a model, where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that can absorb the extra-parametric variation in the data. Although some studies have investigated the utility of OLRE to model overdispersion in Poisson count data, studies doing so for Binomial proportion data are scarce. Here I use a simulation approach to investigate the ability of both OLRE models and Beta-Binomial models to recover unbiased parameter estimates in mixed effects models of Binomial data under various degrees of overdispersion. In addition, as ecologists often fit random intercept terms to models when the random effect sample size is low (<5 levels), I investigate the performance of both model types under a range of random effect sample sizes when overdispersion is present. Simulation results revealed that the efficacy of OLRE depends on the process that generated the overdispersion; OLRE failed to cope with overdispersion generated from a Beta-Binomial mixture model, leading to biased slope and intercept estimates, but performed well for overdispersion generated by adding random noise to the linear predictor. Comparison of parameter estimates from an OLRE model with those from its corresponding Beta-Binomial model readily identified when OLRE were performing poorly due to disagreement between effect sizes, and this strategy should be employed whenever OLRE are used for Binomial data to assess their reliability. Beta-Binomial models performed well across all contexts, but showed a tendency to underestimate effect sizes when modelling non-Beta-Binomial data. Finally, both OLRE and Beta-Binomial models performed poorly when models contained <5 levels of the random intercept term, especially for estimating variance components, and this effect appeared independent of total sample size. These results suggest that OLRE are a useful tool for modelling overdispersion in Binomial data, but that they do not perform well in all circumstances and researchers should take care to verify the robustness of parameter estimates of OLRE models.

TI  - Studies of the Flowering Season and Fruit Production of some Arid Zone Shrubs and Trees in Western Australia
PY  - 1976
AB  - The C.S.I.R.O. Division of Wildlife Research has been studying the biology of emus, Dromaius novaehollandiae Latham, since 1959. Early in the study it was found that the birds fed extensively upon the flowers, fruits and seeds of a number of native shrubs. Therefore individual plants of a number of species were marked and their flowering periods and fruit production were followed up to 1972. Some of the results of these studies have already been published (Davies 1968, 1969, 1973). The present paper presents additional results about the species dealt with earlier, as well as presenting results from other species. Several authors have studied arid zone shrubs in Western Australia, notably Melville (1947), Wilcox (1960) and Hellmuth (1971), and comparable studies have been made in South Australia (Hall, Specht & Eardley 1964), the Northern Territory (Maconochie 1973) and New South Wales (Preece 1971a, b). Other references are given in papers contributed to a Symposium entitled 'The Mulga Lands of Australia' and published as volume 7, No. 1, of the journal Tropical Grasslands.

TI  - Large fires, fire effects and the fire-regime concept
PY  - 2008
AB  - ‘Large’ fires may be declared so because of their absolute or relative area. Huge fires – with areas of more than 106 ha (104 km2) have occurred across a wide spectrum of Australian environments and are known on other continents. Such large fires are rare whereas fires with much smaller areas are common. Large fires are initiated by single or multiple ignitions and become large because of some combination of: rapid rates of spread; long ‘life’; merging, and failure of initial suppression operations. Fires as ecological ‘events’ occur within a ‘regime’ – an historical series. Both events and regimes have effects that may be discerned in terms of water, land, air or organisms. What have been regarded as the components of ‘regimes’ have differed between observers, the main issue being whether or not spatial variables need to be included; ‘area’ involvement is briefly addressed. The current trend toward fire-regime control through fuel treatment, including management (prescribed) burning, and fire suppression may be expected to continue. These trends, among others, can be expected to change fire regimes. What is regarded as ‘large’ among fires may change as the planet becomes increasingly human-dominated.

TI  - Snow Tussocks, Chaos, and the Evolution of Mast Seeding
PY  - 2002
AB  - One hitherto intractable problem in studying mast seed- ing (synchronous intermittent heavy flowering by a population of perennial plants) is determining the relative roles of weather, plant reserves, and evolutionary selective pressures such as predator sati- ation. We parameterize a mechanistic resource-based model for mast seeding in Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae) using a long-term individ- ually structured data set. Each plant's energy reserves were recon- structed using annual inputs (growing degree days), outputs (flow- ering), and a novel regression technique. This allowed the estimation of the parameters that control internal plant resource dynamics, and thereby allowed different models for masting to be tested against each other. Models based only on plant size, season degree days, and/ or climatic cues (warm January temperatures) fail to reproduce the pattern of autocovariation in individual flowering and the high levels of flowering synchrony seen in the field. This shows that resource- matching or simple cue-based models cannot account for this ex- ample of mast seeding. In contrast, the resource-based model pulsed by a simple climate cue accurately describes both individual-level and population-level aspects of the data. The fitted resource-based model, in the absence of environmental forcing, has chaotic (but often statistically periodic) dynamics. Environmental forcing syn- chronizes individual reproduction, and the models predict highly variable seed production in close agreement with the data. An evo- lutionary model shows that the chaotic internal resource dynamics, as predicted by the fitted model, is selectively advantageous provided that adult mortality is low and seeds survive for more than 1 yr, both of which are true for C. pallens. Highly variable masting and chaotic dynamics appear to be advantageous in this case because they reduce seed losses to specialist seed predators, while balancing the costs of missed reproductive events.

TI  - Nonviable seed set enhances plant fitness: the sacrificial sibling hypothesis
PY  - 2009
AB  - Many tree species produce far more fruits than eventually mature, with a large proportion of developing fruits being aborted midway through the development process. Whether this is a maternally controlled late-acting self-incompatibility mechanism, or an expression of inbreeding depression, is difficult to determine. In either case, however, selection is expected to favor early abortion of inbred or incompatible zygotes to minimize loss of resources. In many species, this does not occur, suggesting the possibility of adaptive reasons for retaining selfed or inbred seeds that are aborted at relatively late developmental stages. We propose that such seeds serve an important function in diluting the impact of pre-dispersal seed predators by acting as seed predator sinks and thereby increasing the survival probabilities of outcrossed and fully viable seeds. We suggest that selfed seeds retained and developed through the periods of seed predator attack are effectively offered and sacrificed for the benefit of outcrossed seeds.

TI  - Desert small mammal responses to wildfire and predation in the aftermath of a La Nińa driven resource pulse
PY  - 2013
AB  - In arid Australia, flooding rains associated with the La Nina phase of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prompt dramatic pulses of primary productivity, which in turn result in irruptions of rodents and their predators. When it is dry, the dense vegetation produced by extreme rainfall events can fuel extensive wildfires. In this study we investigated the effects of a wildfire that followed exceptional rainfalls associated with the La Nina event of 2010–2011 on small mammal assemblages in a stony (gibber) desert ecosystem in central Australia. When the study commenced in July 2011, there was dense grass cover and rodents, particularly, Rattus villosissimus occurred at high abundance. Mammalian predator activity was high throughout the study period and predators primarily consumed rodents. A wildfire in October 2011, reduced grass cover but there was no effect of fire on the abundance or species richness of small mammals, immediately after the wildfire or 11 months after the wildfire. Following the fire event, grass cover increased on both burnt and unburnt grids, but did not reach the levels recorded prior to the wildfire. Small mammal abundance and species richness declined steadily during the study irrespective of the occurrence of wildfire. At 6 and 11 months after the wildfire there was no difference in grass cover on burnt and unburnt grids and Rattus villosissimus were absent. Our results show that the removal of vegetation by wildfire was not a major driver of small mammal assemblage structure in this stony desert ecosystem. Our results are consistent with the predictions of ecosystem organization models that describe switching trophic control along gradients of resource productivity and support the notion that the decline of small mammals was driven by the onset of top-down control by abundant predators coupled with diminished availability of food resources.

TI  - Resource pulses, switching trophic control, and the dynamics of small mammal assemblages in arid Australia
PY  - 2011
AB  - Small mammal assemblages in the aridlands of the Southern Hemisphere often have wildly fluctuating dynamics. Previous studies have attributed these fluctuations to climate-driven pulses in food resources resulting in the switching of trophic control from bottom-up (food-limited) to top-down (predation-limited) population regulation, and vice versa. In this study we use a meta-analytic approach to evaluate the evidence for the phenomenon of switching trophic control. If shifting trophic control is a unifying phenomenon that shapes small mammal assemblages in arid Australia, we would expect the abundance and species richness of small mammals to increase with increasing primary productivity and the abundance of small mammals to decrease with increasing predator abundances, which lag behind those of small mammals. We tested these predictions using data compiled from 6 unpublished and 2 published data sets containing time series (3–11 years) of small mammal and predator community dynamics. Our analyses provide moderate support for the notion that switching trophic control is a unifying phenomenon shaping small mammal assemblages. Also, our results provide evidence that top-down and bottom-up control are not mutually exclusive phenomena driving desert small mammal assemblages but rather alternative ecosystem states that exist along a rainfall-driven continuum of ecosystem energy flux through time.

TI  - Effectiveness of predator satiation in masting oaks is negatively affected by conspecific density
PY  - 2018
AB  - Variation in seed availability shapes plant communities, and is strongly affected by seed predation. In some plant species, temporal variation in seed production is especially high and synchronized over large areas, which is called ‘mast seeding’. One selective advantage of this phenomenon is predator satiation which posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, and satiation in mast years. However, even though seed predation can be predicted to have a strong spatial component and depend on plant densities, whether the effectiveness of predator satiation in masting plants changes according to the Janzen-Connell effect has been barely investigated. We studied, over an 8-year period, the seed production, the spatiotemporal patters of weevil seed predation, and the abundance of adult weevils in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) population that consists of trees interspersed at patches covering a continuum of conspecific density. Isolated oaks effectively satiate predators, but this is trumped by increasing conspecific plant density. Lack of predator satiation in trees growing in dense patches was caused by re-distribution of insects among plants that likely attenuated them against food shortage in lean years, and changed the type of weevil functional response from type II in isolated trees to type III in trees growing in dense patches. This study provides the first empirical evaluation of the notion that masting and predator satiation should be more important in populations that start to dominate their communities, and is consistent with the observation that masting is less frequent and less intense in diverse forests.

TI  - Proximate causes and possible adaptive functions of mast seeding and barren flower shows in spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) in arid regions of Australia
PY  - 2014
AB  - Mast seeding, the intermittent production of large synchronised seed crops among plant populations, is a phenomenon that occurs at exceptionally long intervals in spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) from arid regions of Australia. This is despite the reliance of these fire-sensitive plants on seeds for post-fire regeneration, and that spinifex grasslands rate among Australia’s most flammable ecosystems. The proximate causes and possible adaptive functions of masting in seven species of spinifex from arid regions within the 350-mm rainfall isohyet were investigated. Specifically, the seed set percentages of 79 specimens collected between 1947 and 2012 were related to the following environmental covariates: antecedent rainfall over 6, 12 and 36 months, relative humidity, and the number of days above 40°C and below 0°C during anthesis. Given the potential importance of seeding events for post-fire regeneration, it was also investigated whether masting in Triodia could represent a fire-related form of environmentally predictive masting, by testing whether high-yield years corresponded to years of increased fire occurrence. Examination of the dataset showed that 43% of specimens contained completely aborted inflorescences (0% seed fill), while seed set ranged from 2 to 69% in the remaining specimens. High levels of insect activity were also found, with 42% of specimens showing evidence of insect occupation. Statistical analyses showed that the main environmental driver of seed set was high precipitation over the previous 12 months, and that high-yield years were strongly related to years of increased fire likelihood. The number of days over 40°C was a weakly significant driver of yield, while the remaining covariates were not significant. It is hypothesised that intermittent reproduction by Triodia is a fire-related form of environmentally predictive masting, which maximises chances of post-fire regeneration by satiating seed predators during flammable periods (i.e. after heavy rain years). Furthermore, it is suggested that non-viable flower crops after initial low rainfalls may have an adaptive function, by diluting pre-dispersal seed predator densities with ‘decoy’ ovules that do not mature and lead to the starvation of developing larvae.

PY  - 2006
AB  - General flowering is a community-wide masting phenomenon, which is thus far documented only in aseasonal tropical forests in Asia. Although the canopy and emergent layers of forests in this region are dominated by species of a single family, Dipterocarpaceae, general flowering involves various plant groups. Studying proximate factors and estimating the flowering patterns of the past and future may aid our understanding of the ecological significance and evolutionary factors behind this phenomenon. Here we show that this phenomenon is most likely triggered by irregular droughts based on 10 years of

TI  - ENSO and frost codetermine decade-long temporal variation in flower and seed production in a subtropical rain forest
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary

Flower and seed production of plants can be greatly influenced by both natural climatic oscillations and local weather extremes. However, owing to the rarity of long-term monitoring studies conducted at a sufficient temporal scale to capture climatic oscillations and the unpredictability of extreme weather events, evidence that demonstrates how these two external forcings act in concert to drive plant reproduction remains scarce.
In addition, considerable variation in species' phenological responses to the external climatic forcings was often observed. Phylogenetic relationships may mediate this interspecific variation, but previous studies yielded inconsistent results when testing this hypothesis.
We monitored the flower and seed production in a subtropical rain forest, Fushan, Taiwan (24°45′N, 121°35′E), for over 10 years (since September 2002). In March 2005, a record low temperature (−1.3 °C) occurred at Fushan and caused great frost damage to plants. We used weekly phenological records and long-term meteorological data to assess the effects of climatic fluctuations and extreme weather event on plant reproductive output.
We show that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices, which integrated local climatic variables at Fushan over several months, were strongly associated with flower and seed production. The 2005 spring frost also had long-lasting effects on the flower and seed production of several species.
In particular, we detected phylogenetic signals in the relationships between phenological responses of flowering production and several climatic variables (maximum temperature, irradiance and ENSO34 index). By contrast, the relationships between seed production and climatic variables, as well as phenological responses to the frost event, did not exhibit a phylogenetic signal.
Synthesis. Our findings add to the growing evidence that together the natural climatic oscillation (ENSO) and the extreme weather event (frost) determined the temporal variation in flower and seed production. In addition, phylogenetically closely related species resembled each other in their flowering responses to abiotic variation in this subtropical rain forest. Improved understanding of these abiotic and biotic interactions may help predicting population- and community-level phenological responses under future climate changes.

TI  - Population dynamics and environemental changes during natural irruptions of Australian desert rodents.
PY  - 1994
AB  - Populations of Pseudomys hermannsburgensis and Notomys alexis were studied during a 33-month period (January 1991 to September 1993) in a sand-dune habitat in south-western Queensland. Population numbers of both species fluctuated dramatically over time with an approximately 40-fold difference between periods of lowest and highest abundance. Increased numbers were due primarily to an influx of juveniles to the population. A high turnover of individuals in both populations resulted in low rates of recapture. Numbers of both species were correlated positively with an index of rainfall with a time-lag of four months. P. hermannsburgensis showed spatial and temporal correlations with seed availability, whereas N. alexis displayed a strong, but non-significant, temporal trend with seed availability. These data suggest strongly that natural irruptions of Australian desert rodents are triggered by rainfall and possibly rain-induced food availability.

TI  - The soil seed bank of Triodia basedowii in relation to time since fire
PY  - 1988
AB  - Triodia basedowii seeds were found almost exclusively within Triodia hummocks, both in the centres and under the edges. Averaged over the whole ground surface, live seed densities in soil and litter were 85-263 m−2 in stands which had been burnt 9 and > 35 years previously. These live seeds comprised only 56% of all filled grains, and in turn filled grains were present in only about 6% of all fruits. Thus > 4% of fruits contained live seeds. A site burnt 1 year previously had about 35 live seeds m−2 still ungerminated, but at sites burnt 3 years previously none of the pre-fire seed bank was alive. After fire, juvenile plants were found predominantly around the edges of where hummocks had been before the fire, suggesting that seeds survive fires better around the edges.

TI  - Fire timing in relation to masting: an important determinant of post-fire recruitment success for the obligate-seeding arid zone soft spinifex (Triodia pungens).
PY  - 2017
AB  - Plant species with fire-triggered germination are common in many fire-prone ecosystems. For such plants, fire timing in relation to the timing of reproduction may strongly influence post-fire population regeneration if: (a) flowering occurs infrequently (e.g. plants are mast seeders); and (b) seed survival rates are low and input from the current year's flowering therefore contributes a large proportion of the viable dormant seedbank. The role of fire timing in relation to masting as a driver of post-fire recruitment has rarely been examined directly, so this study tested the hypothesis that fires shortly after masting trigger increased recruitment of the obligate-seeding arid zone spinifex, Triodia pungens R. Br., an iteroparous masting grass with smoke-cued germination. Phenological monitoring of T. pungens was conducted over 5 years, while a longitudinal seedbank study assessed the influence of seeding events on soil-stored seedbank dynamics. Concurrently, a fire experiment with randomized blocking was undertaken to test whether T. pungens hummocks burnt shortly after masting have greater post-fire recruitment than hummocks burnt when there has not been recent input of seeds. Triodia pungens flowered in all years, though most flowerings were characterized by high rates of flower abortion. A mast flowering with high seed set in 2012 triggered approx. 200-fold increases in seedbank densities, and seedbank densities remained elevated for 24 months after this event. The fire experiment showed significantly higher recruitment around hummocks burnt 6 months after the 2012 mast event than around hummocks that were burnt but prevented from masting by having inflorescences clipped. Fires shortly after masting trigger mass recruitment in T. pungens because such fires synchronize an appropriate germination cue (smoke) with periods when seedbank densities are elevated. Interactions between natural fire regimes, seedbank dynamics and fire management prescriptions must be considered carefully when managing fire-sensitive masting plants such as T. pungens.

TI  - Long‐term seed survival and dispersal dynamics in a rodent‐dispersed tree: testing the predator satiation hypothesis and the predator dispersal hypothesis
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Mast seeding in animal-dispersed plants has previously been accounted for by two main hypotheses: the predator satiation hypothesis (that it increases seed survival and establishment before dispersal) and the predator dispersal hypothesis (that it increases seed dispersal or dispersal distance). However, neither hypothesis has been rigorously tested with simultaneous data on seed production, seed predation and seed dispersal by vertebrate seed predators. 2. We studied oil tea Camellia oleifera (Theaceae) seed production for eight years (2002–2009) in a subtropical forest in south-west China, and investigated how annual seed and rodent abundance determined per capita seed availability for rodent seed predators and seed dispersers and how seed and rodent abundance were related to seed dispersal and seed survival via scatter-hoarding. We predicted the patterns of seed dispersal and survival to test the two hypotheses about mast seeding. Edward’s long-tailed rat Leopoldamys edwardsi acted as the principal seed disperser of oil tea seeds because of scatter-hoarding, while other sympatric rodent species acted only as seed predators. 3. We first provided a reasonable method to estimate per capita seed availability based on annual seed abundance and annual metabolic rodent abundance (corrected for metabolic-scaling body mass of each rodent species). We found that annual seed abundance, annual metabolic rodent abundance and per capita seed availability all had some significant effects on different estimators of seed fates (including dispersal distances) across each stage from seedfall to seedling establishment. Both annual seed abundance and per capita seed availability were positively correlated with pre-dispersal seed survival, but negatively correlated with scatter-hoarding (and recaching), seed survival after dispersal and dispersal distances. However, annual metabolic rodent abundance had a positive effect on scatter-hoarding, but had a negative effect on the time to cache recovery. 4. Synthesis. Since greater seed production was associated with improvement in pre-dispersal survival of oil tea seeds but a reduction in dispersal (including secondary dispersal and dispersal distance), our long-term study indicates that, compared with the predator dispersal hypothesis, the predator satiation hypothesis provides a better mechanism predicting seed dispersal and seed survival in animal-dispersed plants by integrating seed abundance and animal abundance.

TI  - Relationships between fire severity and recruitment in arid grassland dominated by the obligate-seeding soft spinifex (Triodia pungens)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Fire intensity is recognised as an important driver of regeneration dynamics in forest and shrubland vegetation types, but its effects on recruitment processes in arid grasslands are poorly understood. Here, we used fire severity as a surrogate measure of fire intensity, and compared post-fire seedling recruitment from arid Triodia pungens (soft spinifex) plots burnt by low-severity experimental fires against those burnt by a high-severity wildfire. To explain T. pungens recruitment patterns, we also: (1) conducted a longitudinal depth distribution study of soil seedbank densities, and (2) carried out a lethal-temperature experiment on T. pungens seeds. High-severity burning was associated with reduced T. pungens recruitment compared with low-severity fire, and this relationship was attributed to the low lethal temperature thresholds of seeds and the adverse impacts of elevated soil temperatures during high-severity fire on the shallow soil seedbank. Among other species in the community, there were varied recruitment responses to fire severity. Overall, our results indicate that a strong link exists between fire severity and recruitment in arid spinifex grassland, though the association is variable among species, and dependent on the seedbank attributes, germination biologies and lethal-temperature thresholds of seeds of individual species.

TI  - From theory to experiments for testing the proximate mechanisms of mast seeding: an agenda for an experimental ecology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Highly variable and synchronised production of seeds by plant populations, known as masting, is implicated in many important ecological processes, but how it arises remains poorly understood. The lack of experimental studies prevents underlying mechanisms from being explicitly tested, and thereby precludes meaningful predictions on the consequences of changing environments for plant reproductive patterns and global vegetation dynamics. Here we review the most relevant proximate drivers of masting and outline a research agenda that takes the biology of masting from a largely observational field of ecology to one rooted in mechanistic understanding. We divide the experimental framework into three main processes: resource dynamics, pollen limitation and genetic and hormonal regulation, and illustrate how specific predictions about proximate mechanisms can be tested, highlighting the few successful experiments as examples. We envision that the experiments we outline will deliver new insights into how and why masting patterns might respond to a changing environment.

TI  - FIRE MANAGEMENT OF RANGELANDS IN THE KIMBERLEY LOW-RAINFALL ZONE: A REVIEW
PY  - 1999
AB  - This paper examines a range of environmental, research and practical issues affecting fire management of pastoral lands in the southern part of the Kimberley region in Western Australia. Although spinifex grasslands dominate most leases, smaller areas of more productive pastures are crucially important to many enterprises. There is a lack of local documentation of burning practices during traditional Aboriginal occupation; general features of the fire regime at that time can be suggested on the basis of information from other inland areas. Definition of current tire regimes is improving through interpretation of NOAA-AVHRR satellite imagery. Irregular extensive wildfires appear to dominate, although this should be confirmed by further accumulation, validation and analysis of fire history data. While these fires cause ma,jor difficulties. controlled burn~ng is a necessary part of station management. Although general management guidelines have been published. local research into tire-grazing effects has been very limited. For spinifex pastures, reconimendations are generally consistent with those applying elsewhere in northern Australia. They favour periodic burning of mature spinifex late in the year, before or shortly after the arrival of the first rains, with deferment of grazing. At that time. days of high fire danger may still be expected and prediction of fire behaviour is critical to burning decisions. Early dry-season burning is also required for creating protective tire breaks and to prepare for burning later in the year. Further development of tools for predicting fire behaviour, suited to the discontinuous fuels characteristic of the area, would be warranted. A range of questions concerning the timing and spatial pattern of burning, control of post-fire grazing, and the economics of fire management, should be addressed as resources permit. This can be done through a combination of opportunistic studies, modelling and documentation of local experience. The development of an expert system should be considered to assist in planning and conducting burning activities. Key words: Kimberley, fire regimes, fire management, pastoralism, spinifex

TI  - Staggered flowering in the Dipterocarpaceae: new insights into floral induction and the evolution of mast fruiting in the aseasonal tropics
PY  - 1988
AB  - The supra-annual mast fruiting of dipterocarps, dominant trees of Far Eastern lowland rain forests, has been considered an adaptation to reduce seed predation through satiation. However, this explanation raises four important questions. (1) What pollinates species that flower at intervals of more than one year? (2) How do mass-flowering species avoid competition for pollinators? (3) What is the environmental cue for floral induction that induces scores of species in several families to flower at irregular intervals of more than one year in an aseasonal climate? (4) And, most important, what factors could cause an initial phenological aggregation of species' fruiting times? Once such a phenological core of species exists, selection for predator satiation could entrain other species into the same fruiting schedule and perfect the synchrony of seed release. The essential question is how such a phenological core of species, flowering at irregular intervals in an aseasonal climate, could initially arise. The o...

TI  - Mast fruiting and ENSO cycles - does the cue betray a cause?
PY  - 2002
AB  - Evidence is mounting that flowering by the mast-fruiting Dipterocarpaceae in Southeast Asia is triggered by ENSO events such that seeds are dispersed at the end of ENSO droughts. These droughts induce substantial defoliation and mortality of canopy trees, producing a favorable environment for seedling recruitment in the forest understory. Therefore, seedling release following droughts may have selected for synchronized, supra-annual fruiting in these rain forests. Currently, mast fruiting in Southeast Asia is generally regarded as an evolutionary response to seed predation by nomadic vertebrates. Separating the two causes for mast fruiting, seedling release and predator satiation, may be difficult if they are coupled in nature by ENSO droughts. Nevertheless, if the cue for masting is environmental, then the post-ENSO seedling environment should be considered a potential cause for masting, and if it operates in conjunction with predator satiation, then it may have provided the initial stimulus for supra-annual synchrony in fruiting.

TI  - Coexistence of shrubs and grass in a semi-arid landscape: a case study of mulga (Acacia aneura, Mimosaceae) shrublands embedded in fire-prone spinifex (Triodia pungens, Poaceae) hummock grasslands.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The persistence of relatively fire-sensitive mulga (Acacia aneura F.Muell. ex Benth., Mimosaceae) shrublands within a landscape matrix of highly flammable spinifex (Triodia spp. R.Br., Poaceae) hummock grassland is a central question in the ecology of semiarid Australia. It is also a special case of questions about the coexistence of grasses and woody plants that have general application in semiarid rangelands and tropical savannas. With the use of field surveys and a 24-year fire history, we examined their coexistence on a sandplain in the Tanami Desert, Northern Territory, Australia. Mulga and spinifex each formed discrete monodominant stands with generally abrupt boundaries that did not correspond to obvious edaphic or topographic discontinuities. Spinifex hummock grasslands burnt almost three times as often as mulga shrublands and tended to occur on lighter soils with less biological crusting and more physical soil crusting. A combination of fire and soil variables described the environmental partitioning better than did either alone. Biological crusting increased with time since fire in both vegetation types. The demographic structure of mulga stands reflected their fire history, the more frequently burnt stands comprising almost entirely small plants. One fifth of mulga plants <0.5 m tall were resprouts. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that abrupt boundaries between mulga shrublands and spinifex hummock grasslands can be generated across diffuse environmental gradients by fire–soil–vegetation feedback loops. The oft-severe demographic impact of fire on mulga that is burnt raises questions about the appropriateness of frequent intense fires in this landscape.

TI  - Advantages of masting in European beech: timing of granivore satiation and benefits of seed caching support the predator dispersal hypothesis
PY  - 2015
AB  - The predator satiation and predator dispersal hypotheses provide alternative explanations for masting. Both assume satiation of seed-eating vertebrates. They differ in whether satiation occurs before or after seed removal and caching by granivores (predator satiation and predator dispersal, respectively). This difference is largely unrecognized, but it is demographically important because cached seeds are dispersed and often have a microsite advantage over nondispersed seeds. We conducted rodent exclosure experiments in two mast and two nonmast years to test predictions of the predator dispersal hypothesis in our study system of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica). Specifically, we tested whether the fraction of seeds removed from the forest floor is similar during mast and nonmast years (i.e., lack of satiation before seed caching), whether masting decreases the removal of cached seeds (i.e., satiation after seed storage), and whether seed caching increases the probability of seedling emergence. We found that masting did not result in satiation at the seed removal stage. However, masting decreased the removal of cached seeds, and seed caching dramatically increased the probability of seedling emergence relative to noncached seeds. European beech thus benefits from masting through the satiation of scatterhoarders that occurs only after seeds are removed and cached. Although these findings do not exclude other evolutionary advantages of beech masting, they indicate that fitness benefits of masting extend beyond the most commonly considered advantages of predator satiation and increased pollination efficiency.

TI  - Fire after a mast year triggers mass recruitment of slender mulga (Acacia aptaneura), a desert shrub with heat-stimulated germination
PY  - 2017
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Fire typically triggers extensive regeneration of plants with heat-stimulated germination by causing short periods of intense soil heating. If plants with heat-stimulated germination are also subject to seed predation and display mast-seeding cycles, postfire recruitment may be contingent on the seedfall density of prefire masts, and on whether granivores are satiated at the time of fire.

TI  - Masting in a temperate tree: Evidence for environmental prediction?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Many plant species produce large fruit crops in some years and then produce few or no fruits in others. Synchronous, inter-annual variation in plant reproduction is known as ‘masting’ and its adaptive significance has yet to be fully resolved. For 8 consecutive years, I quantified every fruit produced by 22 females of a New Zealand tree species (Dysoxylum spectabile), which has an unusual habit of taking a full calendar year to mature fruits after flowering. Fruit production varied strongly among years and was tightly synchronized among trees. Annual variability in fruit production declined with total reproductive output, indicating trees with lower fecundity exhibited a stronger tendency to mast. Although unrelated to temperature, annual fruit production was positively related to precipitation during annual periods of fruit development, and negatively related to fruit production in the previous year. Seedlings had higher rates of survivorship in a wet, high-seed year than in a dry, low-seed year, suggesting that seedlings might be drought sensitive. Therefore, D. spectabile produced large fruit crops during periods of high rainfall prior to fruit maturation, which may enhance survivorship of drought-intolerant seeds. Results were inconsistent with several hypotheses that are widely believed to be the most likely explanations for masting. Instead, results were consistent with the environmental prediction hypothesis, suggesting that this hypothesis may be more important than previously appreciated.

TI  - Effects of Supplementary Soil Nutrients on Hummock Grasses
PY  - 1994
AB  - Hummocks of Triodia basedowii E. Pritz, T. pungens R.Br. and Plectrachne schinzii Henr. were treated with ash and with standard and high applications of slow-release fertiliser. Following rain and the ensuing growth and flowering, the soils and the hummocks were sampled for biomass and for nutrient content, and compared to controls. In a similar but separate experiment, seed set in inflorescences was assessed for hummocks treated with standard fertiliser application, for hummocks treated by removal of neighbouring hummocks, and for controls. In the absence of nutrient addition, total topsoil nitrogen concentration was higher under hummocks than outside, whereas total topsoil phosphorus concentration was lower under hummocks than outside. The absolute amount of phosphorus in the hummock itself was insufficient to account for the depletion of phosphorus in topsoil under the hummock. Available soil phosphorus was about 1-4% of total phosphorus, and was generally highest towards the edge of hummocks. Additions of ash did not significantly affect soil nutrients, while addition of fertiliser produced substantial increases in total nitrogen and in available and total phosphorus. The increases did not extend to the area surrounding the hummock. The increases in soil nutrients did not result in significant increases in new green growth, or in inflorescence biomass or number. However, nutrients appear to have been taken up into the plants, including into old tissue, because there were increases in nutrient concentration in plant tissues, which sometimes were statistically significant and sometimes not. In the second experiment, neither increased soil nutrients nor removal of neighbours increased the number of inflorescences produced, or the proportion of florets that gave rise to filled grain.

TI  - The parasitoids of seed predators attacking snow tussocks, Chionochloa spp. (Poaceae).
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract We studied the parasitoids of three insect seed predators of the mast-seeding genus Chionochloa spp. (snow tussocks) at Mt Hutt, New Zealand. Megacraspedus calamogonus (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is parasitised by four species, three Hymenoptera (Zealachertus tortriciphaga [Eulophidae], Diadegma sp. [Ichneumonidae] and Dolichogenidea sp. [Braconidae]) and one Diptera (Uclesiella sp. [Tachinidae]). Diplotoxa similis (Diptera: Chloropidae) is parasitised by Callitula sp. (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). Eucalyptodiplosis chionochloae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is parasitised by two Hymenoptera, Gastrancistrus sp. (Pteromalidae) and Zelostemma chionochloae (Platygastridae); all three species have extended diapause. Overall parasitism was 68.5% in M. calamogonus, 1% in D. similis, and 41% in E. chionochloae. Such parasitism in M. calamogonus and E. chionochloae may reduce seed predation in Chionochloa and alter the selective benefit of mast seeding (predator satiation) to the plant. However, seed predation ...

TI  - Seedling emergence of hummock grasses in relation to the effects of fire.
PY  - 1990
AB  - The ecology of hummock-grass vegetation involves recurring fires. The hypothesis was tested that soil seed banks of hummock grass species are stimulated to germinate by the heat of fire or by ash addition. Hummocks of Plectrachne schinzii Henr., Triodia basedowii E. Pritz., and Triodia pungens R. Br. were burned, removed, or removed with the ash returned, and subsequent regeneration was recorded, in Ulum National Park. Regeneration of hummock grass was by seedlings only. Seedling emergence averaged 5/m2, with no differences between treatments or hummock grass species. This indicates the heat of fires and ash addition may not be important in stimulating seed germination of these hummock grass populations. Gemination was distributed over more than one rainfall event following the treatments.

TI  - Description of Eucalyptodiplosis chionochloae sp. nov., a cecidomyiid feeding on inflorescences of Chionochloa (Poaceae) in New Zealand
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract A cecidomyiid that feeds on developing seeds in the inflorescences of the New Zealand tussock grasses Chionochloa australis, C. conspicua, C. crassiuscula, C.flavescens, C. macra, C. oreophila, C. pallens, C. rigida, C. rubra, C. spiralis and C. teretifolia is formally described from C. pallens. The new species, named Eucalyptodiplosis chionochloae Kolesik, is the most ubiquitous of flower feeders of Chionochloa. Its larvae do not form galls but feed on the developing seeds in autumn, overwinter as diapausing larvae inside the floret, and pupate then rapidly eclose in summer, sometimes after extended diapause. Methods for rearing adults are described. Based on its morphological characters this species is most closely related to two described congeners that form galls on buds of Eucalyptus trees in Australia. Seed predation by Eucalyptodiplosis chionochloae larvae appears to be the primary driver of the extreme mast seeding (variation among years in flower crops) seen in the host Chionochloa species.

TI  - The role of rainfall and predators in determining synchrony in reproduction of savanna trees in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania
PY  - 2006
AB  - Summary


1
We examined the factors determining synchrony in reproduction in nine Acacia and six other tree species in the Serengeti ecosystem.

2
We test two hypotheses: (i) an abiotic hypothesis where the primary determinant of synchrony is an adaptation to water availability; and (ii) biotic hypotheses where these adaptations to water can be further refined by additional adaptations to avoid predators, or attract seed and fruit dispersers.

3
Flowering and fruiting were recorded monthly for individually marked trees during 1997–2004. Flowering in different species occurs semi-annually, annually or, in the case of one species, once every 2 years. For most species synchrony of flowering was correlated with seasonal rainfall, with lags related to the mean height of the species; small species flowered during the rains while larger species flowered in the dry season. Fruiting seasons occurred at the end of the rains irrespective of the flowering season.

4
Most species showed flowering synchrony greater than expected from the distribution of rainfall. This may be related to avoidance of insect seed predators through predator satiation. Two Acacias showed multi-annual fruiting (masting), possibly as a predator avoidance mechanism. Acacia tortilis has two flowering seasons: a dry season flowering with early abortion of pods and a wet season flowering producing successful fruits.

5
Two species of Commiphora appeared to be synchronized so as to attract birds that disperse seeds. Acacia tortilis produced indehiscent pods attractive to ungulates, possibly to kill bruchid beetles during digestion and so increase seed viability.

6
Our results suggest that synchrony in these trees is caused by a strong interaction between abiotic and biotic factors. Closely related species have different reproductive patterns of synchrony that seem to be adapted to different combinations of rainfall, predators and dispersers. Rainfall is the primary determinant but the activities of predators and dispersers increase the degree of synchrony.

TI  - Mechanisms of mast seeding: resources, weather, cues, and selection.
PY  - 2016
AB  - 546 I. 546 II. 547 III. 548 IV. 552 V. 554 VI. 556 VII. 558 VIII. 558 IX. 559 559 References 559 SUMMARY: Mast seeding is a widespread and widely studied phenomenon. However, the physiological mechanisms that mediate masting events and link them to weather and plant resources are still debated. Here, we explore how masting is affected by plant resource budgets, fruit maturation success, and hormonal coordination of cues including weather and resources. There is little empirical support for the commonly stated hypothesis that plants store carbohydrates over several years to expend in a high-seed year. Plants can switch carbohydrates away from growth in high-seed years, and seed crops are more probably limited by nitrogen or phosphorus. Resources are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving masting, but resource budget (RB) models cannot create masting in the absence of selection because some underlying selective benefit is required to set the level of a 'full' seed crop at greater than the annual resource increment. Economies of scale (EOSs) provide the ultimate factor selecting for masting, but EOSs probably always interact with resources, which modify the relationship between weather cues and reproduction. Thus, RB and EOS models are not alternative explanations for masting - both are required. Experiments manipulating processes that affect mast seeding will help clarify the physiological mechanisms that underlie mast seeding.

TI  - Long-term dynamics of rodent populations in arid Australia: the influence of rainfall
PY  - 1999
AB  - Populations of rodents were studied for periods of 7−9 years at each of three sites in arid Australia. All species fluctuated dramatically in abundance, being absent or in low numbers during droughts but erupting after significant rainfall. Strong correlations were obtained between capture rates and cumulative monthly rainfall residuals, with time lags, that had been modified by an exponential decay function to model the post-rain depletion of resources. The introduced Mus domesticus erupted within only two months of exceptional rainfall at one site, whereas the native rodents Notomys alexis, Pseudomys hermannsburgensis and P. desertor generally responded 3Œ10 months after rain. The faster response of M. domesticus reflects its high reproductive potential compared with the native rodents, and perhaps greater immigration. Differences in magnitudes and delays in response to rainfall among the native species were due probably to differences in initial population sizes and times available for response and, for P. desertor, to between-site differences in the quality or quantity of food resources. Population declines in all species during dry periods probably followed resource shortages. Despite the usually strong linkage between rainfall and population dynamics, rain failed to trigger population responses in rodents for prolonged periods at two of the sites, and was not clearly associated with an eruption of P. hermannsburgensis at the third. The lack of a population response at one site was attributed to predation, but events at the other two remain unexplained. We conclude that long-term studies should play an important role in describing temporal changes in rodent populations in arid Australia and, with field experiments, in evaluating how rainfall and other factors combine to effect the changes.

TI  - EFFECTS OF PREDATION AND COMPETITION ON SURVIVORSHIP, FECUNDITY, AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF DESERT ANNUALS'
PY  - 1980
AB  - Effects of rodent and ant granivores, watering, and thinning were studied in a diverse community of winter annuals in the Sonoran Desert. Seed predation considerably reduced plant densities, but ants and rodents had qualitatively different effects on the plant community. Ants in- creased species diversity of annuals by differentially harvesting the numerically dominant species, while rodents preyed selectively on species which dominated the community in terms of biomass. Competition among annual plants reduced growth rate, biomass, and fecundity, but had no significant effect on mortality. One species, Euphorbia polycarpa, apparently increased in density when the density of competing Erodium species was reduced by rodent predation.

TI  - A Dynamic Analysis of Age in Sugar Maple Seedlings
PY  - 1971
AB  - Age data from populations of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) seedlings in southern Wisconsin were used to investigate two plant—population models: a negative exponential model and a power function model. A weighted death probability was calculated and compared to densities of potential germinants, and the influence of seed—crop numbers on stem density was analyzed. The power function model, implying a decreasing mortality rate as the seedling ages, is a good model for describing population dynamics of sugar maple seedlings. Seed crops and potentially viable seeds appear to have no effect on the numbers of stems remaining in the population after several years. However, the density of the initial input into the population system does affect the probability of a seedling surviving during its germination year. See full-text article at JSTOR

TI  - A protocol for data exploration to avoid common statistical problems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.

TI  - Resource pulses and mammalian dynamics: conceptual models for hummock grasslands and other Australian desert habitats.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Resources are produced in pulses in many terrestrial environments, and have important effects on the population dynamics and assemblage structure of animals that consume them. Resource-pulsing is particularly dramatic in Australian desert environments owing to marked spatial and temporal variability in rainfall, and thus primary productivity. Here, we first review how Australia's desert mammals respond to fluctuations in resource production, and evaluate the merits of three currently accepted models (the ecological refuge, predator refuge and fire-mosaic models) as explanations of the observed dynamics. We then integrate elements of these models into a novel state-and-transition model and apply it to well-studied small mammal assemblages that inhabit the vast hummock grassland, or spinifex, landscapes of the continental inland. The model has four states that are defined by differences in species composition and abundance, and eight transitions or processes that prompt shifts from one state to another. Using this model as a template, we construct three further models to explain mammalian dynamics in cracking soil habitats of the Lake Eyre Basin, gibber plains of the Channel Country, and the chenopod shrublands of arid southern Australia. As non-equilibrium concepts that recognise the strongly intermittent nature of resource pulsing in arid Australia, state-and-transition models provide useful descriptors of both spatial and temporal patterns in mammal assemblages. The models should help managers to identify when and where to implement interventions to conserve native mammals, such as control burns, reduced grazing or predator management. The models also should improve understanding of the potential effects of future climate change on mammal assemblages in arid environments in general. We conclude by proposing several tests that could be used to refine the models and guide further research.

TI  - Characteristics of three spinifex alliances in Central Australia
PY  - 1990
AB  - . The three most extensive spinifex alliances in arid Australia are characterised across a spectrum of post-fire successional states by their plant species, soil chemical characteristics and rainfall. Mean annual rainfall and some nutrients are correlated with the distributions of the alliances; the Triodia pungens alliance occurs in the highest rainfall region with the highest nutrient levels, the Plectrachne schinzii alliance in the mid-rainfall region with medium nutrient levels, and the T. basedowii alliance in the lowest rainfall region with a wide range of nutrient levels. This control on distribution can be over-ridden by topographic position. Where the T. pungens alliance occurs in low rainfall areas it is on sites favoured by soil moisture concentrations higher than the surrounding areas. Non-spinifex plant species are weakly associated with these alliances and their distributions relate to mean rainfall. Soil nutrient levels are generally low and, except for carbon, do not differ significantly between alliances. Soil grain sizes do not differ between alliances.

TI  - Expectation, explanation and masting
PY  - 2004
AB  - Masting is the synchronous, episodic production of large seed crops by perennial plant populations. Generally, hypotheses concerning the evolutionary origin and maintenance of masting entail economies of scale, where the benefit of large, synchronous reproductive events accrues by overcoming some environmental constraint, such as pollen limitation or seed predation. Because all perennial plants face some degree of inter-annual environmental variability, assessing the importance of selection via economies of scale requires a clear expectation for the reproductive dynamics of plants adapted to variable environments. Using a dynamic life-history model, I demonstrate that the observed range of reproductive variability and several other aspects of masting should be expected for size-structured populations of plants utilizing optimal allocation strategies in variable environments, even in the absence of economies of scale benefits. Thus, life-history evolution in even modestly variable environments may predispose species to realize reproductive benefits via economies of scale. However, distinguishing the effects of evolved responses to environmental variability from the effects of economies of scale using current criteria is difficult, if not impossible. My results reinforce the dictum that ecologists and evolutionary biologists must carefully consider their expectations before generating and testing explanations for observed phenomena. As variations on an established evolutionary theme, economies of scale undoubtedly provide selective advantages. However, caution should be exercised when inferring that they are the major ecological and evolutionary determinant of reproductive variability of plant populations.

TI  - Climate teleconnections synchronize Picea glauca masting and fire disturbance: evidence for a fire‐related form of environmental prediction
PY  - 2019
AB  - 1.Synchronous pulses of seed masting and natural disturbance have positive feedbacks on the reproduction of masting species in disturbance‐prone ecosystems. We test the hypotheses that disturbances and proximate causes of masting are correlated, and that their large‐scale synchrony is driven by similar climate teleconnection patterns at both inter‐annual and decadal time scales. 2.Hypotheses were tested on white spruce (Picea glauca), a masting species which surprisingly persists in fire‐prone boreal forests while lacking clear fire adaptations. We built masting, drought and fire indices at regional (Alaska, Yukon, Alberta, Quebec) and subcontinental scales (western North America) spanning the second half of the 20th century. Superposed Epoch Analysis tested the temporal associations between masting events, drought and burnt area at the regional scale. At the sub‐continental scale, Superposed Epoch Analysis tested whether El Nino‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its coupled effects with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in the positive phase (AMO+/ENSO+) synchronize drought, burnt area and masting. We additionally tested the consistency of our synchronization hypotheses on a decadal temporal scale to verify whether long‐term oscillations in AMO+/ENSO + are coherent to decadal variation in drought, burnt area and masting. 3.Analyses demonstrated synchronicity between drought, fire and masting. In all regions the year before a mast event was drier and more fire‐prone than usual. During AMO+/ENSO + events sub‐continental indices of drought and burnt area experienced significant departures from mean values. The same was observed for large‐scale masting in the subsequent year, confirming 1 year lag between fire and masting. Sub‐continental indices of burnt area and masting showed in‐phase decadal fluctuations led by the AMO+/ENSO+. Results support the “Environmental prediction hypothesis” for mast seeding. 4.Synthesis. We provide evidence of large‐scale synchronicity between seed masting in Picea glauca and fire regimes in boreal forests of western North America at both inter‐annual and decadal time scales. We conclude that seed production in white spruce predicts changes in disturbance regimes by sharing the same large‐scale climate drivers with drought and fire. This gives new insides in a mechanism providing a fire‐sensitive species with higher than expected adaptability to changes in climate.

TI  - Fire, aridity and seed banks. What does seed bank composition reveal about community processes in fire-prone desert?
PY  - 2009
AB  - Questions: The relationship between fire, aridity and seed banks is poorly understood in plant community ecology. We tested whether there was a close correspondence between the seed bank and standing vegetation composition with time-since-fire in a desert. We also examined whether longer-lived species showed seed limitation relative to more ephemeral species, as this could influence grass-woody ratios in a major biome.



Location: Dune hummock grasslands/shrublands of central Australia.



Methods: The effects of time-since-fire on floristic and functional group composition were examined by comparing plots unburned since 1984 against plots that had been burned in 2002. Three methods were used to quantify seed abundances: a germination trial using heat and smoke application, a flotation method, and a sieving method.



Results: Seed bank densities were very low (<3000 m−2). Species similarity between the seed bank and standing vegetation was high at sites recently burned (0.86) and low in sites long-since burned (0.52). The relative abundance of ephemeral species in the seed bank peaked in recently burned plots, but the relative abundance of seeds of woody species did not match the pattern of abundance in the standing vegetation. Remarkably, the dominant perennial grasses and woody species were either absent from the seed bank or present at extremely low abundances.



Discussion: Differences in the relative abundance of ephemeral species between standing vegetation and seed bank relate to the post-fire succession process. The small soil pool of seed from woody species may be explained by allocation to belowground carbohydrate storage over seed production. Field observations suggest, however, that production of strongly dormant seed can be prolific and that high levels of seed predation make this system strongly seed-limited. The discovery of this seed bank syndrome indicates that shifts in grass-woody ratios can be driven by the juxtaposition of unpredictable seed rain and fire events in these desert dunes. However, estimates of grass-woody ratios due to changing fire regimes will be difficult to predict.

TI  - The Western Hare-Wallaby Lagorchestes Hirsutus (Gould) (Macropodidae), in the Tanami Desert.
PY  - 1978
AB  - Study was of 2 small colonies of the rare western hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus) in the Tanami Desert sanctuary of Northern Territories, Australia.

Cool winter fires lit deliberately along stock routes by nomadic aborigines provided firebreaks and resulted in different vegetative regeneration stages that suited the wallabies' requirements for cover and feed; the extensive hot fires started by lightning in summer destroyed habitat of the wallabies. ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT: Two small colonies of the rare western hare-wallaby (L. hirsutus) in the Tanami Desert sanctuary of Northern Territory, Australia were studied. Plants grazed were the whole plant of Fimbristylis dichotoma and Calandrinia remota, leaves of Brunonia australis, Bassia astrocarpa and F. solidifolis and seed heads of Triodia pungens, Plectrachne schinzii, Bulbostylis barbata and Eragrostis eriopoda. Cool winter fires lit deliberately along stock routes by nomadic aborigines provided firebreaks and resulted in different vegetative regeneration stages that suited the wallabies' requirements for cover and feed; the extensive hot fires started by lightning in summer destroyed the habitat of the wallabies.

TI  - Resource acquisition and reproductive strategies of tropical forest in response to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest source of interannual climate variability in much of the tropics. We hypothesize that tropical plants exhibit interannual variation in reproduction and resource acquisition strategies driven by ENSO that mirrors their seasonal responses. We analyze the relationship of leaf and seed fall to climate variation over 30 years in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Panama where El Nino brings warm, dry, and sunny conditions. Elevated leaf fall precedes the onset of El Nino, and elevated seed production follows, paralleling associations with dry seasons. Our results provide evidence of a shift in allocation from leafing to fruiting in response to a warming phase of ENSO. This shift may enable plants to take advantage of higher light availability, while coping with higher atmospheric water demand and lower water supply. These findings might be an indicator of adaptive strategies to optimize reproduction and resource acquisition. It has been suggested that tree phenology may be regulated by climatic oscillations. Here, Detto et al. present a 30 year tropical forest dataset that suggests leaf and fruit production is coordinated with ENSO cycles, with greater leaf fall observed prior to El Nino followed by greater seed production.

TI  - Climate warming disrupts mast seeding and its fitness benefits in European beech.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many plants benefit from synchronous year-to-year variation in seed production, called masting. Masting benefits plants because it increases the efficiency of pollination and satiates predators, which reduces seed loss. Here, using a 39-year-long dataset, we show that climate warming over recent decades has increased seed production of European beech but decreased the year-to-year variability of seed production and the reproductive synchrony among individuals. Consequently, the benefit that the plants gained from masting has declined. While climate warming was associated with increased reproductive effort, we demonstrate that less effective pollination and greater losses of seeds to predators offset any benefits to the plants. This shows that an apparently simple benefit of climate warming unravels because of complex ecological interactions. Our results indicate that in masting systems, the main beneficiaries of climate-driven increases in seed production are seed predators, not plants.

TI  - How do vertebrates respond to mast seeding
PY  - 2015
AB  - Mast-seeding is the synchronized and intermittent production of a large seed crop by a population of plants. The cascading effects of masting on wildlife have been well documented in granivorous rodents. Yet, the effects of mast-seeding are potentially further reaching, since a number of generalist species can take advantage of mast years. We employed a full-text search algorithm to identify all papers that discussed effects of mast-seeding on wildlife, in addition to typical searches of titles and abstracts. We aimed to evaluate the breadth of wildlife species for which mast years are thought to be important drivers. In addition, we tested three hypotheses derived from past reviews: 1) species with lower reproductive potential (lower average litter size) are more likely to show aggregative responses to mast-seeding, 2) species with lower body sizes (lower mobility) are more likely to show reproductive responses, and 3) indirect consumers of mast (predators) are more likely to show aggregative responses than direct consumers. We found 186 articles including reports of response of 122 species of vertebrates to mast-seeding. Expectations were partly confirmed: relationships 1) and 2) held for mammals, but not for birds. However, 3) direct consumers were more likely than indirect consumers to show aggregative responses. Our tests of the first two hypotheses question the generality of past predictions for taxa other than mammals. Our test of the third hypothesis suggests that responses of direct and indirect consumers might depend on the type of resource pulse. Many of the examples in our analysis come from systems in which wildlife responses to mast have been less rigorously documented than the examples in past reviews. They suggest the range of wildlife responses to mast-seeding are more taxonomically and ecologically diverse than past reviews have widely recognized and point to directions for future research.




Synthesis



Mast seeding is a pulsed resource with numerous cascading effects on wildlife. Yet, because masting is largely unpredictable, it is inherently difficult to study. We developed a full-text search algorithm to identify incidental reports as well as deliberate studies of vertebrate reactions to masting. We found that the type of response to mast seeding (reproductive or through immigration) varies predictably as a function of life history traits (litter size and body mass) in mammals, but not in birds. Our literature search also shows that responses to mast-seeding are more taxonomically and ecologically diverse than past reviews have recognized.

TI  - What defines mast seeding? Spatio‐temporal patterns of cone production by whitebark pine
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary


1. Synchronous, episodic mast seeding is common in plant populations, and is thought to increase plant fitness through economies of scale, such as satiating seed predators, attracting seed dispersers and enhancing pollination success. Although mast seeding is easy to conceptualize, it has been quantified using a number of different metrics that reflect different features of pulsed reproduction.



2. We quantified spatio-temporal patterns of mast seeding across 36 populations of a high-elevation tree, Pinus albicaulis, for which perceived declines in cone production are a conservation concern. We tested for trends in mean cone production through space and time, and documented patterns of mast seeding using six different metrics: coefficient of variation, lag-1 autocorrelation, synchrony, average cone production by individual trees, and the frequency of high cone crops on absolute and relative scales.



3. Overall, we did not detect increasing or decreasing trends in cone production during our study period. Average cone production tended to increase from north-east to south-west. Population-level cone production tended to alternate between high and low years, but overall the coefficient of variation was low for a mast seeding species.



4. Metrics of mast seeding were not concordant across populations. The first principal component describing mast metrics separated populations with frequent high cone crops from those with high coefficients of variation. However, the second principle component was at least somewhat correlated with all metrics of masting, suggesting some ability to separate ‘masting’ from ‘non-masting’ populations.



5. In P. albicaulis, spatial variation in mast seeding could reflect differences in site productivity, differences in the importance of satiating generalist seed consumers versus attracting specialist seed dispersers, or recent invasion by an introduced pathogen.



6. Synthesis. Our research reinforces the conclusion that populations form a continuum of strategies between ‘masting’ versus ‘non-masting’ extremes. However, because different features of masting do not covary in space, understanding where populations fall along this continuum will depend on the features that are most important for mast seeding in a particular context.

TI  - Oak masting drivers vary between populations depending on their climatic environments.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Large interannual variation in seed production, called masting, is very common in wind-pollinated tree populations and has profound implications for the dynamics of forest ecosystems and the epidemiology of certain human diseases.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>5</sup> Comparing the reproductive characteristics of populations established in climatically contrasting environments would provide powerful insight into masting mechanisms, but the required data are extremely scarce. We built a database from an unprecedented fine-scale 8-year survey of 150 sessile oak trees (Quercus petraea) from 15 populations distributed over a broad climatic gradient, including individual recordings of annual flowering effort, fruiting rate, and fruit production. Although oak masting was previously considered to depend mainly on fruiting rate variations,<sup>6</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>7</sup> we show that the female flowering effort is highly variable from year to year and explains most of the fruiting dynamics in two-thirds of the populations. What drives masting was found to differ among populations living under various climates. In soft-climate populations, the fruiting rate increases initially strongly with the flowering effort, and the intensity of masting results mainly from the flowering synchrony level between individuals. By contrast, the fruiting rate of harsh-climate populations depends mainly on spring weather, which ensures intense masting regardless of the flowering synchronization level. Our work highlights the need for jointly measuring flowering effort and fruit production to decipher the diversity of masting mechanisms among populations. Accounting for such diversity will be decisive in proposing accurate, and possibly contrasted, scenarios about future reproductive patterns of perennial plants with ongoing climate change and their numerous cascading effects.

TI  - Soil nutrient supply modulates temperature-induction cues in mast-seeding grasses.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Synchronous and intermittent reproduction in long-lived plants, known as mast seeding, is induced by climatic cues, but the mechanism explaining variation in masting among neighboring but edaphically segregated species is unknown. Soil nutrients can enhance flowering, and thus, populations on nutrient-rich soils may require less-favorable growing temperatures to flower. We tested this hypothesis by predicting the probability of flowering in response to air temperature for five species of alpine Chionochloa grasses in South Island, New Zealand, over 37 years and relating our predictions to soil N supply (NH4+ + NO3−). Summer air temperatures better predicted flowering than spring air temperatures, which were correlated with soil N mineralization. Species on N-rich soils required lower mean temperatures to induce flowering and/or responded more consistently across a gradient of air temperatures, contributing to the higher probability of their tillers and tussocks flowering at low summer temperatures.

TI  - Masting synchrony in northern hardwood forests: super-producers govern population fruit production
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary
Trees commonly reproduce via masting cycles, which involves synchronized inter-annual variability in fruit crop size. A few individuals in a population will commonly produce much more fruit than others. If these trees produce fruit more frequently, as indicated by a lower inter-annual variability in fruit production, they may dominate fruit production over time.
By measuring fruit production of 1635 individuals of 10 temperate tree species across 4 years in northern lower Michigan, we estimated the inter-annual variability and synchrony in each species. We compared fruit production estimates with measurements of tree size, soil nutrient availability and neighbourhood crowding to investigate the source of inter-individual variation in number of fruit produced.
We found that trees’ fruit production increased with tree size. The trees that accounted for the largest proportion of total fruit production had lower inter-annual variability and higher synchrony in fruit production. These ‘super-producer’ trees tended to have high nutrient availability and few neighbouring trees, but there were no effects of nutrient availability or neighbourhood crowding on fruit production in the population as a whole.
Synthesis. Masting is a population-level phenomenon, and is typically studied at this level. However, when we apply individual tree observations of fruit production to this phenomenon, it reveals super-producers which produce fruit more consistently than the rest of the population. By reducing inter-annual variability in fruit production, but increasing synchrony and making large numbers of fruit, super-producers may be able to reap the benefits of masting while governing population fruit production over time.

TI  - Heritability and genetic architecture of reproduction-related traits in a temperate oak species
PY  - 2018
AB  - Reproduction, one of the main components of plant fitness, is highly variable in response to environmental cues, but little is known about the genetic determinism underlying reproduction-related traits in forest tree species. There is therefore an urgent need to characterize the genetic architecture of those traits if we are to predict the evolutionary trajectories of forest populations facing rapidly changing environment and mitigate their impacts. Using a full-sib family of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), we investigated the within population variability of seed production and mean seed mass during four consecutive years. Reproductive traits were highly variable between trees and between years. The high narrow sense heritability and evolvability estimated underline the important genetic effect on the variability in seed production and mean seed mass. Despite a large variability over years, reproductive traits show significant genetic correlation between years. Furthermore, for the first time in forest tree species, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed production and mean mass of a seed have been identified. While it is commonly assumed and observed that fitness traits have low narrow sense heritabilities, our findings show that reproduction-related traits may undergo evolutionary changes under selective pressure and may be determinant for tree adaptation.

TI  - Macroevolutionary consequences of mast seeding.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Masting characterizes large, intermittent and highly synchronous seeding events among individual plants and is found throughout the plant Tree of Life (ToL). Although masting can increase plant fitness, little is known about whether it results in evolutionary changes across entire clades, such as by promoting speciation or enhanced trait selection. Here, we tested if masting has macroevolutionary consequences by combining the largest existing dataset of population-level reproductive time series and time-calibrated phylogenetic tree of vascular plants. We found that the coefficient of variation (CVp) of reproductive output for 307 species covaried with evolutionary history, and more so within clades than expected by random. Speciation rates estimated at the species level were highest at intermediate values of CVp and regional-scale synchrony (Sr) in seed production, that is, there were unimodal correlations. There was no support for monotonic correlations between either CVp or Sr and rates of speciation or seed size evolution. These results were robust to different sampling decisions, and we found little bias in our dataset compared with the wider plant ToL. While masting is often adaptive and encompasses a rich diversity of reproductive behaviours, we suggest it may have few consequences beyond the species level. This article is part of the theme issue 'The ecology and evolution of synchronized seed production in plants'.

TI  - Foodwebs based on unreliable foundations: spatiotemporal masting merged with consumer movement, storage, and diet
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Mast‐fruiting trees represent a pulsed resource that both supports and destabilizes consumer populations. Whereas a reliable resource is abundant on average and with limited variation in time and space, masting is volatile and localized, and that variability ramifies throughout food‐webs. Theory is developed to evaluate how the space–time structure of masting interacts with consumers who exploit alternative hosts, forage widely in space, and store reserves in time. We derive the space–time–species covariance in resource supply and combine it with the space–time–diet breadth of consumers, or ambit. Direct connection to data is made possible with Mast Inference and Forecasting (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">MASTIF</jats:styled-content>), a state‐space autoregressive model that fits seed‐trap and canopy observations and predicts resource availability within the canopy and on the forest floor with full uncertainty. A resource score can be assigned to each consumer–habitat combination that integrates the benefits of a high mean supply weighed against the variance cost. As the consumer ambit increases, the volatility of an unreliable resource shifts from a variance cost to a mean benefit. Consumers foraging in the canopy (arboreal arthropods and rodents, song birds) experience space‐time covariance between host trees. Consumers on the forest floor (seed and damping‐off fungi, arthropods, rodents, ground‐nesting birds, mammals) experience instead a redistribution of that covariance by dispersal. For consumers lacking mobility, demographic storage in the form of episodic birth cohorts following mast years is important for population persistence. Consumers additionally compensate volatility with diet breadth. Depending on the dominant masting strategies of host tree species in the diet, habitats differentially limit consumers depending on the misalignment between consumer ambit and spatiotemporal covariance of hosts. The impact of adding or subtracting a diet item can be gauged with the standard error (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">SE</jats:styled-content>) rule or the benefit of an added diet item balanced against the variance cost, both of which depend on the existing diet, the abundance of the new host, and the consumer's foraging ambit. Results rank habitats by their capacities to support wildlife and other consumers from a resource perspective. Results are connected directly to data, with full uncertainty, by <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">MASTIF</jats:styled-content>.</jats:p>

TI  - Flower phenology as a disruptor of the fruiting dynamics in temperate oak species.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Many perennial plants display masting, that is, fruiting with strong interannual variations, irregular and synchronized between trees within the population. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the early flower phenology in temperate oak species promotes stochasticity into their fruiting dynamics, which could play a major role in tree reproductive success. From a large field monitoring network, we compared the pollen phenology between temperate and Mediterranean oak species. Then, focusing on temperate oak species, we explored the influence of the weather around the time of budburst and flowering on seed production, and simulated with a mechanistic model the consequences that an evolutionary shifting of flower phenology would have on fruiting dynamics. Temperate oak species release pollen earlier in the season than do Mediterranean oak species. Such early flowering in temperate oak species results in pollen often being released during unfavorable weather conditions and frequently results in reproductive failure. If pollen release were delayed as a result of natural selection, fruiting dynamics would exhibit much reduced stochastic variation. We propose that early flower phenology might be adaptive by making mast-seeding years rare and unpredictable, which would greatly help in controlling the dynamics of seed consumers.

TI  - Inter-annual and decadal changes in teleconnections drive continental-scale synchronization of tree reproduction
PY  - 2017
AB  - Climate teleconnections drive highly variable and synchronous seed production (masting) over large scales. Disentangling the effect of high-frequency (inter-annual variation) from low-frequency (decadal trends) components of climate oscillations will improve our understanding of masting as an ecosystem process. Using century-long observations on masting (the MASTREE database) and data on the Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), we show that in the last 60 years both high-frequency summer and spring NAO, and low-frequency winter NAO components are highly correlated to continent-wide masting in European beech and Norway spruce. Relationships are weaker (non-stationary) in the early twentieth century. This finding improves our understanding on how climate variation affects large-scale synchronization of tree masting. Moreover, it supports the connection between proximate and ultimate causes of masting: indeed, large-scale features of atmospheric circulation coherently drive cues and resources for masting, as well as its evolutionary drivers, such as pollination efficiency, abundance of seed dispersers, and natural disturbance regimes.

TI  - Fight or flight? Potential tradeoffs between drought defense and reproduction in conifers.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Plants frequently exhibit tradeoffs between reproduction and growth when resources are limited, and often change these allocation patterns in response to stress. Shorter-lived plants such as annuals tend to allocate relatively more resources toward reproduction when stressed, while longer-lived plants tend to invest more heavily in survival and stress defense. However, severe stress may affect the fitness implications of allocating relatively more resources to reproduction versus stress defense. Increased drought intensity and duration have led to widespread mortality events in coniferous forests. In this review, we ask how potential tradeoffs between reproduction and survival influence the likelihood of drought-induced mortality and species persistence. We propose that trees may exhibit what we call 'fight or flight' behaviors under stress. 'Fight' behaviors involve greater resource allocation toward survival (e.g., growth, drought-resistant xylem and pest defense). 'Flight' consists of higher relative allocation of resources to reproduction, potentially increasing both offspring production and mortality risk for the adult. We hypothesize that flight behaviors increase as drought stress escalates the likelihood of mortality in a given location.

TI  - Investigating the relationship between climate, stand age, and temporal trends in masting behavior of European forest trees.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Masting-temporally variable seed production with high spatial synchrony-is a pervasive strategy in wind-pollinated trees that is hypothesized to be vulnerable to climate change due to its correlation with variability in abiotic conditions. Recent work suggests that aging may also have strong effects on seed production patterns of trees, but this potential confounding factor has not been considered in previous times series analysis of climate change effects. Using a 54 year dataset for seven dominant species in 17 forests across Poland, we used the proportion of seed-producing trees (PST) to contrast the predictions of the climate change and aging hypotheses in Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus petraea, and Quercus robur. Our results show that in all species, PST increased over time and that this change correlated most strongly with stand age, while the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index, a measure of drought, contributed to temporal trends in PST of F. sylvatica and Q. robur. Temporal variability of PST also increased over time in all species except P. sylvestris, while trends in temporal autocorrelation and among-stand synchrony reflect species-specific masting strategies. Our results suggest a pivotal role of plant ontogeny in driving not only the extent but also variability and synchrony of reproduction in temperate forest trees. In a time of increasing forest regrowth in Europe, we therefore call for increased attention to demographic effects such as aging on plant reproductive behavior, particularly in studies examining global change effects using long-term time series data.

TI  - Costs and benefits of masting: economies of scale are not reduced by negative density-dependence in seedling survival in Sorbus aucuparia
PY  - 2021
AB  - Masting is a widespread reproductive strategy in plants that helps to reduce seed predation and increase pollination. However, masting can involve costs, notably negative density-dependent (NDD) seedling survival caused by concentrating reproduction in intermittent events. Masting benefits have received widespread attention, but the costs are understudied, which precludes understanding why some plant species have evolved intense masting, while others reproduce regularly. We followed seed production, seed predation (both 13 years), and seedling recruitment and survival (11 years) in Sorbus aucuparia. We tested whether NDD in seedling survival after mast years can reduce the benefits of pulsed reproduction that come through predator satiation. Seed predation rates were extreme in our population (mean = 75%), but were reduced by masting. The commonly accepted, but untested, assertion that pulsed recruitment is associated with strong NDD was unsupported. Consequently, the proportion of seedlings that survived their first year increased with fruit production. This provides a rare test of economies of scale beyond the seed stage. Our results provide estimation of the costs of mast seeding, and indicate that these may be lower than expected. Low masting costs, if common, may help explain why masting is such a widespread reproductive strategy throughout the plant kingdom.

TI  - Globally, tree fecundity exceeds productivity gradients.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Lack of tree fecundity data across climatic gradients precludes the analysis of how seed supply contributes to global variation in forest regeneration and biotic interactions responsible for biodiversity. A global synthesis of raw seedproduction data shows a 250-fold increase in seed abundance from cold-dry to warm-wet climates, driven primarily by a 100-fold increase in seed production for a given tree size. The modest (threefold) increase in forest productivity across the same climate gradient cannot explain the magnitudes of these trends. The increase in seeds per tree can arise from adaptive evolution driven by intense species interactions or from the direct effects of a warm, moist climate on tree fecundity. Either way, the massive differences in seed supply ramify through food webs potentially explaining a disproportionate role for species interactions in the wet tropics.

TI  - Drivers of synchrony of acorn production in the valley oak (Quercus lobata) at two spatial scales.
PY  - 2017
AB  - We investigated spatial synchrony of acorn production by valley oaks (Quercus lobata) among individual trees at the within-population, local level and at the among-population, statewide level spanning the geographic range of the species. At the local level, the main drivers of spatial synchrony were water availability and flowering phenology of individual trees, while proximity, temperature differences between trees, and genetic similarity failed to explain a significant proportion of variance in spatial synchrony. At the statewide level, annual rainfall was the primary driver, while proximity was significant by itself but not when controlling for rainfall; genetic similarity was again not significant. These results support the hypothesis that environmental factors, the Moran effect, are key drivers of spatial synchrony in acorn production at both small and large geographic scales. The specific environmental factors differed depending on the geographic scale, but were in both cases related to water availability. In addition, flowering phenology, potentially affecting either density-independent pollination failure (the pollination Moran effect) or density-dependent pollination efficiency (pollen coupling), plays a key role in driving spatial synchrony at the local geographic scale.

TI  - Correlated seed failure as an environmental veto to synchronize reproduction of masting plants.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Variable, synchronized seed production, called masting, is a widespread reproductive strategy in plants. Resource dynamics, pollination success, and, as described here, environmental veto are possible proximate mechanisms driving masting. We explored the environmental veto hypothesis, which assumes that reproductive synchrony is driven by external factors preventing reproduction in some years, by extending the resource budget model of masting with correlated reproductive failure. We ran this model across its parameter space to explore how key parameters interact to drive seeding dynamics. Next, we parameterized the model based on 16 yr of seed production data for populations of red (Quercus rubra) and white (Quercus alba) oaks. We used these empirical models to simulate seeding dynamics, and compared simulated time series with patterns observed in the field. Simulations showed that resource dynamics and reproduction failure can produce masting even in the absence of pollen coupling. In concordance with this, in both oaks, among-year variation in resource gain and correlated reproductive failure were necessary and sufficient to reproduce masting, whereas pollen coupling, although present, was not necessary. Reproductive failure caused by environmental veto may drive large-scale synchronization without density-dependent pollen limitation. Reproduction-inhibiting weather events are prevalent in ecosystems, making described mechanisms likely to operate in many systems.

TI  - How does increasing mast seeding frequency affect population dynamics of seed consumers? Wild boar as a case study
PY  - 2020
AB  - Mast seeding in temperate oak populations shapes the dynamics of seed consumers and numerous communities. Mast seeding responds positively to warm spring temperatures and is therefore expected to increase under global warming. We investigated the potential effects of changes in oak mast seeding on wild boar population dynamics, a widespread and abundant consumer species. Using long-term monitoring data, we showed that abundant acorn production enhances the proportion of breeding females. With a body-mass-structured population model and a fixed hunting rate of 0.424, we showed that high acorn production over time would lead to an average wild boar population growth rate of 1.197 whereas non-acorn production would lead to a stable population. Finally, using climate projections and a mechanistic model linking weather data to oak reproduction, we predicted that mast seeding frequency might increase over the next century, which would lead to increase in both wild boar population size and the magnitude of its temporal variation. Our study provides rare evidence that some species could greatly benefit from global warming thanks to higher food availability and therefore highlights the importance of investigating the cascading effects of changing weather conditions on the dynamics of wild animal populations to reliably assess the effects of climate change.

TI  - Does fine scale spatiotemporal variation in seed rain translate into plant population structure?
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>In mast‐seeding species, strong annual variation in seed production is assumed to drive seed fate and ultimately plant recruitment. However, the effects of temporal variation in seed crops on spatial patterns of seed rain and recruitment are poorly understood, in part because of limited data on fine‐scale spatial variation of seed deposition. To investigate how mast‐seeding affects spatial variation in seed rain, we analysed a 15‐year data set on seed rain and population dynamics in a montane old‐growth forest (2 plots with 81 seed traps per ha), dominated by European beech <jats:italic>Fagus sylvatica</jats:italic> and, to a lesser degree, Norway spruce <jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic> and European silver fir <jats:italic>Abies alba</jats:italic>. Using geostatistical methods and point process modelling, we modeled 1) the relationship between annual seed crop and spatial heterogeneity of seed rain, 2) the temporal stability of seed rain hotspots and 3) the spatial relation of seed rain and recruitment into the population. The results illustrate the interaction between temporal and spatial variation in seed production and its consequences for population dynamics of mast‐seeding trees. The signature of annual variation in seed rain fades with seedling mortality over time in all three focal species. For beech, the cumulative probability of seed arrival over the whole study period drives spatial seedling and sapling dispersion patterns – mediated by light competition with older trees; seedling density was most strongly reduced by sapling density, while saplings were most frequently found in areas of low adult density. Such decoupling of spatial processes across life history stages, combined with spatial heterogeneity may play a larger role in driving stand‐level spatial dynamics than previously assumed.</jats:p>

TI  - MASTREE+: Time-series of plant reproductive effort from six continents.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Significant gaps remain in understanding the response of plant reproduction to environmental change. This is partly because measuring reproduction in long-lived plants requires direct observation over many years and such datasets have rarely been made publicly available. Here we introduce MASTREE+, a data set that collates reproductive time-series data from across the globe and makes these data freely available to the community. MASTREE+ includes 73,828 georeferenced observations of annual reproduction (e.g. seed and fruit counts) in perennial plant populations worldwide. These observations consist of 5971 population-level time-series from 974 species in 66 countries. The mean and median time-series length is 12.4 and 10 years respectively, and the data set includes 1122 series that extend over at least two decades (≥20 years of observations). For a subset of well-studied species, MASTREE+ includes extensive replication of time-series across geographical and climatic gradients. Here we describe the open-access data set, available as a.csv file, and we introduce an associated web-based app for data exploration. MASTREE+ will provide the basis for improved understanding of the response of long-lived plant reproduction to environmental change. Additionally, MASTREE+ will enable investigation of the ecology and evolution of reproductive strategies in perennial plants, and the role of plant reproduction as a driver of ecosystem dynamics.

TI  - North American tree migration paced by climate in the West, lagging in the East.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Tree fecundity and recruitment have not yet been quantified at scales needed to anticipate biogeographic shifts in response to climate change. By separating their responses, this study shows coherence across species and communities, offering the strongest support to date that migration is in progress with regional limitations on rates. The southeastern continent emerges as a fecundity hotspot, but it is situated south of population centers where high seed production could contribute to poleward population spread. By contrast, seedling success is highest in the West and North, serving to partially offset limited seed production near poleward frontiers. The evidence of fecundity and recruitment control on tree migration can inform conservation planning for the expected long-term disequilibrium between climate and forest distribution.

TI  - Climate Change Strengthens Selection for Mast Seeding in European Beech
PY  - 2020
AB  - Climate change is altering patterns of seed production worldwide [1-4], but the potential for evolutionary responses to these changes is poorly understood. Masting (synchronous, annually variable seed production by plant populations) is selectively beneficial through economies of scale that decrease the cost of reproduction per surviving offspring [5-7]. Masting is particularly widespread in temperate trees [8, 9] impacting food webs, macronutrient cycling, carbon storage, and human disease risk [10-12], so understanding its response to climate change is important. Here, we analyze inter-individual variability in plant reproductive patterns and two economies of scale-predator satiation and pollination efficiency-and document how natural selection acting upon them favors masting. Four decades of observations for European beech (Fagus sylvatica) show that predator satiation and pollination efficiency select for individuals with higher inter-annual variability of reproduction and higher reproductive synchrony between individuals. This result confirms the long-standing theory that masting, a population-level phenomenon, is generated by selection on individuals. Furthermore, recent climate-driven increases in mean seed production have increased selection pressure from seed predators but not from pollination efficiency. Natural selection is thus acting to restore the fitness benefits of masting, which have previously decreased under a warming climate [13]. However, selection will likely take far longer (centuries) than climate warming (decades), so in the short-term, tree reproduction will be reduced because masting has become less effective at satiating seed predators. Over the long-term, evolutionary responses to climate change could potentially increase inter-annual variability of seed production of masting species.

TI  - Nutrient scarcity as a selective pressure for mast seeding.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Mast seeding is one of the most intriguing reproductive traits in nature. Despite its potential drawbacks in terms of fitness, the widespread existence of this phenomenon suggests that it should have evolutionary advantages under certain circumstances. Using a global dataset of seed production time series for 219 plant species from all of the continents, we tested whether masting behaviour appears predominantly in species with low foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations when controlling for local climate and productivity. Here, we show that masting intensity is higher in species with low foliar N and P concentrations, and especially in those with imbalanced N/P ratios, and that the evolutionary history of masting behaviour has been linked to that of nutrient economy. Our results support the hypothesis that masting is stronger in species growing under limiting conditions and suggest that this reproductive behaviour might have evolved as an adaptation to nutrient limitations and imbalances.

TI  - Effects of pulsed resources on the dynamics of seed consumer populations: a comparative demographic study in wild boar
PY  - 2021
AB  - Mast seeding is a well‐known example of pulsed resources in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the large literature available so far on the effects of mast seeding on the dynamics of seed consumer populations, it remains unknown whether heterogeneity in demographic responses to mast seeding exists both within a population of consumers and among consumer populations. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by assessing the effects of acorn production (i.e., oak mast) on all stage‐specific demographic rates (i.e., survival, growth, reproduction) in several consumer populations. From long‐term capture–mark–recapture data collected in three wild boar populations in Europe and detailed information on annual acorn production, we quantified the effects of acorn production on body mass‐specific demographic rates in these populations. We then built a body mass‐structured population model for each population and assessed the effect of acorn production on generation time—the mean age of mother at childbirth—and population growth rate using a combination of prospective and retrospective demographic analyses. Within populations, acorn production had a positive effect on reproduction (proportion of breeding females) and growth of small‐sized females. Survival remained buffered against environmental variation, in accordance with the demographic buffering hypothesis. Thus, all stage‐specific demographic rates were not influenced in the same way by acorn production. In turn, higher reproduction and growth probabilities involved higher population growth rates and shorter generation times. Despite these common demographic responses to mast seeding among populations, we highlighted marked among‐population variation in the magnitude of these responses. Also, while populations inhabiting resource‐rich environments took advantage of current acorn conditions, populations under resource‐poor environments stored and allocated acorns produced the preceding year to reproduction indicating contrasting breeding tactics along the capital–income continuum. Our results suggest heterogeneity in demographic responses to mast seeding, within and among populations. This is an important finding for our understanding of the effects of mast seeding on the dynamics of seed consumer populations.

TI  - Amplified Cyclicality in Mast Seeding Dynamics Positively Influences the Dynamics of a Seed Consumer Species.
PY  - 2022
AB  - AbstractTemporal autocorrelation in environmental conditions influences population dynamics through its effects on vital rates. However, a comprehensive understanding of how and to what extent temporal autocorrelation shapes population dynamics is still lacking because most empirical studies have unrealistically assumed that environmental conditions are temporally independent. Mast seeding is a biological event characterized by highly fluctuating and synchronized seed production at the tree population scale as well as a marked negative temporal autocorrelation. In the current context of global change, mast seeding events are expected to become more frequent, leading to strengthened negative temporal autocorrelations and thereby amplified cyclicality in mast seeding dynamics. Theory predicts that population growth rates are maximized when the environmental cyclicality of consumer resources and their generation times are closely matched. To test this prediction, we took advantage of the long-term monitoring of a wild boar population, a widespread seed consumer species characterized by a short generation time (∼2 years). As expected, simulations indicated that its stochastic population growth rate increased as mast seeding dynamics became more negatively autocorrelated. Our findings demonstrate that accounting for temporal autocorrelations in environmental conditions relative to the generation time of the focal population is required, especially under conditions of global warming, where the cyclicality in resource dynamics is likely to change.

TI  - Biogeography and phylogeny of masting: do global patterns fit functional hypotheses?
PY  - 2020
AB  - Interannual variability of seed crops (CVp) has profound consequences for plant populations and food webs, where high CVp is termed 'masting'. Here we ask: is global variation in CVp better predicted by plant or habitat differences consistent with adaptive economies of scale, in which flower and seed benefits increase disproportionately during mast years; or by passive mechanisms, in which seed production responds to variation in resource availability associated with climate variability? To address this question, we compiled a dataset for phylogenetic comparative analysis of long-term fruit/seed production for plants comprising 920 time series spanning 311 plant species. Factors associated with both adaptive benefits of CVp (wind pollination and seed dispersal) and climatic variability (variability of summer precipitation) were among the best predictors of global variation in CVp. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between CVp and latitude and intermediate phylogenetic and geographic signals in CVp. CVp is patterned nonrandomly across the globe and over the plant tree of life, where high CVp is associated with species benefiting from economies of scale of seed or flower production and with species that experience variable rainfall over summer months when seeds usually mature.

TI  - Masting by beech trees predicts the risk of Lyme disease
PY  - 2021
AB  - The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Over a 15-year period (2004–2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2 years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2 years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis.

TI  - Continent-wide tree fecundity driven by indirect climate effects.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Indirect climate effects on tree fecundity that come through variation in size and growth (climate-condition interactions) are not currently part of models used to predict future forests. Trends in species abundances predicted from meta-analyses and species distribution models will be misleading if they depend on the conditions of individuals. Here we find from a synthesis of tree species in North America that climate-condition interactions dominate responses through two pathways, i) effects of growth that depend on climate, and ii) effects of climate that depend on tree size. Because tree fecundity first increases and then declines with size, climate change that stimulates growth promotes a shift of small trees to more fecund sizes, but the opposite can be true for large sizes. Change the depresses growth also affects fecundity. We find a biogeographic divide, with these interactions reducing fecundity in the West and increasing it in the East. Continental-scale responses of these forests are thus driven largely by indirect effects, recommending management for climate change that considers multiple demographic rates.

TI  - Seed predation selects for reproductive variability and synchrony in perennial plants

AB  - Annually variable and synchronous seed production by plant populations, or masting, is a widespread reproductive strategy in long-lived plants. Masting is thought to be selectively beneficial because interannual variability and synchrony increase the fitness of plants through economies of scale that decrease the cost of reproduction per surviving offspring. Predator satiation is believed to be a key economy of scale, but whether it can drive phenotypic evolution for masting in plants has been rarely explored. We used data from seven plant species (Quercus humilis, Quercus ilex, Quercus rubra, Quercus alba, Quercus montana, Sorbus aucuparia and Pinus pinea) to determine whether predispersal seed predation selects for plant phenotypes that mast. Predation selected for interannual variability in Mediterranean oaks (Q. humilis and Q. ilex), for synchrony in Q. rubra, and for both interannual variability and reproductive synchrony in S. aucuparia and P. pinea. Predation never selected for negative temporal autocorrelation of seed production. Predation by invertebrates appears to select for only some aspects of masting, most importantly high coefficient of variation, supporting individual-level benefits of the population-level phenomenon of mast seeding. Determining the selective benefits of masting is complex because of interactions with other seed predators, which may impose contradictory selective pressures.

TI  - Does masting scale with plant size? High reproductive variability and low synchrony in small and unproductive individuals.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background and Aims: In a range of plant species, the distribution of individual mean fecundity is skewed and dominated by a few highly fecund individuals. Larger plants produce greater seed crops, but the exact nature of the relationship between size and reproductive patterns is poorly understood. This is especially clear in plants that reproduce by exhibiting synchronized quasi-periodic variation in fruit production, a process called masting. Methods: We investigated covariation of plant size and fecundity with individual-plant-level masting patterns and seed predation in 12 mast-seeding species: Pinus pinea, Astragalus scaphoides, Sorbus aucuparia, Quercus ilex, Q. humilis, Q. rubra, Q. alba, Q. montana, Chionochloa pallens, C. macra, Celmisia lyallii and Phormium tenax. Key Results: Fecundity was non-linearly related to masting patterns. Small and unproductive plants frequently failed to produce any seeds, which elevated their annual variation and decreased synchrony. Above a low fecundity threshold, plants had similar variability and synchrony, regardless of their size and productivity. Conclusions: Our study shows that within-species variation in masting patterns is correlated with variation in fecundity, which in turn is related to plant size. Low synchrony of low-fertility plants shows that the failure years were idiosyncratic to each small plant, which in turn implies that the small plants fail to reproduce because of plant-specific factors (e.g. internal resource limits). Thus, the behaviour of these sub-producers is apparently the result of trade-offs in resource allocation and environmental limits with which the small plants cannot cope. Plant size and especially fecundity and propensity for mast failure years play a major role in determining the variability and synchrony of reproduction in plants.

TI  - Measuring temporal patterns in ecology: The case of mast seeding.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Properly assessing temporal patterns is a central issue in ecology in order to understand ecosystem processes and their mechanisms. Mast seeding has traditionally been described as a reproductive behavior consisting of highly variable and synchronized reproductive events. The most common metric used to measure temporal variability and thus infer masting behavior, the coefficient of variation (CV), however, has been repeatedly suggested to improperly estimate temporal variability. Biases of CV estimates are especially problematic for non-normally distributed data and/or data sets with a high number of zeros.Some recent studies have already adopted new metrics to measure temporal variability, but most continue to use CV. This controversy has started a strong debate about what metrics to use.We here summarize the problems of CV when assessing temporal variability, particularly across data sets containing a large number of zeros, and highlight the benefits of using other metrics of temporal variability, such as proportional variability (PV) and consecutive disparity (D). We also suggest a new way to look at reproductive behavior, by separating temporal variability from frequency of reproduction, to allow better comparison of data sets with different characteristics.We suggest future studies to properly describe the temporal patterns in fully scientific and measurable terms that do not lead to confusion, such as variability and frequency of reproduction, using robust and fully comparable metrics.

TI  - Dissecting components of population‐level variation in seed production and the evolution of masting behavior
PY  - 2003
AB  - Koenig, W. D., Kelly, D., Sork, V. L., Duncan, R. P., Elkinton, J. S., Peltonen, M. S. and Westfall, R. D. 2003. Dissecting components of population-level variation in seed production and the evolution of masting behavior. – Oikos 102: 581–591. Mast-fruiting or masting behavior is the cumulative result of the reproductive patterns of individuals within a population and thus involves components of individual variability, between-individual synchrony, and endogenous cycles of temporal autocorrelation. Extending prior work by Herrera, we explore the interrelationships of these components using data on individual seed production in 59 populations of plants from 24 species spanning a large range of annual variability, from species exhibiting strong masting to others with little annual variability in seed production. Estimates of population and individual variability were not biased by sample size or average overall seed production when based on untransformed seed production values, but these values declined as log-transformed seed production increased. Population variability was more strongly correlated with individual variability (r= 0.86) than individual synchrony (r=0.73). These latter two components were also significantly correlated (r=0.45), but randomizations confirm that they need not covary closely. Thus, selection can act separately on inter-annual variability and between-individual synchrony. We illustrate the potential for such fine-tuned selection on seed production patterns by discussing several examples and by demonstrating significant differences in components of population-level variation in seed production among species related to their life-history.

TI  - Niche Shifts From Trees to Fecundity to Recruitment That Determine Species Response to Climate Change
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Anticipating the next generation of forests requires understanding of recruitment responses to habitat change. Tree distribution and abundance depend not only on climate, but also on habitat variables, such as soils and drainage, and on competition beneath a shaded canopy. Recent analyses show that North American tree species are migrating in response to climate change, which is exposing each population to novel climate-habitat interactions (CHI). Because CHI have not been estimated for either adult trees or regeneration (recruits per year per adult basal area), we cannot evaluate migration potential into the future. Using the Masting Inference and Forecasting (MASTIF) network of tree fecundity and new continent-wide observations of tree recruitment, we quantify impacts for redistribution across life stages from adults to fecundity to recruitment. We jointly modeled response of adult abundance and recruitment rate to climate/habitat conditions, combined with fecundity sensitivity, to evaluate if shifting CHI explain community reorganization. To compare climate effects with tree fecundity, which is estimated from trees and thus is "conditional" on tree presence, we demonstrate how to quantify this conditional status for regeneration. We found that fecundity was regulated by temperature to a greater degree than other stages, yet exhibited limited responses to moisture deficit. Recruitment rate expressed strong sensitivities to CHI, more like adults than fecundity, but still with substantial differences. Communities reorganized from adults to fecundity, but there was a re-coalescence of groups as seedling recruitment partially reverted to community structure similar to that of adults. Results provide the first estimates of continent-wide community sensitivity and their implications for reorganization across three life-history stages under climate change.</jats:p>

TI  - Individual-level variation in reproductive effort in chestnut oak (Quercus montana Willd.) and black oak (Q. Velutina Lam.)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Masting is a population-level reproductive strategy, where individuals synchronize large but intermittent seed production. Despite the high degree of synchrony at the population level, there can be considerable variation in reproduction among individuals (intraspecific variation). Here, we use 18 years of acorn production data from individual chestnut oak and black oak from control and thinned stands, to understand what factors influence individual differences in reproductive effort and variability. We included a variety of tree-level measurements, environmental characteristics, and measurements from tree cores to determine if certain characteristics were associated variations in reproduction. We considered both mean annual acorn production per m2 crown and interannual variation in acorn production (CV) as response variables. We also classified individuals as super producers (i.e., those that consistently produce more acorns than others), good, fair and poor producers (i.e., those that consistently produce less or have a higher number of failure years). In chestnut oak, 14% of the individuals were classified as super producers and contributed 34% of the total acorns, while poor producers made up 35% of the trees and contributed only 16% to total acorn production. In black oak, super producers (14% of the individuals) contributed 31% of total acorns and poor producers (24% of the individuals) contributed only 9% of the acorns. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was the most consistent variable for explaining intraspecific variation in reproductive effort and variability (i.e., larger individuals had higher mean acorn production for both chestnut oak and black oak, and lower CV for black oak). Other variables that influenced reproduction and variation included elevation and clay content for chestnut oak, and slope for black oak. We found no significant effect from the thinning treatment on acorn production. Our results illustrate how tree-level and environmental characteristics can distinguish acorn production groups, which can be used to inform management and selective harvesting decisions.

TI  - WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM RESOURCE PULSES
PY  - 2008
AB  - An increasing number of studies in a wide range of natural systems have investigated how pulses of resource availability influence ecological processes at individual, population, and community levels. Taken together, these studies suggest that some common processes may underlie pulsed resource dynamics in a wide diversity of systems. Developing a common framework of terms and concepts for the study of resource pulses may facilitate greater synthesis among these apparently disparate systems. Here, we propose a general definition of the resource pulse concept, outline some common patterns in the causes and consequences of resource pulses, and suggest a few key questions for future investigations. We define resource pulses as episodes of increased resource availability in space and time that combine low frequency (rarity), large magnitude (intensity), and short duration (brevity), and emphasize the importance of considering resource pulses at spatial and temporal scales relevant to specific resource-consumer interactions. Although resource pulses are uncommon events for consumers in specific systems, our review of the existing literature suggests that pulsed resource dynamics are actually widespread phenomena in nature. Resource pulses often result from climatic and environmental factors, processes of spatiotemporal accumulation and release, outbreak population dynamics, or a combination of these factors. These events can affect life history traits and behavior at the level of individual consumers, numerical responses at the population level, and indirect effects at the community level. Consumers show strategies for utilizing ephemeral resources opportunistically, reducing resource variability by averaging over larger spatial scales, and tolerating extended interpulse periods of reduced resource availability. Resource pulses can also create persistent effects in communities through several mechanisms. We suggest that the study of resource pulses provides opportunities to understand the dynamics of many specific systems, and may also contribute to broader ecological questions at individual, population, and community levels.

TI  - Individual resource limitation combined with population‐wide pollen availability drives masting in the valley oak (Quercus lobata)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary
Masting, the synchronized production of variable seed crops, is widespread among woody plants, but there is no consensus about the underlying proximate mechanisms. To understand this population-level behaviour, it is necessary to dissect the behaviour of individual trees as well as the interactions that synchronize them.
Here, we test a model of masting in which variability in seed set is driven by resource limitation within trees and synchrony is driven by pollen limitation due to phenological asynchrony in some years.
We used a 35-year seed set data set and a 12-year phenological data set to analyse seed production of 84 valley oaks (Quercus lobata) in central coastal California. Individual trees varied tremendously in their seed production patterns; trees with high levels of seed production were less variable over time, but showed stronger negative autocorrelation between years, suggesting that they are more resource-limited than unproductive trees. In years of more asynchronous flowering, Q. lobata produced fewer seeds, consistent with the importance of phenological synchrony.
We parametrized a model with these results to investigate how individual resource limitation and population-wide pollen limitation – a consequence of asynchronous flowering during cold spring temperatures – interact to shape annual variation in seed production. The model illustrates that this proximate abiotic driver can synchronize the behaviour of individuals, resulting in population-wide seed production patterns that closely resemble the field data.
Synthesis. Our findings support the hypothesis that an interaction between two proximate mechanisms, individual resource limitation and environmental variation affecting population-wide pollen availability, drives masting in this population of Quercus lobata. This combination of internal and external proximate drivers may underlie masting behaviour in many wind-pollinated plants.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Decadal changes in masting behaviour—directional changes in seed production with fluctuations on a decadal time‐scale—are attracting widespread attention in the context of global climate change.

The moving average of seed production in a 20‐year sliding window increased, whereas the coefficient of variation decreased.

By conducting the statistical analyses of a long‐term seed production dataset, we obtained significant evidence of decadal changes in the masting behaviour of the Japanese oak and showed that the shortening of the masting interval was associated with rising temperature.

TI  - Aridity drives spatiotemporal patterns of masting across the latitudinal range of a dryland conifer
PY  - 2019
AB  - Masting, or the synchronous and irregular production of seed crops, is controlled by environmental conditions and resource budgets. Increasing temperatures and shifting precipitation regimes may alter the frequency and magnitude of masting, especially in species that experience chronic resource stress. Yet the effects of a changing climate on seed production are unlikely to be uniform across populations, particularly those that span broad abiotic gradients. In this study, we assessed the spatiotemporal patterns of masting across the latitudinal distribution of a widely distributed dryland conifer species, pinon pine Pinus edulis. We quantified seed cone production from 2004 to 2017 using cone abscission scars in 187 trees from 28 sites along an 1100 km latitudinal gradient to investigate the spatiotemporal drivers of seed cone production and synchrony across populations. Populations from chronically hot and dry areas (greater climatic water deficits and less monsoonal precipitation) tended to have greater interannual variability in seed cone production and smaller crop sizes. Mast years generally followed years with low vapor pressure deficits and high precipitation during key periods of the reproductive process, but the strength of these relationships varied across the region. Populations that received greater monsoonal precipitation were less sensitive to late summer vapor pressure deficits during seed cone initiation yet more sensitive to spring vapor pressure deficits during pollination. Spatially correlated patterns of vapor pressure deficit better predicted synchrony in seed cone production than geographic distance, and these patterns were conserved at distances up to 500 km. These results demonstrate that aridity drives spatiotemporal variability in seed cone production. As a result, projected increases in aridity are likely to decrease the frequency and magnitude of masting in these dry forests and woodlands. Declines in seed production may compound climatic limitations to recruitment and impede tree regeneration, with cascading effects for numerous wildlife species.

TI  - Generalized joint attribute modeling for biodiversity analysis: median-zero, multivariate, multifarious data
PY  - 2017
AB  - Probabilistic forecasts of species distribution and abundance require models that accommodate the range of ecological data, including a joint distribution of multiple species based on combinations of continuous and discrete observations, mostly zeros. We develop a generalized joint attribute model (GJAM), a probabilistic framework that readily applies to data that are combinations of presence-absence, ordinal, continuous, discrete, composition, zero-inflated, and censored. It does so as a joint distribution over all species providing inference on sensitivity to input variables, correlations between species on the data scale, prediction, sensitivity analysis, definition of community structure, and missing data imputation. GJAM applications illustrate flexibility to the range of species-abundance data. Applications to forest inventories demonstrate species relationships responding as a community to environmental variables. It shows that the environment can be inverse predicted from the joint distribution of species. Application to microbiome data demonstrates how inverse prediction in the GJAM framework accelerates variable selection, by isolating effects of each input variable's influence across all species.

TI  - Quantitative methods for defining mast‐seeding years across species and studies
PY  - 2009
AB  - : Although there is a quantitative method that is commonly used for identifying mast-seeding behaviour of a plant population based on the coefficient of variation (i.e. CV is standard deviation/mean>1), there is no general quantitative method for delineating “mast” as opposed to “non-mast” years. Mast years are, however, described qualitatively as years when “large”, “unusually large” and “high” seed production occurs. The use of a consistent and generally applicable method for delineating mast years across species and plant populations is important for synthesizing knowledge of the causes and consequences of mast seeding, which could be confounded by using different methods among studies. We examine six quantitative methods for identifying mast years: four methods from the literature and two methods developed here. We use 36 seed production datasets covering a variety of species with ≥10 years of data to test the performance of these six methods. For each method, we quantify the percentage of the datasets to which the method could be successfully applied, the magnitude of the mast year relative to the mean, the frequency of mast years and the occurrence of consecutive mast years. The majority of the methods failed to meet the criteria for a suitable method. The best method used the number of standard deviates (standardized deviate method) of the annual mean seed production from the long-term mean of the dataset to identify mast-seeding years. General results from the standardized deviate method include that the occurrence of mast-seeding years is largely unrelated to plant population CV, but similar across species and data collection methods.

TI  - Global patterns in the predator satiation effect of masting: A meta-analysis.
PY  - 2022
AB  - SignificanceMasting, or synchronous production of large seed crops, is widespread among plants. The predator satiation hypothesis states that masting evolved to overwhelm seed predators with an excess of food. Yet, this popular explanation faced few rigorous tests. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that related the magnitude of seed production to the intensity of seed predation. Our results validate certain theoretical notions (e.g., that predator satiation is more effective at higher latitudes) but challenge others (e.g., that specialist and generalist consumers differ in the type of functional response to masting). We also found that masting is losing its ability to satiate consumers, probably because global warming affected masting patterns. This shift might considerably impair the reproduction of masting plants.

TI  - Resource allocation trade-offs in a mast-seeding conifer: piñon pine prioritizes reproduction over defence
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>The cost of plant reproduction or defense at the expense of other fitness traits is a central component of life history theory. Yet the three central resource allocation pathways of growth, reproduction, and defense have rarely been assessed simultaneously nor across individual to landscape scales. This information is critical towards identifying the physiological, environmental, and genetic mechanisms underpinning resource allocation. This study assessed trade-offs in resource allocation between tree growth, defense, and reproduction across scales among piñon pine (Pinusedulis), a widespread mast-seeding conifer of the southwestern USA. Time series (2004-2016) of tree growth (radial and primary shoot growth), defense (resin duct production; a key constitutive defense for this species), and cone production among individual trees from populations across a broad environmental gradient were used to investigate these trade-offs in resource allocation across three scales: individual, population, and landscape. We found evidence for a defense-reproduction trade-off among individuals whereby total resin duct area in annual xylem rings was lower during years of above average cone production. Despite variability in cone and resin duct production across trees within a population and across populations, there was no association between these fitness traits at either of those scales. There was no evidence of trade-offs between cone production and growth at any scales measured, whereas resin duct production and growth were positively related at all scales. Our study suggests that a strategic trade-off occurs whereby investment into defense is temporarily curtailed to favor reproduction, despite increased risk of exposure to natural enemies and the ability of piñon pine to simultaneously allocate carbon to growth and defense. Our study provides new insights into physiological expressions of growth, defense, and reproduction over time in this long-lived masting conifer and indicates the presence of trade-offs with direct importance for individual fitness and population dynamics under global change.</jats:p>

TI  - Forecasting seed production in perennial plants: identifying challenges and charting a path forward.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Interannual variability of seed production, known as masting, has far-reaching ecological impacts including effects on forest regeneration and the population dynamics of seed consumers. Because the relative timing of management and conservation efforts in ecosystems dominated by masting species often determines their success, there is a need to study masting mechanisms and develop forecasting tools for seed production. Here, we aim to establish seed production forecasting as a new branch of the discipline. We evaluate the predictive capabilities of three models - foreMast, ΔT, and a sequential model - designed to predict seed production in trees using a pan-European dataset of Fagus sylvatica seed production. The models are moderately successful in recreating seed production dynamics. The availability of high-quality data on prior seed production improved the sequential model's predictive power, suggesting that effective seed production monitoring methods are crucial for creating forecasting tools. In terms of extreme events, the models are better at predicting crop failures than bumper crops, likely because the factors preventing seed production are better understood than the processes leading to large reproductive events. We summarize the current challenges and provide a roadmap to help advance the discipline and encourage the further development of mast forecasting.

TI  - THE EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF TOLERANCE TO CONSUMER DAMAGE
PY  - 2000
AB  - ▪ Abstract Recent theoretical studies suggest that the ability to tolerate consumer damage can be an important adaptive response by plants to selection imposed by consumers. Empirical studies have also found that tolerance is a common response to consumers among plants. Currently recognized mechanisms underlying tolerance include several general sets of traits: allocation patterns; plant architecture; and various other traits that may respond to consumer damage, e.g., photosynthetic rate. Theoretical studies suggest that tolerance to consumer damage may be favored under a range of conditions, even when the risk and intensity of damage varies. However, most of these models assume that the evolution of tolerance is constrained by internal resource allocation trade-offs. While there is some empirical evidence for such trade-offs, it is also clear that external constraints such as pollinator abundance or nutrient availability may also limit the evolution of tolerance. Current research also suggests that a ful...

TI  - ADAPTATION OF GRAY SQUIRREL BEHAVIOR TO AUTUMN GERMINATION BY WHITE OAK ACORNS.
PY  - 1982
AB  - The oaks (Quercus L.) are divided into two subgenera, the white oaks (Leucobalanus Engelmann) and the red oaks (Erythrobalanus Spach). Like most midlatitude plants, red oaks have dormant seeds which germinate in spring after being dispersed in autumn. Acorns of many species of white oaks germinate in autumn soon after they fall, producing a large taproot which stores much of the acorn's food reserves over winter. Live (evergreen) oaks are taxonomically regarded as red oaks (Williams, 1939), but resemble white oaks in many important seed and life history traits, including early germination (Sargent, 1905; Lewis, 1911; Trelease, 1924; USDA, 1974). Red oaks and white or live oaks typically occur together as associates and potential competitors throughout North America. They will be referred to collectively as WO and RO; WO by implication includes live oaks insofar as their seed biology is convergent with white oaks. Unabbreviated common names refer to single species for which the scientific name is given at least once. The seedling taproot of white oak (Q. alba L.), probably the most common WO of eastern North America, grows rapidly in autumn and perhaps also grows more slowly through the winter, drawing upon the food reserves of the cotyledons. The seedling taproot is remarkably thickened on seedlings of Q. alba and Q. virginiana Mill. (Fig. 1A; Lewis, 1911) and appears to serve as an overwinter storage organ. A white oak acorn in a sense buries itself, and the rapid germination and root engorgement may serve as an escape from various seed predators (D. H. Janzen, pers. comm.). This paper reinterprets autumn germination in the WO as a post-dispersal escape from tree squirrels, although the trait may have other adaptive values as well. It also reports that gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis Gmelin) kill acorns of WO before caching them, by cutting out (excising) the seed 'embryo' (Fig. 1B, C). The adaptive value suggested for this behavior is preventing 'escape' and loss of that fraction of the acorn which is transferred into the seedling taproot between the time an acorn is cached in autumn and the time when a squirrel returns to utilize the acorn in winter. A brief description of oak seed and seedling morphology will be helpful (see also USDA, 1974 p. 698). The mature acorn, technically a fruit but here called a seed, consists of a pericarp (shell) enclosing two seedling leaves (cotyledons) which are filled with food reserves and occupy most of the seed. The cotyledons are connected by petioles to the tiny seedling (hereafter improperly but less ambiguously called the embryo when referring to ungerminated acorns). The embryo is located very near the apex or pointed end of the acorn and is folded between the cotyledons. In germination the pericarp splits at the apex and the radicle (seedling root) emerges first. Later, the entire seedling is thrust out, as the cotyledonary petioles arch out and downwards and lengthen to 2-5 cm. The radicle grows into a stout taproot in autumn, but the epicotyl and hypocotyl (the presumptive leaves and stem) grow scarcely at all until spring.

TI  - Caching and feeding decisions by Sciurus carolinensis : Responses to weevil-infested acorns
PY  - 1996
AB  - We tested the caching and feeding responses of gray squirrels ( Sciurus carolinensis ) to acorns of three species of oaks ( Quercus alba, Q. palustris , and Q. rubra ) infested with weevil larvae ( Curculio ). Experiments were designed to test the primary hypothesis that squirrels selectively cache sound acorns and the secondary hypothesis that such response may be due to increased perishability resulting from infestation. In an open, suburban oak ( Quercus ) forest in northeastern Pennsylvania, we presented free-ranging animals with whole, infested acorns, whole, noninfested acorns, and noninfested acorns from which the pericarp (shell) was removed to increase perishability. Squirrels cached significantly (20–35%) more of whole, intact acorns of red oak, dispersed these acorns significantly greater distances before caching them, and consumed shelled and infested acorns. Squirrels showed a similar response to acorns of pin oak, but ate significantly more of both infested and noninfested acorns of white oak. Squirrels also were observed to consume weevil larvae in >76% of all trials with infested acorns. These results indicate that squirrels can distinguish between infested and noninfested acorns, that they often selectively cache sound acorns, and that weevils represent a significant dietary supplement for squirrels. We also suggest that gray squirrels may exert a strong influence on the dispersal of oaks by selecting viable seeds for storage.

TI  - VARIATION IN THE DEFENSE STRATEGIES OF PLANTS: ARE RESISTANCE AND TOLERANCE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE?
PY  - 1997
AB  - Plants can employ two general strategies to defend themselves against herbivory: they can either reduce the amount of damage they experience (resistance), or they can tolerate herbivore damage. Theoretical considerations suggest that, in many cases, tolerance and resistance are redundant strategies, and may therefore be mutually exclusive adaptations. In this investigation of natural populations of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana we examine whether the pattern of selection acting on resistance and tolerance favors the evolution of one defense strategy, or the other, but not both. We found that the joint pattern of selection acting on tolerance and two resistance traits, trichome density and total glucosinolate concentration, indicated that there were not alternate peaks in the fitness landscape favoring either resistance or tolerance. Rather, selection favored the retention of both tolerance and resistance. One reason for the absence of mutually exclusive alternative resistance/tolerance strategies is the absence of a negative genetic correlation between resistance and tolerance. An unexpected result is the detection of disruptive selection acting on tolerance, which seems to result from a nonlinear relationship between tolerance and its costs.

TI  - DO SMALL-SEEDED SPECIES HAVE HIGHER SURVIVAL THROUGH SEED PREDATION THAN LARGE-SEEDED SPECIES?
PY  - 2003
AB  - Seed ecologists have often stated that they expect larger-seeded species to have lower survivorship through postdispersal seed predation than smaller-seeded species. Similar predictions can be made for the relationship between survivorship through predis- persal seed predation and seed mass. In order to test these predictions, we gathered data regarding survivorship through 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed predators for 81 Australian species, and survivorship through predispersal seed predation for 170 Aus- tralian species. These species came from an arid environment, a subalpine environment, and a temperate coastal environment. We also gathered data from the published literature (global) on survivorship through postdispersal seed predation for 280 species and survi- vorship through predispersal seed predation for 174 species. We found a weak positive correlation between seed mass and the percentage of seeds remaining after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed predators at two of three field sites in Australia, and no significant relationship across 280 species from the global lit- erature, or at the remaining field site. There was no significant relationship between seed mass and survivorship through predispersal seed predation either cross-species or across phylogenetic divergences in any of the vegetation types, or in the compilation of data from the literature. Postdispersal seed removal was responsible for a greater percentage of seed loss in our field studies than was predispersal seed predation. On average, 83% of diaspores remained after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed removers, whereas 87% of seeds survived all predispersal seed predation that occurred between seed formation and seed maturity. Mean seed survival was higher in the field studies than in the literature compi- lations, and species showing 100% survival were heavily underrepresented in the literature. These differences may be due to biases in species selection or publication bias. Seed defensive tissue mass increased isometrically with seed mass, but there was no significant relationship between the amount of defensive tissue per gram of seed reserve mass and survivorship through postdispersal seed predation.

TI  - A meta-analysis of tradeoffs between plant tolerance and resistance to herbivores: combining the evidence from ecological and agricultural studies
PY  - 2006
AB  - Resistance and tolerance represent two general strategies of plant defence against herbivores. Since resources available for allocation to defence are limited and resistance and tolerance are likely to serve the same functions for plants, the occurrence of trade offs between these two strategies has been assumed. We review the empirical evidence for tolerance-resistance tradeoffs by means of meta-analysis of genetic correlations between resistance and tolerance obtained from 31 ecological and agricultural studies published during 1980-2003 and conducted on 17 different plant species. The sign of the relationship between tolerance and resistance differed depending on the type of plants examined. Tolerance and resistance tended to be positively correlated in crops and negatively correlated in wild plants, but the mean correlation coefficients in both plant types were not significantly different from zero. The magnitude of correlations was affected neither by the tolerance measure (reduction in growth or in fitness in damaged plants) nor by the resistance measure used (inverse of damage, antibiosis, antixenosis, or specific resistance trait). In wild plants correlations between resistance and tolerance were significantly negative (r = -0.069) only in studies where resistance was assessed as a specific chemical or mechanical resistance trait, but this correlation is based only on two studies. No difference in the mean resistance-tolerance correlations was found between studies conducted in the field and in the greenhouse; in both cases mean correlations tended to be positive. The results of our analysis indicate that conditions under which a negative association between resistance and tolerance occurs and, thus, the evolution of multiple defensive strategies in plants is constrained, are much more restrictive than previously assumed. However, the currently available studies are still scarce and taxonomically skewed to allow a thorough analysis of sources of variation in resistance-tolerance relationship. Specifically, we need more studies examining the relationship between specific resistance and tolerance traits, studies on perennial plants and under different environmental conditions.

TI  - The Ultimate Basis of the Caching Preferences of Rodents, and the Oak-Dispersal Syndrome: Tannins, Insects, and Seed Germination
PY  - 2001
AB  - SYNOPSIS. We have shown that eastern gray squirrels and other animals consistently prefer to store intact acorns from the red oak group rather than those from the white oak group. We hypothesized that the ultimate advantage to this behavior comes from the dormancy of red oak acorns. Acorns of the white oak group germinate early in the autumn; thus, we hypothesize that avoiding germination is the primary selective advantage to the preference for caching red oak acorns. Here, we test two alternative hypotheses to explain the benefits of this caching preference: 1) storing red oak acorns allows the high tannin concentrations in red oak acorns to decline (making them more palatable), and 2) storing red oak acorns minimizes losses to insects, presuming they are less infested with insects. We also test the effect of germination schedule on squirrel caching preferences directly, by presenting them with dormant red oak acorns, and red oak acorns about to germinate. We find no evidence that tannin concentrations in red oak acorns decline, although tannin levels did decline in our white oak acorns. We found high losses to insect infestations in one white oak species, but a second white oak species lost very little mass to insects. Finally, we found that germination schedule directly affects squirrel caching preferences: red oak acorns that are near germination are treated like white oak acorns. We conclude that the primary advantage to the preference for caching red oak acorns is that they are less perishable, due to their dormancy. We discuss the effects of this preference on the dispersal of red and white oak acorns, and the subsequent effects of differential dispersal on the ecology and evolution of oaks.

TI  - BIGGER IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER: CONFLICTING SELECTIVE PRESSURES ON SEED SIZE IN QUERCUS ILEX
PY  - 2004
AB  - Most theoretical treatments of the evolutionary ecology of offspring size assume a simple and direct effect of investment per offspring on offspring fitness. In this paper I experimentally determine the relationship between seed mass and several main fitness components of the oak Quercus ilex, to estimate phenotypic selection acting on seed mass during the early life cycle and to discover any potential selective conflicts occurring between different stages from dispersal to establishment. I found a positive effect of acorn size on most fitness components related to seedling establishment. Large size increased germination rate and seedling survival, accelerated germination timing, and enhanced seedling growth. Nevertheless, there was also a direct negative effect of acorn size on survival to predation, because large acorns were highly preferred by the main postdispersal seed predators at the study site, wild boars and wood mice. Because of the low probability of escape from predation, the fitness of large acorns estimated on this component was significantly lower than the fitness of smaller acorns. Therefore, seed size affected fitness in two different ways, yielding opposing and conflicting selective forces. These findings suggest that the general assumption that offspring fitness is a fixed positive function of seed size needs to be reconsidered for some systems. The existence of conflicting selection might explain the occurrence of an optimal seed size in some plant species without invoking a seed number-size trade-off.

Its particular position makes it a part of the large scale, composite ecotone of China, and various geographical elements assemblage and transit here. Climatically,it lies in the middle subtropical zone,and the basic belt of vegetation is evergreen broad leaved forests. Because of the warm and moist climate and the rugged topography with alternating high mountains and deep valleys, it is the place with strong assemblage and defferentiation of biotic species. The Guang guang Mountain, the highest peak within this region with an elvation of 4582m, 3880m higher than the nearby plain, the vertical belts of vegetation is distinct and perfect and represents the northern part of Hengduan Mountainthe second critical regions for biodiversity;conservation in China.

AB  - Curculio fulvus Chittenden constituted ca. 93% of the weevil specimens collected from live oak, Quercus virginiana Miller, in Louisiana from 1979 to 1983. The remaining 7% consisted of C. sulcatulus (Casey), C. pardalis (Chittenden), and C. victoriensis (Chittenden). Injury to live acorns by weevil larvae significantly reduced (P < 0.01) germination and subsequent seedling growth. Adult weevils emerged from the soil from late August to mid-November. Ninety-six percent of all acorns from four trees were damaged by ovipositor insertion or by larval feeding. A mean of 2.24 larvae developed per acorn from acorns that weighed ca. 3 g.

TI  - Tannins and partial consumption of acorns: implications for dispersal of oaks by seed predators.
PY  - 1993
AB  - -A common assumption in studies of seed predation is that seeds survive attack and are dispersed only 'when animals fail to find seeds, drop undamaged seeds or fail to recover seeds after they are cached. This study, however, suggests that many acorn consumers consistently eat only a portion of the cotyledon of several species of acorns and thereby permit embryo survival. Several vertebrates [gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) and blue jays (Cyanocita cristata)] were observed to consume only 30-60% of the cotyledon from the basal portion (cap end) of willow oak (Quercus phellos) acorns. Gray squirrels exhibited a similar preference for the basal end of acorns of several other species of red oaks (Q. rubra, Q. laevis, Q. nigra, Q. palustris and Q. coccinea) from a wide geographic region. In addition, acorn weevil larvae (Curculio sp.) were observed significantly (>35%) more often in the basal portion than in the apical end of Q. alba acorns. Chemical analyses of acorns from two tree species revealed that the concentration of protein-precipitable phenolics (primarily tannins) was 12.5% (Q. phellos) and 84.2% (Q. laevis) higher in the apical portion of the seeds where the embryo is located. Moreover, germination experiments revealed equal or greater germination frequencies for partially consumed acorns than for intact acorns. We suggest that the higher tannin levels may render the apical portion less palatable, and thereby increase the probability of embryo survival after attack by seed consumers.

TI  - Insect infestation and acorn fate in Quercus liaotungensis
PY  - 2001
AB  - Insect infestation and its effects on acorn fate in Quercus liaotungensis was studied in Beijing in 1998～1999. The results showed that insect infestation influenced strongly acorn germination rate: insect-infested acorns exhibited a lower germination rate than that of noninfested ones. The infested acorns could not germinate or died eventually after germination. Seed parasitoids, two weevils, Curculio dentipes and Curculio sp., a tortricid moth, Cydia kurokoi, and an unnamed pyralid moth, developed within acorns from eggs to advanced larvae. These larvae penetrated the hard seed wall and came to hibernate under ground after acorns fell down. Of all acorns within a population, the penetrating time was not synchronized and ranged from 2 to 50 days. The infested rate of acorns was as high as 45 41%. Insect parasitism was shown to have an influence on acorn growth and development: the size-pattern of infested acorns was between that of noninfested mature ones and that of immature ones; infested acorns lost 16 05% of their fresh weight compared to those that developed normally. Based on this study, it is concluded that insect infestation decided to a great deal the fate of Quercus liaotungensis acorns and would strongly influence its regeneration.

TI  - Germination success of acorns (Quercus): insect predation and tannins
PY  - 1989
AB  - Predation by curculionid larvae, tannic acid content, and germination were measured in acorns from individual trees of Quercusalba and Quercusrubra from two sites at the Meeman Biological Field Station, Shelby County, Tennessee, U.S.A. A crossed and nested analysis of variance design was used, and no significant differences were found among trees or between sites in percentages of acorns that were attacked nor in tannic acid contents. Quercusrubra acorns had significantly less predation and higher amounts of tannic acid than Q. alba acorns. Acorns of both species that were not attacked had significantly higher germination success (82% for Q. alba and 98% for Q. rubra) than acorns that were attacked. There was no significant relationship between amount of predation and tannic acid content for acorns from trees of either species. Tannic acid content appears to have an impact by reducing seed predation and may interact with seed crop size to increase annual germination success of trees.

TI  - Guild structures of seed insects in relation to acorn development in two oak species
PY  - 2001
AB  - We investigated patterns of acorn growth in Quercus variabilis Blume and Quercus serrata Thunb., seasonal trends in emergence of seed insects found in the acorns, oviposition periods of the insects and falling periods of insect-infested acorns. In Q. variabilis, two insect guilds were associated with acorn development: (i) the immature acorn feeding (IAF) guild [Curculionidae sp., Poecilips cardamomi (Schaufuss), and Characoma ruficirra (Hampson)]; and (ii) the mature acorn feeding (MAF) guild [Curculio robustus (Roelofs), Curculio sikkimensis (Heller), and Cydia glandicolana (Danilevsky)]. In Q. serrata, there were three guilds: (i) the pistillate flower feeding (PFF) guild (cynipid wasp); (ii) the IAF guild [sap absorption by Mechoris ursulus (Roelofs)]; and (iii) the MAF guild (M. ursulus, C. sikkimensis, Cydia danilevskyi (Kuznetzov), C. glandicolana and Autostichidae sp.). The succession of guilds during acorn development may be a consequence of the use by different species of the limited food resource. The lack of a PFF guild in Q. variabilis that was found in our field site would have a positive effect on IAF guilds in utilizing the acorns.

TI  - Defence and regrowth, alternative plant strategies in the struggle against herbivores
PY  - 1988
AB  - Differences in intensity or frequency of defoliation between species do not necessarily imply differences in ultimate effect: survival or growth. Several species appear to be very successful to overcome a high defoliation pressure because of their regrowth capacity. The hypothesis is formulated that defence mechanisms and regrowth capacity are alternatives. Given a limited amount of energy and nutrients available in the struggle against herbivores, there should be a trade off between these two mechanisms. Observations on the intensity of herbivory, experiments on regrowth capacity and on storage of reserves in roots agree with the predictions based on this hypothesis. Herbivory theory is discussed and it is concluded that a short population longevity and/or a short life cycle may be one of the ways to reduce the effect of herbivory. Differences in shoot/root ratio are discussed in this context.

TI  - SEXUAL STRATEGIES IN PLANTS
PY  - 1980
AB  - Summary
It is postulated that in one reproductive session the level of maternal expenditure of an angiosperm plant is determined by a temporal series of controls on the number of potential fruit in which an investment is made. The serial adjustment hypothesis has three parts:

A. The amount of maternal expenditure is regulated at many developmental units, particularly single flowers and fruit, at three principal sequential stages – the determination of flowers, the development of ovaries and the maturation of fruit.

B. At each stage, the initiation or continuation of an investment requires an amount of available resources above a certain threshold. Hence maternal expenditure is continually adjusted to the resources available at each developmental site.

C. The pattern of controls that maximizes the maternal fitness of a plant is selected. Many factors affect the relative advantages of regulation at the three stages, therefore species and sexual morphs appear to vary widely in their proportional use of the three stages.

Regulation of flower determination has the general advantages of offering bidirectional adjustment of maternal investment, maintaining a constant ratio of maternal to paternal investment, and reducing wasted expenditure. The later stages, ovary and fruit regulation, allow secondary adjustments of maternal investment in unpredictable circumstances and permit adjustment of the relative numbers of polliniferous and seminiferous flowers. The relative advantages of restricting the numbers of developing ovaries, or of maturing fruit, depend principally on the extent to which differences in the capacity of flowers to mature fruit are evident before anthesis.

TI  - Effects of Management Practices on Narrow-leaved Snow Tussock, Chionochloa rigida
PY  - 1965
AB  - Summary Spring burning initiates physiological changes which persist for several seasons. During the first two seasons, growth of surviving tillers exceeds that in unburnt plants, but rates then decline for several seasons to values well below those of normal tussocks. This decline is preceded by prolific flowering which invariably occurs about 15 months after a fire. Stimulation of growth by reburning increases with the interval between fires. The physiological induction of flowering after fire occurs during the long days of summer and is attributed to increased temperatures in the blackened tussock crowns. Although morphological initiation usually occurs in autumn, the flowers do not emerge until the following summer so that there is more than one year's delay in the visible flowering response to spring fires. The delay is even longer in plants burnt during autumn. Doth vegetative and floral development arc earlier in recently burnt tussocks than in unburnt plants, but inflorescence height, floret size,...

TI  - Reproductive Synchrony of a Tropical Shrub: Experimental Studies on Effects of Pollinators and Seed Predators in Hybanthus Prunifolius (Violaceae)
PY  - 1981
AB  - This study compares reproductive success of individual plants flowering and fruiting in an out of synchrony with the population. I test the hypotheses that reproductive synchrony enhances a plant's ability to: (1) attract pollinators, and (2) avoid seed predators. The prediction is that an individual in synchrony with its population has higher fruit and ovule set after pollination and has more seeds at dispersal time than an individual out of synchrony. The test species is Hybanthus prunifolius (Schult.) Schulze (Violaceae), a shrub on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. It normally flowers in response to a heavy rain that interrupts a drought in the dry season. An individual produces most of its flowers on a single day. The flowers are self—compatible, but require animal vectors to effect any pollination. To test hypotheses (1) and (2) I used water sprinklers to induce individual plants to flower prior to the normal triggering rain, thereby creating a highly asynchronous population which flowered before the n...

TI  - Growth and nonstructural carbohydrate reserves in Chionochloa rigida and C. macra, and their short-term response to fire
PY  - 1978
AB  - Abstract The relationships of growth and flowering to storage of nonstructural carbohydrate reserves and the influence of the pastoral management practice of burning on these relationships have been investigated in Chionochloa rigida and C. macra on the Old Man Range, Central Otago. Growth, as measured by elongation of the youngest exposed leaf, decreased significantly with increasing altitude. It was significantly greater in C. rigida than in C. macra. Leaf dieback did not show a significant species difference, but decreased significantly with increasing altitude in C. macra. Neither new leaf nor new tiller production was significantly affected by species. The production of new tillers did, however, decrease significantly with increasing altitude in C. macra. Spring burning increased leaf elongation, relative to unburnt plants during the first two seasons after fire, C. rigida > C. macra. Leaf dieback exceeded that of unburnt plants during the season after a spring burn, but was depressed next season. Su...

TI  - Characteristics of pollen production in a population of New Zealand snow-tussock grass (Chionochloa pallens Zotov)
PY  - 1990
AB  - SUMMARY
Intraspecific variation in pollen production and pollen size were studied within a population of Chionochloa pallens, an alpine snow-tussock grass of New Zealand. I sampled plants from two sites at the altitudinal extremes (1620 and 1070 m) of the distribution of C. pallens on Mt. Hutt, South Island. There was a highly skewed distribution of pollen production among plants; the largest 10% of plants produced over a third of the pollen. In contrast to some other species, pollen production in C. pallens can be accurately estimated by simple measures such as tussock area and number of flowering shoots. Other components of yield (number of spikelets per shoot, number of florets per spikelet, and average anther length) varied significantly among individuals, but these characteristics had a small impact on total pollen yield. There was continuous variation in pollen size among individuals; between the plants with the largest and the smallest pollen grains, there was a 21 % difference in pollen diameter and a 76% difference in pollen volume. Interplant differences in pollen size have been found in a number of plants, although the biological significance of this variation is unknown. There were few differences in pollen characteristics between sites. Plants at the low-altitude site had slightly greater pollen yield because total plant size was greater.

On the basis of these comparisons the long series of State ranger observations (1909-1953) has been regionally transformed to an absolute scale of values (table 3). Calculations have been made by means of these series with the purpose of elucidating how often a certain level of cone setting occurs in various parts of the country (fig. 6) and what range of variation that might occur in respect of number of years between cone crops of a size considered worthwhile to collect (table 4).

TI  - Flowering records for Chionochloa, Aciphylla, and Celmisia species in the Craigieburn Range, South Island, New Zealand
PY  - 1981
AB  - Abstract Several species of the New Zealand mountain flora show periodic flowering. Of particular interest are the species in which mass flowerings occur after several, or sometimes many, seasons with little or no flowering. However, specific flowering patterns have rarely been elucidated. A flowering record for individual plants of species of Celmisia, Chionochloa, and Aciphylla is presented, based on up to 9 years of observations on populations at two altitudes on Mt Cockayne in the Craigie bum Range, South Island. Celmisia spectabilis flowered each season at least moderately, whereas the other species showed various degrees of periodicity. In Chionochloa macra single non-flowering seasons intervened between periods of two or three successive flowerings. Celmisia Iyallii and Aciphylla aurea flowered less frequently. Infrequency was most marked in Celmisia viscosa. This species made one mass flowering after eight seasons with virtually no flowering, and the previous mass flowering in the study population...

TI  - A brief introduction to mixed effects modelling and multi-model inference in ecology.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.

TI  - Contrasting Foraging Patterns: Testing Resource-Concentration and Dilution Effects with Pollinators and Seed Predators
PY  - 2016
AB  - Resource concentration effects occur when high resource density patches attract and support more foragers than low density patches. In contrast, resource dilution effects can occur if high density patches support fewer consumers. In this study, we examined the foraging rates of pollinators and seed predators on two perennial plant species (Rudbeckia triloba and Verbena stricta) as functions of resource density. Specifically, we examined whether resource-dense patches (densities of flower and seeds on individual plants) resulted in greater visitation and seed removal rates, respectively. We also examined whether foraging rates were context-dependent by conducting the study in two sites that varied in resource densities. For pollinators, we found negative relationships between the density of flowers per plant and visitation rates, suggesting dilution effects. For seed predators, we found positive relationships consistent with concentration effects. Saturation effects and differences in foraging behaviors might explain the opposite relationships; most of the seed predators were ants (recruitment-based foragers), and pollinators were mostly solitary foragers. We also found that foraging rates were site-dependent, possibly due to site-level differences in resource abundance and consumer densities. These results suggest that these two plant species may benefit from producing as many flowers as possible, given high levels of pollination and low seed predation.

TI  - Foraging on spatially distributed resources with sub‐optimal movement, imperfect information, and travelling costs: departures from the ideal free distribution
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ideal free distribution (IFD) theory off ers an important baseline for predicting the distribution of foragers across resource patches. Yet it is well known that IFD theory relies on several over-simplifying assumptions that are unlikely to be met in reality. Here we relax three of the most critical assumptions: (1) optimal foraging moves among patches, (2) omniscience about the utility of resource patches, and (3) cost-free travelling between patches. Based on these generalizations, we investigate the distributions of a constant number of foragers in models with explicit resource dynamics of logistic type. We fi nd that, fi rst, when foragers do not always move to the patch off ering maximum intake rate (optimal foraging), but instead move probabilistically according to diff erences in resource intake rates between patches (sub-optimal foraging), the distribution of foragers becomes less skewed than the IFD, so that high-quality patches attract fewer foragers. Second, this homogenization is strengthened when foragers have less than perfect knowledge about the utility of resource patches. Th ird, and perhaps most surprisingly, the introduction of travelling costs causes departures in the opposite direction: the distribution of sub-optimal foragers approaches the IFD as travelling costs increase. We demonstrate that these three fi ndings are robust when considering patches that diff er in the resource’s carrying capacity or intrinsic growth rate, and when considering simple two-patch and more complex multiple-patch models. By overcoming three major over-simplifi cations of IFD theory, our analyses contribute to the systematic investigation of ecological factors infl uencing the spatial distribution of foragers, and thus help in deriving new hypotheses that are testable in empirical systems. A confl uence of theoretical and empirical studies that go beyond classical IFD theory is essential for improving insights into how animal distributions across resource patches are determined in nature.

TI  - The ecology of predispersal insect herbivory on tree reproductive structures in natural forest ecosystems.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Plant-insect interactions are key model systems to assess how some species affect the distribution, the abundance, and the evolution of others. Tree reproductive structures represent a critical resource for many insect species, which can be likely drivers of demography, spatial distribution, and trait diversification of plants. In this review, we present the ecological implications of predispersal herbivory on tree reproductive structures by insects (PIHR) in forest ecosystems. Both insect's and tree's perspectives are addressed with an emphasis on how spatiotemporal variation and unpredictability in seed availability can shape such particular plant-animal interactions. Reproductive structure insects show strong trophic specialization and guild diversification. Insects evolved host selection and spatiotemporal dispersal strategies in response to variable and unpredictable abundance of reproductive structures in both space and time. If PIHR patterns have been well documented in numerous systems, evidences of the subsequent demographic and evolutionary impacts on tree populations are still constrained by time-scale challenges of experimenting on such long-lived organisms, and modeling approaches of tree dynamics rarely consider PIHR when including biotic interactions in their processes. We suggest that spatially explicit and mechanistic approaches of the interactions between individual tree fecundity and insect dynamics will clarify predictions of the demogenetic implications of PIHR in tree populations. In a global change context, further experimental and theoretical contributions to the likelihood of life-cycle disruptions between plants and their specialized herbivores, and to how these changes may generate novel dynamic patterns in each partner of the interaction are increasingly critical.

TI  - On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds
PY  - 1969
AB  - This example is provided so that non-theorists may see actual applications of the theory previously described. The Dickcissel sex ratio is employed as an indirect index of suitability. A sex ratio index was found to be correlated positively with density. This is consistent with the hypothesis that territorial behavior in the males of this species limits their density. This study provides a valid example of how the problem can be approached and offers a first step in the eventual identification of the role of territorial behavior in the habitat distribution of a common species.

TI  - Impact of founder population, drift and selection on the genetic diversity of a recently translocated tree population
PY  - 2004
AB  - Recently established, temperate tree populations combine a high level of differentiation for adaptive traits, suggesting rapid genetic evolution, with a high level of genetic diversity within population, suggesting a limited impact of genetic drift and purifying selection. To study experimentally the evolutionary forces in a recently established population, we assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of genetic diversity within a disjunct population of Cedrus atlantica established 140 years ago in south-eastern France from a North African source. The population is expanding through natural regeneration. Three generations were sampled, including founder trees. We analysed 12 isozyme loci, three of which were previously found in tight association with selected genes, and quantitative traits. No bottleneck effect was detected in the founder generation, but a simple test of allelic association revealed an initial disequilibrium which disappeared in the following generations. The impact of genetic drift during secondary evolution was limited, as suggested by the weak temporal differentiation. The genetic load was not reduced after 3 generations, and the quantitative variation for adaptive traits did not change either. Thus, initial genetic changes first proceed from a rapid re-organisation of the diversity through mating and recombination, whereas genetic erosion through drift and selection is delayed due to temporal and spatial stochasticity. Two life-history traits of trees contribute to slowing down the processes of genetic erosion: perenniality and large spatial scale. Thus, one would expect recently established tree populations to have a higher diversity than older ones, which seems in accordance with experimental surveys.

TI  - Species' borders: A unifying theme in ecology
PY  - 2004
AB  - Biologists have long been fascinated by species' borders, and with good reason. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species' borders may prove to be the key that unlocks new understanding across a wide range of biological phenomena. After all, geographic range limits are a point of entry into understanding the ecological niche and threshold responses to environmental change. Elucidating patterns of gene flow to, and returning from, peripheral populations can provide important insights into the nature of adaptation, speciation and coevolution. Species' borders form natural laboratories for the study of the spatial structure of species interactions. Comparative studies from the center to the margin of species' ranges allow us to explore species' demographic responses along gradients of increasing environmental stress. Range dynamics further permit investigation into invasion dynamics and represent bellwethers for a changing climate. This set of papers explores ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species' borders from diverse empirical and theoretical perspectives.

TI  - Plant neighborhood effects on herbivory: damage is both density and frequency dependent
PY  - 2015
AB  - Neighboring plants can affect the likelihood that a focal plant is attacked by herbivores. Both the density of conspecific neighbors (resource concentration or dilution effects) and the relative density of heterospecific neighbors (associational effects or effects of neighbor frequency) within the local neighborhood can affect herbivore load and plant damage. Understanding how these neighborhood effects influence processes such as plant competition or natural selection on plant resistance traits will require knowing how both plant density and frequency affect damage, but previous studies have generally confounded density and frequency effects. In this study, we independently manipulated the absolute density and frequency (i.e., relative density) of two plant species (Solanum carolinense and Solidago altissima) to characterize neighborhood composition effects on S. carolinense damage by herbivores, providing the first picture of how both density and frequency of neighbors influence damage in a single system. We found both a positive effect of S. carolinense density on S. carolinense damage (a resource concentration effect) and a nonlinear effect of S. altissima frequency on S. carolinense damage (associational susceptibility). If these types of patterns are common in nature, future studies seeking to understand neighborhood effects on damage need to incorporate both density and frequency effects and capture any nonlinear effects by selecting a range of values rather than focusing on only a pair of densities or frequencies. This type of data on neighborhood effects will allow us to understand the contribution of neighborhood effects to population-level processes such as competition, the evolution of plant resistance to herbivores, and yield gains in agricultural crop mixtures.

TI  - Contrasting bee foraging in response to resource scale and local habitat management
PY  - 2009
AB  - It is hypothesized that two main factors drive the foraging patterns of native and exotic species: food resource availability and habitat composition. These factors are particularly relevant for native bees and exotic honeybees, essential crop pollinators that are sensitive to floral resources and habitat management, and that have recently exhibited alarming population declines. Mechanisms driving native and exotic bee foraging patterns may critically depend on floral resource availability and habitat composition, yet the impacts of these factors on bee foraging have never been simultaneously analyzed. In a coffee producing region in southern Mexico, we investigated the influence of coffee floral resource levels and habitat management on native and exotic bee foraging. We measured the amount of flowering coffee available at multiple spatial scales within two distinct agroforestry habitat types (high-shade and low-shade coffee) and recorded visits to coffee flowers, documenting bee species, visit duration and visit frequency. We observed a significantly greater number of visits in high-shade coffee habitats than in low-shade coffee habitats for both native and exotic bees. In high-shade coffee habitats, native solitary bee and native social bee visitation decreased significantly in response to increasing floral resource availability, exhibiting a ‘dilution effect’ at the smallest spatial scale. In contrast, in low-shade coffee habitats, Africanized honeybees exhibited a ‘concentration effect’, increasing visitation significantly in response to increasing floral resource availability at the largest spatial scale. This study is the first to show that foraging patterns of native bees and exotic honeybees contrast in response to floral resource level and scale and that this response is mediated by the vegetation management of the local habitat.

TI  - Multimodel inference in ecology and evolution: challenges and solutions
PY  - 2011
AB  - Information theoretic approaches and model averaging are increasing in popularity, but this approach can be difficult to apply to the realistic, complex models that typify many ecological and evolutionary analyses. This is especially true for those researchers without a formal background in information theory. Here, we highlight a number of practical obstacles to model averaging complex models. Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.

TI  - A continuous ideal free distribution approach to the dynamics of selfish, cooperative and kleptoparasitic populations.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Population distributions depend upon the aggregate behavioural responses of individuals to a range of environmental factors. We extend a model of ideally motivated populations to describe the local and regional consequences of interactions between three populations distinguished by their levels of cooperation and exploitation. Inspired by the classic prisoner's dilemma game, stereotypical fitness functions describe a baseline non-cooperative population whose per capita fitness decreases with density, obligate co-operators who initially benefit from the presence of conspecifics, and kleptoparasites who require heterospecifics to extract resources from the environment. We examine these populations in multiple combinations, determine where both local and regional coexistence is permitted, and investigate conditions under which one population will invade another. When they invade co-operators in resource-rich areas, kleptoparasites initiate a dynamic instability that leads to the loss of both populations; however, selfish hosts, who can persist at low densities, are immune to this risk. Furthermore, adaptive movement may delay the onset of instability as dispersal relieves dynamic stress. Selfish and cooperative populations default to mutual exclusion, but asymmetric variations in interference strength may relax this condition and permit limited sympatry within the environment. Distinct sub-communities characterize the overall spatial structure.

TI  - Vegetational Diversity and Arthropod Population Response
PY  - 1991
AB  - Studies of agroecosystems during the past 30 years have lead several agri­ cultural scientists to question the commitment of modem industrial agriculture to high intensity monocultural production . Additionally, current research directions in integrated pest management emphasize biological interactions among insect pests, natural enemies, and other crop pests, such as weeds. These inquiries have led to a recent rebirth in interest and research activities on cultural and biological controls in entomology . Vegetational diversity plays a central role in this research renaissance. If one considers it broadly, vegetational diversity involves mixing different kinds of plants in a plant community, but, to paraphrase Vilfredo Pareto ( 1 12), vegetational diversity appears like a bat; within it one can find both birds and mice . More specifically, vegetational diversity varies in three ways: the kinds, the spatial array, and the temporal overlap of the plants in the mixture. In most cases, the mixed plants are different plant species. These plants might be two crops, which is called intercropping; a crop and a weed, which is called weedy culture; or a crop and a beneficial noncrop, which is known by many names including nursery crops, living-mulches, cover­ cropping, etc . In some cases, however, different plant genotypes are mixed (41), including polyvarietal mixtures of agronomically dissimilar genotypes

TI  - On Optimal Use of a Patchy Environment
PY  - 1966
AB  - A graphical method is discussed which allows a specification of the optimal diet of a predator in terms of the net amount of energy gained from a capture of prey as compared to the energy expended in searching for the prey. The method allows several predictions about changes in the degree of specialization of the diet as the numbers of different prey organisms change. For example, a more productive environment should lead to more restricted diet in numbers of different species eaten. In a patchy environment, however, this will not apply to predators that spend most of their time searching. Moreover, larger patches are used in a more specialized way than smaller patches.

TI  - The Effect of Stand Size and Vegetational Background on the Colonization of Cruciferous Plants by Herbivorous Insects
PY  - 1975
AB  - The spatial dispersion of resources is a major factor in the population dynamics of many insects. This is especially true of herbivorous species which utilize ephemeral host plants, or which must leave the host during the life cycle and subsequently rediscover it. In such situations the pattern of colonization by insects will be determined by the interaction between the plants' spatial dispersion and the insects' behaviour. This investigation attempts to answer two questions. (1) What is the effect of host plant plot size on the numbers and kinds of herbivores that occupy the stand, and (2) how does the background of a stand (i.e. the presence or absence of other vegetation) influence its colonization ? Size and background of stands are not the only aspects of host plant spatial dispersion that affect insects. Others are plant density (Dethier 1959a, b; Pimentel 1961a; Davis 1966; Way & Heathcote 1966; Clark et al. 1967; A'Brook 1968, 1973; Heathcote 1969), distance from other stands (Janzen 1968, 1970) and proximity to other environmental features including overwintering sites and alternate hosts (Wolfenbarger 1940; Moreton 1945; Wright & Ashby 1946; van Emden 1965; Lewis 1969; Johnson 1969). The former two were chosen for investigation because these characteristics in natural vegetation and agricultural crops are the most consistently different. Crops are usually grown in patches which are larger and contain fewer other kinds of plants than natural patches of their wild relatives. The prevalence of insect outbreaks on cultivated plants is related in part to these differences (Pimentel 1961b; van Emden 1964; Smith 1972; Tahvanainen & Root 1972; Root 1973). Furthermore, the same factors are important in the biological control of weeds by insects. An insect's response to large concentrations of its host plant determines its ability to control the host population, and the colonization behaviour of the species is one of the determinants of the equilibrium densities of insect and host (Huffaker 1962; Janzen 1970). Despite recognition of the importance of plant spatial dispersion for insects (Huffaker 1962; Johnson 1969), there have been few attempts to document either responses of individual insect species or the size and composition of the entire herbivore fauna in stands of different sizes. Douwes (1968) found that the female geometrid moth, Cidaria albulata L., alighted more frequently on hosts (Rhinanthus sp.) in dense clumps than on scattered hosts. In the vicinity of larger patches of Rhinanthus the flight path was shorter and the moth changed direction more frequently, apparently in response to higher concentration of the host's odour. Away from these patches, the female made longer, faster flights. Thus the behavioural pattern of Cidaria albulata caused it to remain in or near larger patches of Rhinanthus. * Present address: ENVL, Stockton State College, Pomona, N.J. 08240, U.S.A.

TI  - Dealing with overdispersed count data in applied ecology
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary
1. The ability to identify key ecological processes is important when solving applied problems. Increasingly, ecologists are adopting Akaike's information criterion (AIC) as a metric to help them assess and select among multiple process-based ecological models. Surprisingly, however, it is still unclear how best to incorporate AIC into the selection process in order to address the trade-off between maximizing the probability of retaining the most parsimonious model while minimizing the number of models retained.
 
2. Ecological count data are often observed to be overdispersed with respect to best-fitting models. Overdispersion is problematic when performing an AIC analysis, as it can result in selection of overly complex models which can lead to poor ecological inference. This paper describes and illustrates two approaches that deal effectively with overdispersion. The first approach involves modelling the causes of overdispersion implicitly using compound probability distributions. The second approach ignores the causes of overdispersion and uses quasi-AIC (QAIC) as a metric for model parsimony.
 
3. Simulations and a novel method that identifies the most parsimonious model are used to demonstrate the utility of the two overdispersion approaches within the context of two ecological examples. The first example addresses binomial data obtained from a study of fish survival (as related to habitat structure) and the second example addresses Poisson data obtained from a study of flower visitation by nectarivores.
 
4. Applying either overdispersion approach reduces the chance of selecting overly complex models, and both approaches result in very similar ecological inference. In addition, inference can be made more reliable by incorporating model nesting into the selection process (i.e. identifying which models are special cases of others), as it reduces the number of models selected without significantly reducing the probability of retaining the most parsimonious models.
 
5. Synthesis and applications. When data are overdispersed, inference can be improved by either modelling the causes of overdispersion or applying QAIC as a metric for model parsimony. Inference can also be improved by adopting a model filtering procedure based on how models are nested. The general simulation approach presented in this paper for identifying the most parsimonious model, as defined by information theory, should help to improve our understanding of the reliability of model selection when using AIC, and help the development of better selection rules.

TI  - Environmental and endogenous drivers of tree mast production and synchrony in piñon-juniper-oak woodlands of New Mexico.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Tree masting (synchronous, episodic reproduction) is common worldwide and is hypothesized to be especially important in ecosystems with low species diversity and productivity as in semi‐arid woodlands of the American Southwest. We analyzed mast dynamics of three dominant tree species, one‐seed juniper (Cupressaceae: Juniperus monosperma), two‐needle pinon pine (Pinaceae: Pinus edulis), and Sonoran scrub oak (Fagaceae: Quercus turbinella), on six sites during 1997–2016 within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico. We tested multiple hypotheses regarding environmental and endogenous variables as controlling mechanisms, analyzing time‐series mast production data in relation to weather variables (precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, wind) over different time frames, and assessed evidence for weather tracking, resource switching, resource depletion, resource cycling, and pollen limitation. We found that (1) in univariate regression analyses, mast production in all three species was inversely related to lagged late‐summer/autumn temperatures during fruit primordia formation (1‐yr lag for juniper and oak, 2‐yr lag for pinon pine). Juniper mast production (n = 412 trees) was positively related to current‐year late‐winter (February–April) precipitation, combined with a negative relationship with current‐year summer temperatures. Pinon pine mast production (n = 210 trees) was positively related to 1‐yr lagged total annual precipitation and negatively associated with current‐year spring and summer temperatures. Oak mast production (n = 194 trees) also was positively related to current‐year late‐winter precipitation but was not affected by subsequent summer temperatures. (2) Multivariate environmental logistic regression models produced reasonable fits to observed field mast values. (3) High‐mast years in juniper and oak were characterized by greater proportions of trees producing mast and increased mast production per tree. (4) Juniper, oak, and pinon pine mast years were highly synchronized. (5) We found indirect support for resource depletion in all three species at some sites and indirect support for resource cycling in oak populations. (6) We observed only marginal indirect evidence for resource switching in pinon pine and oak. (7) Analyses of atmospheric pollen abundance relative to mast production produced no significant relationships. Predictive models of mast production have direct applications to regional silviculture, wildlife management, and ecosystem services in Southwestern woodlands.

TI  - A Practical Model of Metapopulation Dynamics
PY  - 1994
AB  - This paper describes a novel approach to modelling of metapopulation dynamics. The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated

TI  - Effects of associational resistance and host density on woodland insect herbivores.
PY  - 2007
AB  - 1. Specialist herbivores often become less abundant per unit of host tissue as host density increases (resource dilution). They usually become less abundant when non-host species are mixed with their host plants (associational resistance). Most studies of these trends have involved herbaceous host plants and have not examined both trends for the same herbivores. 2. Three hypotheses were tested for the response of insect specialists to host plant density: resource concentration, plant apparency and resource dilution. Two hypotheses were tested for the response of herbivores to non-host plants: associational resistance and plant apparency. 3. From 1992 to 2007, I examined the responses of three monophagous insect herbivores to the densities of their host, Pinus edulis, and of two non-hosts, Pinus ponderosa and Juniperus spp. 4. Herbivore loads increased with host density, though the correlations were weak and often variable between generations. These results were consistent with the resource concentration and plant apparency hypotheses, but not with resource dilution. 5. Herbivore loads decreased as non-host density increased, consistent with the associational resistance hypothesis. This and other studies have shown that associational resistance is important in many types of plant communities. 6. The absence of resource dilution on woodland trees contrasted with studies of herbaceous host plants. Further comparisons of woody and herbaceous host plants are needed to elucidate the reasons for this difference.

TI  - Constraints to seed production: temperate and tropical forest trees
PY  - 1995
AB  - Reforestation requires a constant supply of high quality seed. Different methods have been used to measure seed and fruit production as a proportion of that which potentially could be produced. These estimates coupled with developmental studies permit determination of when and to what extent different biological constraints reduce seed and fruit production. These vary among species, years and sites. Overcoming biological constraints may be possible in seed orchards and seed production areas. Biological constraints include: (1) periodic or inadequate floral initiation, (2) asynchronous development and flowering, (3) floral abortion, (4) ovule abortion, (5) embryo abortion, and (6) failure of seeds and fruits to mature and our inability to determine maturity. Solutions to these constraints are varied but all must begin with an understanding of reproductive biology of each species.

TI  - Can ecological theory predict the distribution of foraging animals? A critical analysis of experiments on the ideal free distribution
PY  - 1993
AB  - Opinions differ on the empirical success of the Ideal Free Distribution. The Ideal Free model predicts that the distribution of organisms between resource sites should match the distribution of resources. Many studies report support for this prediction. We review tests of this model utilising a method of analysis derived from the psychological principle called the matching law. Our reanalysis revealed that the distribution of organisms is consistently less extreme than the distribution of resources. This systematic deviation from the Ideal Free Distribution means organisms underuse richer sites and overuse poorer sites. We examine how deviations from the Ideal Free Distribution may arise as a consequence of discrimination constraints, competitive interactions, competitive asymmetries and travel between sites, and recommend ways in which the design of future tests of the Ideal Free Distribution may be improved.

TI  - Seasonally dependent relationship between insect herbivores and host plant density in Jatropha nana, a tropical perennial herb.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The fact that plant spatial aggregation patterns shape insect herbivore communities in a variety of ways has resulted in a large body of literature on the subject. The landmark resource concentration hypothesis predicts that density of insect-herbivores per plant will increase as host plant density increases. I examined this prediction across temporal samplings using Jatropha nana and the associated specialist insect-herbivores as a system. Through 12 field samplings, I modelled the effect of host plant density on insect-herbivore loads. The initial samplings (2–3) provided evidence for the resource concentration hypothesis with insect loads increasing with increasing host plant density, whereas the later samplings (4–5, 7–11) showed the opposite- a resource dilution pattern with decline of insect loads with increasing host plant density. These patterns also depend on the biology of the herbivores and have important implications on J. nana population dynamics.

TI  - The community context of species' borders: ecological and evolutionary perspectives
PY  - 2004
AB  - Species distributional limits may coincide with hard dispersal barriers or physiological thresholds along environmental gradients, but they may also be influenced by species interactions. We explore a number of models of interspecific interactions that lead to (sometimes abrupt) distribution limits in the presence and absence of environmental gradients. We find that gradients in competitive ability can lead to spatial segregation of competitors into distinct ranges, but that spatial movement tends to broaden the region of sympatry between the two species, and that Allee effects tend to sharpen these boundaries. We generalize these simple models to include metapopulation dynamics and other types of interactions including predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. We derive conditions for range limits in each case. We also consider models that include coevolution and gene flow and find that character displacement along environmental gradients can lead to stable parapatric distributions. We conclude that it is essential to consider coevolved species interactions as a potential mechanism limiting species distributions, particularly when barriers to dispersal are weak and environmental gradients are gradual.

TI  - AD Model Builder: using automatic differentiation for statistical inference of highly parameterized complex nonlinear models
PY  - 2012
AB  - Many criteria for statistical parameter estimation, such as maximum likelihood, are formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty.

TI  - Epidemiology of asexuality induced by the endosymbiotic Wolbachia across phytophagous wasp species: host plant specialization matters.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Among eukaryotes, sexual reproduction is by far the most predominant mode of reproduction. However, some systems maintaining sexuality appear particularly labile and raise intriguing questions on the evolutionary routes to asexuality. Thelytokous parthenogenesis is a form of spontaneous loss of sexuality leading to strong distortion of sex ratio towards females and resulting from mutation, hybridization or infection by bacterial endosymbionts. We investigated whether ecological specialization is a likely mechanism of spread of thelytoky within insect communities. Focusing on the highly specialized genus Megastigmus (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), we first performed a large literature survey to examine the distribution of thelytoky in these wasps across their respective obligate host plant families. Second, we tested for thelytoky caused by endosymbionts by screening in 15 arrhenotokous and 10 thelytokous species for Wolbachia, Cardinium, Arsenophonus and Rickettsia endosymbionts and by performing antibiotic treatments. Finally, we performed phylogenetic reconstructions using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to examine the evolution of endosymbiont-mediated thelytoky in Megastigmus and its possible connections to host plant specialization. We demonstrate that thelytoky evolved from ancestral arrhenotoky through the horizontal transmission and the fixation of the parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia. We find that ecological specialization in Wolbachia's hosts was probably a critical driving force for Wolbachia infection and spread of thelytoky, but also a constraint. Our work further reinforces the hypothesis that community structure of insects is a major driver of the epidemiology of endosymbionts and that competitive interactions among closely related species may facilitate their horizontal transmission.

TI  - Linking niche theory to ecological impacts of successful invaders: insights from resource fluctuation-specialist herbivore interactions
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary
Theories of species coexistence and invasion ecology are fundamentally connected and provide a common theoretical framework for studying the mechanisms underlying successful invasions and their ecological impacts. Temporal fluctuations in resource availability and differences in life-history traits between invasive and resident species are considered as likely drivers of the dynamics of invaded communities. Current critical issues in invasion ecology thus relate to the extent to which such mechanisms influence coexistence between invasive and resident species and to the ability of resident species to persist in an invasive-dominated ecosystem.
We tested how a fluctuating resource, and species trait differences may explain and help predict long-term impacts of biological invasions in forest specialist insect communities. We used a simple invasion system comprising closely related invasive and resident seed-specialized wasps (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) competing for a well-known fluctuating resource and displaying divergent diapause, reproductive and phenological traits.
Based on extensive long-term field observations (1977–2010), we developed a combination of mechanistic and statistical models aiming to (i) obtain a realistic description of the population dynamics of these interacting species over time, and (ii) clarify the respective contributions of fluctuation-dependent and fluctuation-independent mechanisms to long-term impact of invasion on the population dynamics of the resident wasp species.
We showed that a fluctuation-dependent mechanism was unable to promote coexistence of the resident and invasive species. Earlier phenology of the invasive species was the main driver of invasion success, enabling the invader to exploit an empty niche. Phenology also had the greatest power to explain the long-term negative impact of the invasive on the resident species, through resource pre-emption.
This study provides strong support for the critical role of species differences in interspecific competition outcomes within animal communities. Our mechanistic-statistical approach disentangles the critical drivers of novel species assemblages resulting from intentional and non-intentional introductions of non-native species.

Les Processionnaires en sont exclues. La tordeuse du Cedre du Liban, Acleris undulana, un redoutable ravageur en Asie Mineure, a colonise les cedraies atlasiques marocaines. Le cedre du Grand Atlas marocain est l'objet de deperissements dans lesquels interviennent des insectes xylophages. En France, 7 especes d'insectes indigenes, au moins, se sont portees sur le nouveau conifere. La tordeuse du sapin pectine Choristoneura murinana a cause des degâts importants dans la cedraie du Luberon et les xylophages ont fait leur apparition au Ventoux. Par ailleurs, cinq especes d'insectes provenant de l'aire naturelle du cedre sont parvenues en France et certains en Europe : la tordeuse du cedre Epinotia cedricida, les pucerons Cedrobium laportei et Cinara cedri, les chalcidiens seminivores Megastigmus pinsapinis et Megastigmus schimitscheki.

TI  - Considering ecological dynamics in resource selection functions
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. Describing distribution and abundance is requisite to exploring interactions between organisms and their environment. Recently, the resource selection function (RSF) has emerged to replace many of the statistical procedures used to quantify resource selection by animals. 2. A RSF is defined by characteristics measured on resource units such that its value for a unit is proportional to the probability of that unit being used by an organism. It is solved using a variety of techniques, particularly the binomial generalized linear model. 3. Observing dynamics in a RSF – obtaining substantially different functions at different times or places for the same species – alerts us to the varying ecological processes that underlie resource selection. 4. We believe that there is a need for us to reacquaint ourselves with ecological theory when interpreting RSF models. We outline a suite of factors likely to govern ecologically based variation in a RSF. In particular, we draw attention to competition and density-dependent habitat selection, the role of predation, longitudinal changes in resource availability and functional responses in resource use. 5. How best to incorporate governing factors in a RSF is currently in a state of development; however, we see promise in the inclusion of random as well as fixed effects in resource selection models, and matched case–control logistic regression. 6. Investigating the basis of ecological dynamics in a RSF will allow us to develop more robust models when applied to forecasting the spatial distribution of animals. It may also further our understanding of the relative importance of ecological interactions on the distribution and abundance of species.

TI  - The ideal free distribution when the resource is variable
PY  - 2003
AB  - On the basis of the ideal free distribution (IFD) model, two stochastic models that incorporate the uncertainty of the information used for decision making were considered to investigate the effects of the variability in the resource supply rate on the IFD under continuous input conditions. In the uncertain-information model, competitors cannot trace the variation of the supply rate and use the expectation of the supply rate or previous payoffs for decision making. Both submodels predict matching of means, in which the average number of competitors for each patch is proportional to the average supply rate in the patch. In the perfect-information model, competitors continuously know and trace the environment conditions. Numerical predictions depend on the relative size of the resource variance between patches. When the resource variance in the good patch is sufficiently larger than that in the poor patch, it predicts undermatching of means; when the variance of the supply rate for each patch is small and proportional to the average of the supply rate in the patch, it predicts matching of means; and when the resource variance in the poor patch is larger than (or equal to) that in the good patch, it predicts overmatching of means. These results indicate the importance of clarifying the assumption on the uncertainty in information for decision making and the type of the resource variance for the test of the IFD under conditions where the resource supply rate is stochastic.

TI  - Using observation-level random effects to model overdispersion in count data in ecology and evolution
PY  - 2014
AB  - Overdispersion is common in models of count data in ecology and evolutionary biology, and can occur due to missing covariates, non-independent (aggregated) data, or an excess frequency of zeroes (zero-inflation). Accounting for overdispersion in such models is vital, as failing to do so can lead to biased parameter estimates, and false conclusions regarding hypotheses of interest. Observation-level random effects (OLRE), where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that models the extra-Poisson variation present in the data, are commonly employed to cope with overdispersion in count data. However studies investigating the efficacy of observation-level random effects as a means to deal with overdispersion are scarce. Here I use simulations to show that in cases where overdispersion is caused by random extra-Poisson noise, or aggregation in the count data, observation-level random effects yield more accurate parameter estimates compared to when overdispersion is simply ignored. Conversely, OLRE fail to reduce bias in zero-inflated data, and in some cases increase bias at high levels of overdispersion. There was a positive relationship between the magnitude of overdispersion and the degree of bias in parameter estimates. Critically, the simulations reveal that failing to account for overdispersion in mixed models can erroneously inflate measures of explained variance (r2), which may lead to researchers overestimating the predictive power of variables of interest. This work suggests use of observation-level random effects provides a simple and robust means to account for overdispersion in count data, but also that their ability to minimise bias is not uniform across all types of overdispersion and must be applied judiciously.

TI  - Temporal variation in plant neighborhood effects on the defoliation of primary and secondary hosts by an insect pest
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Plant neighborhood effects on herbivore damage have been observed in many systems although few studies have assessed the different component effects of the neighborhood (conspecific neighbors vs. heterospecific neighbors) on defoliation. No earlier studies have monitored how temporal scale influences neighborhood effects. We tested hypotheses on resource concentration/dilution and associational effects in the eastern spruce budworm (<jats:italic>Choristoneura fumiferana</jats:italic>)–forest system over a 10‐yr period across different stands including stands dominated by highly vulnerable hosts (balsam fir), stands dominated by a species with low vulnerability (black spruce), and mixed composition stands (fir and spruce). We observed persistent resource concentration effects on the primary host (balsam fir) during the increasing phase of the outbreak in balsam fir‐dominated and mixed stands, while both resource dilution and associational susceptibility effects were observed on the secondary host (black spruce) and the strength of associational susceptibility increased with an increase in resource dilution. We did not observe associational effects on the primary host in mixed and secondary host‐dominated stands but in stands dominated by the primary host, we observed associational resistance when the resource was highly depleted. Therefore, the complexity of neighborhood effects suggests that future studies should consider the separate effects of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors, as well as changes through time in order to predict herbivore damage in different systems, and provide better preventive and reactive strategies to manage herbivore outbreaks.</jats:p>

TI  - Ideal Free Distributions, Evolutionary Games, and Population Dynamics in Multiple-Species Environments
PY  - 2004
AB  - In this article, we develop population game theory, a theory that combines the dynamics of animal behavior with popu- lation dynamics. In particular, we study interaction and distribution of two species in a two-patch environment assuming that individuals behave adaptively (i.e., they maximize Darwinian fitness). Either the two species are competing for resources or they are in a predator- prey relationship. Using some recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we extend the classical ideal free distribution (IFD) concept for single species to two interacting species. We study population dynamical consequences of two-species IFD by comparing two sys- tems: one where individuals cannot migrate between habitats and one where migration is possible. For single species, predator-prey interactions, and competing species, we show that these two types of behavior lead to the same population equilibria and corresponding species spatial distributions, provided interspecific competition is patch independent. However, if differences between patches are such that competition is patch dependent, then our predictions strongly depend on whether animals can migrate or not. In particular, we show that when species are settled at their equilibrium population densities in both habitats in the environment where migration be- tween habitats is blocked, then the corresponding species spatial distribution need not be an IFD. Thus, when species are given the opportunity to migrate, they will redistribute to reach an IFD (e.g.,

We assume that readers are familiar with the information-theoretic approaches and provide several examples of misuse. Any method can be misused-our purpose here is to suggest constructive ways to avoid misuse.

TI  - The Role of Time and Energy in Food Preference
PY  - 1966
AB  - A model which relates optimal food preference relationships and caloric yield per unit time of potential food sources is derived. It is suggested, on the basis of this model, that: 1) Food preferences can be adequately described only if a number of factors other than relative frequencies in the diet and relative abundances of the food types are known. 2) Animals should be more selective in their choice of foods when satiated or when food is common, more indiscriminate when starved or when food is scarce. 3) Animals may eat one food type with greater frequency, relative to its abundance, than another even if the other food is richer and more efficiently exploited. This occurs in situations of high relative abundance of the first food type. 4) The extent to which predators tend to pass by potential food items may be used to evaluate the role of food in the population limitation of a predator species. 5) Food preferences appear to change readily and appropriately to changes in the environment. preferences a ...

TI  - Resource dilution effects on specialist insect herbivores in a grassland biodiversity experiment
PY  - 2005
AB  - 1. The resource concentration hypothesis predicts that specialist insect herbivores attain higher loads (density per unit mass of the host-plant species) when their food plants grow in high-density patches in pure stands.

2. We tested the resource concentration hypothesis for nine specialist insect herbivore species sampled from a field experiment where plant diversity had been manipulated experimentally, generating gradients of host-plant abundance.

3. The specialist insects responded to varying host-plant abundance in two contrasting ways: as expected, specialist herbivore species were more likely to be present when their host-plant species were abundant; however, counter to predictions, in plots where specialists were present we found strong negative linear relationships between herbivore loads and host-plant abundances - a 'resource dilution' rather than concentration effect.

4. Increased plant species-richness had an additional, but weak, negative influence on loads beyond that due to host-plant abundance.

5. We discuss the implications of resource dilution effects for biodiversity manipulation experiments and for the study of plant–herbivore interactions more generally.

TI  - The ideal free pike: 50 years of fitness-maximizing dispersal in Windermere.
PY  - 2006
AB  - The ideal free distribution (IFD) theory is one of the most influential theories in evolutionary ecology. It predicts how animals ought to distribute themselves within a heterogeneous habitat in order to maximize lifetime fitness. We test the population level consequence of the IFD theory using 40-year worth data on pike (Esox lucius) living in a natural lake divided into two basins. We do so by employing empirically derived density-dependent survival, dispersal and fecundity functions in the estimation of basin-specific density-dependent fitness surfaces. The intersection of the fitness surfaces for the two basins is used for deriving expected spatial distributions of pike. Comparing the derived expected spatial distributions with 50 years data of the actual spatial distribution demonstrated that pike is ideal free distributed within the lake. In general, there was a net migration from the less productive north basin to the more productive south basin. However, a pike density-manipulation experiment imposing shifting pike density gradients between the two basins managed to switch the net migration direction and hence clearly demonstrated that the Windermere pike choose their habitat in an ideal free manner. Demonstration of ideal free habitat selection on an operational field scale like this has never been undertaken before.

TI  - ASSOCIATIONAL SUSCEPTIBILITY: EFFECTS OF CROPPING PATTERN AND FERTILIZER ON MALAWIAN BEAN FLY LEVELS'
PY  - 1995
AB  - Subsistence farmers with little access to costly pesticides must rely on cul- tural practices to enhance biological control, reduce crop apparency or suitability to pests, or increase crop tolerance to pests. Farmers in Central Malawi traditionally plant beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with the first rains and apply fertilizer to bean only when it is grown in dicultures with maize (Zea mays L.). I used a factorial experiment with a key pest of beans to assess the relative effects of fertilizer (predicted to increase pest levels) and intercropping (predicted to decrease pest densities). Stem-boring bean fly (Diptera: Agromyzidae) densities and their parasitism rates were compared with respect to cropping pattern, fertilizer application, sowing date, and varietal diversity of beans. Together these factors address the effects of current practices (intercropping, mixed varieties) on bean fly infestation rates and those now encouraged for increased production (relay cropping, fer- tilized monoculture). In addition, associational resistance in this system is tested in the context of actual farming practices. In contrast to many other studies of specialist herbivores, neither the densities of bean flies (Ophiomyia phaseoli (Tryon) and 0. spencerella (Greathead)) nor their rates of par- asitism were changed significantly by diversifying the field with non-host plants (bean- maize dicultures). However, the two fly species were differentially susceptible to plant quality and parasitism, with fertilized bean plants harboring more bean fly puparia than did unfertilized plants regardless of cropping pattern. Thus, the indirect effect of fertilizing intercrops resulted in elevated pest densities. Differential plant quality has not been included in most studies of intercropping and pest incidence, yet reflects actual farming practices. Bean fly densities tended to increase in plants sown later in the wet season, suggesting that relay cropping of beans will exacerbate bean fly damage. In this study, greater yields were achieved in mixed variety bean treatments, but standard fertilizer applications did not contribute to increased bean production.

TI  - Influence of target plant density on herbivorous insect oviposition choice: Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (Asteraceae) and Zygogramma suturalis F. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)
PY  - 1993
AB  - Zygogramma suturalis F. has been introduced to Russia for the biological control of the common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. The functional response of Z. suturalis to the density of the target plant was studied at two levels: between plants and between 0.1 m2 sampling plots. The number of Z. suturalis eggs per unit of plant weight was almost independent of plant weight, indicating that a functional response between plants is absent. However, tall and intermediate height plants received more eggs per phytomass unit than short plants. Between plots, correlation analysis showed that absolute Z. suturalis egg density is positively dependent on the ragweed density. Experiments showed that the locomotor activity of ovipositing females decreased when on the ragweed, suggesting orthokinesis. The number of leaf beetle eggs per unit of ragweed weight was negatively correlated with host plant density in May‐June, when the majority of eggs are laid, but was positively correlated in July and loosely, or not sign...

TI  - Risk of predation makes foragers less choosy about their food
PY  - 2017
AB  - Animals foraging in the wild have to balance speed of decision making and accuracy of assessment of a food item's quality. If resource quality is important for maximizing fitness, then the duration of decision making may be in conflict with other crucial and time consuming tasks, such as anti-predator behaviours or competition monitoring. Individuals facing the risk of predation and/or competition should adjust the duration of decision making and, as a consequence, their level of choosiness for resources. When exposed to predation, the forager could either maintain its level of choosiness for food items but accept a reduction in the amount of food items consumed or it could reduce its level of choosiness and accept all prey items encountered. Under competition risk, individuals are expected to reduce their level of choosiness as slow decision making exposes individuals to a higher risk of opportunity costs. To test these predictions, the level of choosiness of a seed-eating carabid beetle, Harpalus affinis, was examined under 4 different experimental conditions of risk: i) predation risk; ii) intraspecific competition; iii) interspecific competition; and, iv) control. All the risks were simulated using chemical cues from individual conspecifics or beetles of different species that are predatory or granivorous. Our results show that when foraging under the risk of predation, H. affinis individuals significantly reduce their level of choosiness for seeds. Reductions in level of choosiness for food items might serve as a sensible strategy to reduce both the total duration of a foraging task and the cognitive load of the food quality assessment. No significant differences were observed when individuals were exposed to competition cues. Competition, (i.e opportunity cost) may not be perceived as risk high enough to induce changes in the level of choosiness. Our results suggest that considering the amount of items consumed, alone, would be a misleading metric when assessing individual response to a risk of predation. Foraging studies should therefore also take in account the decision making process.

PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:p>1. Mast seeding is a widespread resource pulse caused by synchronized and intermittent production of a large seed crop by plant populations.

An immediate bottom‐up effect of seed production on weevil larval abundance was detected, which was driven by an increase in realised fecundity and aggregation at seed‐rich trees. Moreover, trees producing on average more and larger acorns sustained larger weevil populations. However, no correlation was found between current and previous year adult abundance, suggesting that <jats:italic>C. elephas</jats:italic> did not capitalise on the reproductive bottom‐up effect.</jats:p><jats:p>4. It was rainfall, not masting, that most strongly shaped the temporal variation in insect abundance. Rainfall facilitates emergence after diapause at underground earth cells and was also responsible for among‐tree synchronisation in adult weevil population dynamics.</jats:p><jats:p>5. In spite of their trophic specialisation, not only food availability, but also weather affects weevil numbers. The present results indicate that moving beyond bottom‐up effects is required to better understand complex systems that involve masting plants and insects that consume their seeds.</jats:p>

TI  - Impacts of Insect Herbivores on Plant Populations
PY  - 2016
AB  - Apparent feeding damage by insects on plants is often slight. Thus, the influences of insect herbivores on plant populations are likely minor. The role of insects on host-plant populations can be elucidated via several methods: stage-structured life tables of plant populations manipulated by herbivore exclusion and seed-addition experiments, tests of the enemy release hypothesis, studies of the effects of accidentally and intentionally introduced insect herbivores, and observations of the impacts of insect species that show outbreak population dynamics. These approaches demonstrate that some, but not all, insect herbivores influence plant population densities. At times, insect-feeding damage kills plants, but more often, it reduces plant size, growth, and seed production. Plant populations for which seed germination is site limited will not respond at the population level to reduced seed production. Insect herbivores can influence rare plant species and need to be considered in conservation programs. Alterations due to climate change in the distributions of insect herbivores indicate the possibility of new influences on host plants. Long-term studies are required to show if density-related insect behavior stabilizes plant populations or if environmental variation drives most temporal fluctuations in plant densities. Finally, insects can influence plant populations and communities through changing the diversity of nonhost species, modifying nutrient fluxes, and rejuvenating over mature forests.

TI  - Patterns of herbivore incidence on experimental arrays and field populations of ragwort, Senecio jacobaea
PY  - 1999
AB  - Despite predictions that herbivorous insects should selectively attack high-density host populations, research suggests that different herbivores may exhibit very different responses to host density. I surveyed natural and experimentally planted populations of common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) for a variety of herbivorous insects. Early and late instar cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) larvae differed significantly in their incidence patterns on the experimental arrays, with young caterpillars most prevalent on closely spaced hosts, and older caterpillars on more widely spaced plants. The difference suggests opposite density biases may apply to maternal oviposition and larval dispersal behaviours. Two other herbivores (the leaf miner Chromatomyia syngenesiae and the flowerhead boring Botanophila spp.) showed significant biases towards low density hosts in the experimental plantings. In natural populations, another leaf miner, Liriomyza strigata, preferentially attacked low-density plants, whilst C. syngenesiae incidence was highest at intermediate host densities. The difference between natural and experimental populations suggests a difference between colonisation dynamics and longer-term population effects. I review and contrast six possible explanations for the diversity of density responses found amongst herbivores in this and other comparable studies. Most are at least qualitatively consistent with the patterns observed here, and thus require additional research to differentiate.

TI  - TESTING ECOLOGICAL THEORY USING THE INFORMATION‐THEORETIC APPROACH: EXAMPLES AND CAUTIONARY RESULTS
PY  - 2005
AB  - Ecologists are increasingly applying model selection to their data analyses, primarily to compare regression models. Model selection can also be used to compare mechanistic models derived from ecological theory, thereby providing a formal framework for testing the theory. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is the most commonly adopted criterion used to compare models; however, its performance in general is not very well known. The best model according to AIC has the smallest expected Kullback-Leibler (K-L) distance, which is an information-theoretic measure of the difference between a model and the truth. I review the theory behind AIC and demonstrate how it can be used to test ecological theory by considering two example studies of foraging, motivated by simple foraging theory. I present plausible truths for the two studies, and models that can be fit to the foraging data. K-L distances are calculated for simulated studies, which provide an appropriate test of AIC. Results support the use of a commonly adopted rule of thumb for selecting models based on AIC differences. However, AICc, a corrected version of AIC commonly used to reduce model selection bias, showed no clear improvement, and model averaging, a technique to reduce model prediction bias, gave mixed results.

TI  - Genotypically diverse cultivar mixtures for insect pest management and increased crop yields
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. In modern crop production, each plant is often nearly genetically identical to its neighbours, allowing insect pests and pathogens to move easily from plant to plant and decimate crop fields. The associational resistance and enemies hypotheses predict that increasing plant diversity in agricultural fields will reduce pest abundance and damage. Ample research has supported these hypotheses by demonstrating that increased plant species diversity can improve insect pest management via bottom–up and top–down mechanisms. In spite of this support, diversification strategies that might contribute to improved pest control and yield have not been widely adopted owing to logistical and financial constraints. 2. Basic and applied research is increasingly demonstrating the value of intraspecific genetic diversity for improving ecosystem stability and function. Thus, a more practical way of diversifying crop fields may be to increase plant genotypic diversity by planting cultivar mixtures. Our objective is to review the literature documenting the benefits of genotypic diversity for natural and agricultural ecosystems and synthesize the evidence in support of intraspecific diversity as a viable pest management strategy for insect pests of field crops. We found strong support for wide-ranging benefits of genotypic diversity that improved plant fitness and productivity in natural and applied settings. 3. Multiple lines of evidence converge to support the potential of intraspecific variation to contribute to improve insect pest control. However, very little work has sought to develop empirical support or viable implementation practices in agricultural systems. Thus, implementation of this practice is limited. 4. Synthesis and applications. Intraspecific plant diversity can improve plant fitness via bottom–up and top–down effects on pest populations and niche partitioning. Further research is required to refine implementation practices and demonstrate value in terms of reduced pesticide use and increased yield. Growers can implement intraspecific crop diversity with minimal financial investment or changes in production practices. As the benefits of biodiversity for yield stability are increasingly recognized, intraspecific diversity is poised to become a prominent and sustainable management tactic.

TI  - Rapid aggregative and reproductive responses of weevils to masting of North American oaks counteract predator satiation.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The predator satiation hypothesis posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, followed by satiation of predators in mast years. Importantly, successful satiation requires sufficiently delayed bottom-up effects of seed availability on seed consumers. However, some seed consumers may be capable of quick aggregative and reproductive responses to masting, which may jeopardize positive density dependence of seed survival. We used a 17-yr data set on seed production and insect (Curculio weevils) infestation of three North American oaks species (northern red Quercus rubra, white Q. alba, and chestnut oak Q. montana) to test predictions of the predation satiation hypothesis. Furthermore, we tested for the unlagged numerical response of Curculio to acorn production. We found that masting results in a bottom-up effect on the insect population; both through increased reproductive output and aggregation at seed-rich trees. Consequently, mast seeding in two out of three studied oaks (white and chestnut oak) did not help to escape insect seed predation, whereas, in the red oak, the escape depended on the synchronization of mast crops within the population. Bottom-up effects of masting on seed consumer populations are assumed to be delayed, and therefore to have negligible effects on seed survival in mast years. Our research suggests that insect populations may be able to mount rapid reproductive and aggregative responses when seed availability increases, possibly hindering satiation effects of masting. Many insect species are able to quickly benefit from pulsed resources, making mechanisms described here potentially relevant in many other systems.

TI  - Spillover of agriculturally subsidized predators as a potential threat to native insect herbivores in fragmented landscapes.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have strong negative impacts on populations of some native species. Spillover of generalist natural enemies from the surrounding landscape matrix is one mechanism potentially generating such effects, yet this has been rarely studied in insects. We examined the influence of habitat conversion to agriculture on the abundance and potential effects of predatory coccinellid beetles on native insect herbivores within 12 grassland remnants in central Nebraska (U.S.A.). Results of sweep sampling revealed that coccinellids were three to six times more abundant at native grassland sites embedded within cropland-dominated landscapes compared with control sites in grassland-dominated landscapes over the 3 years of the study. Exclusion experiments further demonstrated that predation intensity was strongly related to coccinellid abundances across sites and that coccinellids can dramatically reduce densities of a native aphid herbivore. In contrast to studies of specialized insect parasitoids, which have generally found reduced enemy pressure in fragmented landscapes, our results suggest that native herbivores may in some cases experience increased consumer pressure in landscapes with increasing habitat loss because of spillover of generalist predators from surrounding cropland habitats.

TI  - EFFECTS OF TREE DENSITY, TREE SPECIES DIVERSITY, AND PERCENTAGE OF HARDSCAPE ON THREE INSECT PESTS OF HONEYLOCUST
PY  - 2001
AB  - Honeylocust (Gleditsia twaanthos L. var. inemnis) trees in urban areas are attacked principally by three insect pests: honeylocust plant bug, nirmosa web- wormn, and honeylocust spider mite. One hundred honeylocust trees on the Purdue University campus were studied to better understand the influence of landscape characteristics on the populations of these insect pests. Specifically, the amount of hardscape, defined as impervi- ousness under and around trees, including roads, side- walks, parking lots, and buildings; density of honeylocust; and diversity of tree species around each tree were calcu- lated at nurnerous spatial scales and correlated with insect pest abundance on honeylocust. Each of these landscape factors influenced insect pest and their natural enemy populations on honeylocust trees at a wide range of scales. No single combination of these factors was associated with lower densities of honeylocust pests.

TI  - VISUAL RESPONSES OF APPLE MAGGOT FLIES, RHAGOLETIS POMONELLA (DIPTERA: TEPHRITIDAE): ORCHARD STUDIES
PY  - 1968
AB  - Apple maggot flies, Rhagoletis pomonella, were found to be highly responsive to visual stimuli, with maximum responses dependent upon color, shape, and size characteristics of the stimulus. Each sex had a significant preference for yellow 30 × 40 cm rectangles over green, orange, red, blue, violet, black, white and clear rectangles of the same size. On the other hand, each sex had a significant preference for red, blue, violet, dark orange, and black spheres 7.5 cm in diameter over green, light orange, yellow, white, and clear spheres of the same size. Both sexes had a significant preference for 7.5 cm spheres over equivalent-sized cubes, cylinders and rectangles. As the diameter of a sphere was increased from 7.5 to 45 cm, there was an orderly and significant decrease in the attractiveness of those that were dark-colored (red) but a progressive and significant increase in the attractiveness of those that were yellow. The flies did not congregate on trees with apples or respond strongly to 7.5 cm, dark-colored spheres until they were sexually mature (at least in the case of females). Relative to other colors, females were often significantly more attracted than males to yellow. The attractiveness of an olfactory stimulus eliciting feeding-type reactions was enhanced to a substantial degree when employed in conjunction with a 30 × 40 cm yellow rectangle, but to only a very slight degree when in conjunction with a 7.5 cm red sphere.



Evidence presented suggests the following explanation for these findings. The flies are attracted to large surfaces of yellow because they react to yellow, on the basis of true color discrimination, as if it were foliage on which to find food. On the other hand, they are attracted to small, dark-colored spheres because they react to such spheres as they react to apples, which are the oviposition site and which also appear to serve as a rendezvous site for the sexes in mating activity. Once the flies have arrived on apple trees, they detect apples solely through vision. Red, blue, violet, dark orange, and black small spheres are preferred over small spheres of other colors on the basis that they stand out in strongest contrast against the background and not on the basis of true color discrimination. Large, dark-colored spheres are unattractive because the range of sphere sizes eliciting positive responses is near the size of an apple.



These findings have proven useful in designing effective devices for sampling orchard populations of the flies and may also prove useful in fly control.



ZUSAMMENFASSUNG

DAS VISUELLE VERHALTEN DER APFELFLIEGE, RHAGOLETIS POMONELLA IM FREILAND (DIPTERA: TRYPETIDAE)



Imagines von Rhagoletis pomonella reagieren positiv auf visuelle Reize, wobei Farbe, Form und Grosse des Stimulus von ausschlaggebender Bedeutung sind. Beide Geschlechter zeigten in den Versuchen eine signifikante Praferenz fur gelbe Rechtecke (30 × 40 cm), die sie haufiger anflogen als grune, orange, rote, blaue, violette, schwarze, weisse und farblose Flachen gleicher Grosse. Ebenso zeigte es sich, dass Kugeln von 7.5 cm Durchmesser von den Fliegen eindeutig Kuben, Zylindern und Rechtecken gleicher Grossenordnung fur den Anflug bevorzugt wurden. Mit zunehmendem Durchmesser der Kugeln von 7.5 cm bis 45 cm konnte eine abnehmende Anziehung von dunkel gefarbten Kugeln, jedoch eine zunehmende Anziehung von gelben Kugeln auf die Fliegen beobachtet werden. Vor der Geschlechtsreife reagierten die Weibchen nicht in ausgepragtem Mase auf die 7.5 cm dunkel gefarbte grossen Kugeln, sondern wurden mehr als die Mannchen von Gelb angezogen. Die Wirkung eines Nahrungskoders wurde in Kombination mit einer gelben Flache von 30 × 40 cm signifikant erhoht, wahrend die Kombination des Koders mit einer roten Kugel von 7.5 cm Durchmesser die Anziehung von Weibchen nur unwesentlich erhohte.



Die Resultate lassen sich damit erklaren, dass die Fliegen durch gelbe Flachen angezogen werden, weil sie dank Diskriminierung der Farbe auf Gelb reagieren als ware es Blattwerk, auf dem sich die Nahrungsquellen befinden. Auf der anderen Seite werden sie von dunklen Kugeln in den Dimensionen eines Apfels angezogen, da im Freiland Apfel Orte fur die Eiablage und offenbar Treffpunkte fur die Geschlechter darstellen. Sobald die Fliegen den Apfelbaum beflogen haben, orientieren sie sich allein mit dem Gesichtssinn gegen die Fruchte. Kleinere rote, blaue, dunkel orange, violette und schwarze Kugeln werden anders gefarbten vorgezogen, weil sie den grossten Kontrast gegenuber dem Hintergrund bilden und nicht auf Grund echter Farbdiskriminierung. Grosse dunkle Kugeln verlieren ihre Wirkung auf die Fliegen, weil nur Kugeln in der Grossenordnung eines Apfels positive Reaktionen auslosen.



Diese Befunde haben sich als nutzlich erwiesen in der Ausarbeitung von Sammelmethoden fur Freilandpopulationen und durften auch in der Bekampfung der Apfelfliegen Anwendung finden.

TI  - Responses of a specialist and a generalist seed predator to variation in their common resource.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Sweden. Fluctuations of resources in time and space will influence not only species abundance but also interactions among species. For plantconsumer interactions, the effects of resource variation have mostly been studied in systems with high resource variability. Systems with moderate variations are less studied, although ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plants and consumers are likely to be affected also by less extreme variability. The effects of variation in a particular resource should depend on consumer diet width. We examined how spatial and temporal variation in seed production in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus influenced population dynamics and resource utilization in two beetle pre-dispersal seed predators with different host ranges over six years. The monophagous Apion opeticum occupied fewer patches and had lower densities than the oligophagous Bruchus atomarius. The proportion of seeds attacked increased with increases in seed production between years for both seed predators. A possible explanation for these patterns is that population dynamics of beetles are driven largely by local factors and that the same factors influence both beetle performance and seed production. In B. atomarius, patterns may also be influenced by a more pronounced preference for L. vernus in years with a high seed production in L. vernus .W e conclude that relatively modest variation in seed production may result in responses that differ in both direction and extent from those usually observed in systems with high variation in seed production.

TI  - Dispersal and dormancy strategies among insect species competing for a pulsed resource
PY  - 2013
AB  - Dormancy and dispersal are thought to be major adaptive mechanisms that enable short-lived organisms to cope with environmental stochasticity. The few empirical investigations that have explored the relationship between these two strategies in disturbed environments have focused mainly on communities of annual desert plants and suggest that dispersal plays a negligible role, as compared with dormancy, in reducing the risk of genotype extinction. We predict that the relative advantage of dormancy versus dispersal is likely to be more balanced in species that disperse actively to select their reproductive locality. To examine this prediction, we explored the dormancy and dispersal capacities of four actively dispersing sibling weevil species (Curculio spp.) that exploit the same, highly variable resource (oak acorns). The ability of each species to spread risks over time was estimated from the variability of dormancy duration within cohorts, while their ability to disperse spatially was quantified by flight performance. We show that a first species, C.elephas, which was able to spread risk over time through dormancy, exhibited only medium flight capacities. In contrast, a second species, C.glandium, was able to fly over very long distances, but was hardly capable of spreading risk over time. Surprisingly, the two remaining species (C.venosus and C.pellitus) proved inefficient in spreading risk either in space or in time and seem to exhibit risk avoidance rather than risk-spreading strategy. We conclude that this strong diversification of dispersal-dormancy strategies observed among these four sibling species might contribute to stabilising their coexistence. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.

TI  - Contrasting responses of bee communities to coffee flowering at different spatial scales
PY  - 2006
AB  - While investigating biodiversity patterns on different spatial scales, ecological processes determining these patterns have been rarely analysed. Flower visitation by bees is an important ecological process that is related to floral resource availability. However, little is known about whether responses of bee communities to floral resource availability change at different spatial scales. We studied density and species richness of flower-visiting bees in relation to floral resource availability, provided by coffee, in traditional agroforestry systems on a field, shrub, and branch scale. On a field scale, mean bee density per shrub increased with decreasing proportion of flowering coffee shrubs per site, showing a dilution effect. Conversely, on shrub and branch scales bee density per shrub, or shrub part, increased with increasing number of inflorescences, showing a concentration effect. Additionally, bee density per shrub was higher on those that were only partly, rather than totally surrounded by other flowering coffee shrubs. Species richness of flower-visiting bees was positively affected by high resource availability on a shrub and a branch scale, expressed by a high number of inflorescences, but at the field scale the proportion of flowering shrubs per site did not have any effect on species richness. Our results show contrasting responses of the community of flower-visiting bees to floral resource availability, depending on the spatial scale considered. We conclude that patterns of flower-visiting bee communities of only one spatial scale can not be generalized, since the number of pollinators may be limited on a field scale, but not on smaller scales.

TI  - Testing the resource concentration hypothesis with tarnished plant bug on strawberry: density of hosts and patch size influence the interaction between abundance of nymphs and incidence of damage
PY  - 2003
AB  - . 1. Attributes of patches with strawberry plants were manipulated experimentally to assess the impact of patch size and host density on the abundance of tarnished plant bug (Hemiptera: Miridae) and incidence of fruit damage.



2. The density of nymphs per inflorescence increased with patch size and host density for some but not all generations of plant bug, providing partial support for the resource concentration hypothesis, while emphasising the importance of replicating experiments across several generations of herbivore.



3. Increasing density of nymphs with increasing patch size and host density did not translate into a high incidence of damage, which may be due to the relatively low feeding impact of nymphs in patches with numerous fruits and to the relatively high perimeter-to-area ratio in small patches resulting in a relatively high proportion of damaged fruits.



4. The decreasing proportion of damaged fruits with increasing density of fruits per patch suggests that nymphs exhibit a saturating functional response to density of strawberry fruits. Functional responses of herbivores may be a critical yet overlooked component that influences interactions between insects and their host plant. In particular, concentrated plant resources may result in increased numbers of herbivores yet sill have a negligible influence on plant damage and/or fitness.

TI  - The role of resources and natural enemies in determining the distribution of an insect herbivore population
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary

1. Both resources and natural enemies can influence the distribution of a herbivore. The ideal free distribution predicts that herbivores distribute themselves to optimise utilisation of resources. There is also evidence of herbivores seeking out refuges that reduce natural enemy attack (enemy-free space). Which of these theories predominates in a thistle–tephritid Terellia ruficauda (Diptera: Tephritidae)–parasitoid interaction is examined.



2. The plant, Cirsium palustre, had a contagious distribution approximated by the negative binomial distribution. Terellia ruficauda foraged preferentially and oviposited on isolated plants although its larvae gained neither nutritional benefit nor reduced natural enemy pressure from such behaviour.



3. Parasitoids of T. ruficauda foraged and oviposited more frequently on isolated than on crowded T. ruficauda, resulting in inverse density-dependent parasitoid attack at all spatial scales examined. Neither the herbivore nor natural enemies distributed themselves according to the predictions of the ideal free distribution and the herbivore did not oviposit to reduce natural enemy attack.



4. Extrapolating from the theoretical predictions of the ideal free distribution and enemy-free space to the field requires considerable caution. Terellia ruficauda and its parasitoids appear to select their oviposition sites to spread the risk of losses through factors (e.g. mammal herbivory) that may damage dense clusters of C. palustre.

TI  - Organization of a Plant-Arthropod Association in Simple and Diverse Habitats: The Fauna of Collards (Brassica Oleracea)
PY  - 1973
AB  - Collards were grown at Ithaca, New York, in two experimental habitats: pure stands and single rows that were bounded on each side by diverse, meadow vegetation. The arthropods associated with these plants were sampled on 20 dates over a 3—year period. The status of the herbivore species was measured by their rank in biomass in each sample. The two most prominent species, Phyllotreta cruciferae and Pieris rapae, maintained high status throughout the investigation, but another important species, Brevicoryne brassicae, was absent for an entire season. Pit feeders usually formed the most important herbivore guild. Nevertheless, the guild spectrum, which describes the functional structure of the fauna, varied widely in time and space. The size distributions of species and of individuals were both highly skewed toward the smaller sizes. Herbivore loads, the mean biomass of herbivores per 100 g of consumable foliage, were consistently higher in the pure stands. Moreover, herbivore loads varied significantly with season in each experimental habitat. Both the number of herbivore species and the diversity of the herbivore load were greater in the diverse habitat. Biomass was more heavily concentrated among the prominent herbivores in the pure stands; increased dominance, rather than differences in species richness, appeared to be the major cause for the lower herbivore diversity in this habitat. The diversity of predators and parasitoids was higher in the pure stands. Most of the abundant species found on collards shared a similar narrow range of hosts. As a result the species in this core group of herbivores and parasitoids were regularly associated with each other. Predators and the less abundant herbivores tended to be less specialized and served to link the collard association with the surrounding community. Plant—arthropod associations are representative of component communities, well—integrated systems that form portions of larger compound communities. This distinction facilitates the analysis of community structure. Microclimates and the effectiveness of "enemies" did not appear to differ sufficiently in the two experimental habitats to account for the observed differences in the herbivore load. The results suggest a new proposition, the resource concentration hypothesis, which states that herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands; that the most specialized species frequently attain higher relative densities in simple environments; and that, as a result, biomass tends to become concentrated in a few species, causing a decrease in the diversity of herbivores in pure stands.

TI  - Stem-boring insects of fragmented Calamagrostis habitats : herbivore-parasitoid community structure and the unpredictability of grass shoot abundance
PY  - 1998
AB  - 1. Communities of stem-boring insects attacking the grass Calamagrostis epigeios (L.) Roth were analysed from twenty-five pure stands of C. epigeios differing in area and isolation. Insect communities comprised nine phytophagous and eighteen entomophagous species. Most abundant herbivores (attacking > 1% of all shoots) were Tetramesa eximia (Giraud) (Hym. Eurytomidae), Eurytoma sp. (Hym. Eurytomidae), Lasioptera calamagrostidis (Rubs.) (Dipt. Cecidomyiidae), and Eriopeltis sp. (Hom. Pseudococcidae). About 28% of the twenty-seven species were monophagous, 61% oligophagous (restricted to Poaceae), and 11% polyphagous. Although herbivores generally attacked thick shoots, species-specific differences in the attacked mean diameter were found. 2. The main purpose of this study was to analyse the relative effects of area, isolation and unpredictability of available food resources on the abundance of herbivores, parasitoids and resulting tritrophic effects. Variability of shoot abundance varied greatly between years, and even more between habitats within the same year. On average, shoot density per habitat increased or decreased 2.4-fold between succeeding years. 3. Variability of grass shoot abundance was not related to habitat characteristics such as area, isolation, biomass, shoot density, changes in area or shoot density between years, or shoot features like internode number or diameter, but was negatively influenced by shading of trees. Similarly, habitat area or isolation did not correlate with other habitat features. 4. Grass shoot abundance was the most important predictor of species abundance and attack rate of herbivores. In contrast to expectations, area and isolation of habitats did not explain differences in species richness, and only influenced abundance of three species. In addition, even the experimental removal of all grass shoots (and thereby, of all stem-boring insects) from five habitats in winter did not negatively influence colonization the following year. These results suggest a surprisingly high mobility of this rather specialized community of stem-boring insects that appeared to superimpose on area and isolation effects. Unpredictability of grass shoot abundance was presumably the main selection pressure for the obviously high dispersal abilities of the Calamagrostis insects. 5. Per cent parasitism was mainly influenced by the percentage of attacked shoots. Parasitism of T. eximia by its major parasitoid also correlated with habitat connectivity, emphasizing the hypothesis that a continuum of habitats should be particularly favourable for the third trophic level.

TI  - Biological pest control and yields depend on spatial and temporal crop cover dynamics
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary
Modern agricultural landscapes are dynamic systems with interannually changing proportions of different crop types. However, the effects of spatiotemporal changes in crop area on crop yields and crop–herbivore–antagonist interactions have been rarely considered, in contrast to documented beneficial effects of semi-natural habitats on biological pest control at local and landscape scales. In this study, we examined how the proportion of oilseed rape (OSR) fields in a landscape and the annual increase or decrease in OSR cover due to crop rotation affect OSR herbivores, their natural enemies and crop yield.
During two study years, we examined the abundance of adult and larval pollen beetles, parasitism of pollen beetle larvae by a parasitic ichneumonid and crop yields (seed weight per plant) in the edge and centre of 36 OSR fields. The fields differed in the proportion of OSR in the surrounding landscape at 1-km radius and in the interannual change in the proportion of OSR from the previous year to the respective study year.
Adult pollen beetle abundance decreased in one study year and larval pollen beetle abundance and parasitism rates decreased in both study years with spatially increasing OSR proportion in the landscape, indicating dilution effects on both trophic levels. Crop yield was positively affected by spatially increasing proportions of OSR. An interannual increase in the proportion of OSR led to the dilution of pest species, but had no significant effect on yield or parasitism rate.
Synthesis and applications. The negative effects of pollen beetles on yields despite regular insecticide applications underpin the need for improved techniques for controlling this pest. Our results emphasize the potential to enhance crop yields by the management of spatiotemporal crop cover dynamics within landscapes. We recommend that future management schemes should coordinate the spatial aggregation and annual dynamics of oilseed rape (OSR) cover in a landscape as a potential way to reduce pest impacts in intensively managed OSR fields.

TI  - Prolonged diapause and seed predation by the acorn weevil, Curculio robustus, in relation to masting of the deciduous oak Quercus acutissima
PY  - 2016
AB  - Many researchers have studied the relationship between masting by trees and seed predation by insects. Most of these studies have been plant centered, with little focus on the insect perspective. To estimate the effect of mast seeding on insect seed predators, the life-history traits of these insects must also be considered because some seed insects can survive lean years by prolonged diapause. In this study, I examined larval infestation of acorns and life-history traits of the acorn weevil, Curculio robustus (Roelofs) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in relation to acorn production of the deciduous oak Quercus acutissima Carruthers (Fagaceae) in a coppice stand in central Japan in 2004–2009. Curculio robustus females oviposit into Q. acutissima acorns, inside which the larvae develop. Mature larvae leave acorns and burrow into the soil, where they overwinter. Although germination did occur in acorns infested by weevil larvae, the percentage of germination was lower in acorns damaged by many larvae. Acorn production in Q. acutissima varied considerably among years. Both the number of C. robustus larvae infesting acorns and the percentage of acorns infested were affected by the amount of acorns produced by Q. acutissima, and two successive lean years appeared to have a considerable impact on C. robustus population size. Consequently, only a small fraction of the acorns produced were lost to predation in a mast year after two successive lean years. However, C. robustus could survive the two successive lean years because of prolonged larval diapause, probably leading to a marked decrease in population size. These findings suggest that masting in Q. acutissima succeeds as a predator satiation strategy in response to acorn damage by C. robustus, and that C. robustus has developed prolonged diapause as a counter-adaptation.

TI  - Mutualisms in a changing world: an evolutionary perspective
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1459–1474

Abstract
There is growing concern that rapid environmental degradation threatens mutualistic interactions. Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change.

TI  - The ghost of granivory past
PY  - 2001
AB  - We report a 36-month echo of vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) seed-selection in the composition of synthetic forb communities in Wisconsin. An initial study showed direct suppression of an exceptionally large-seeded (seed > 15 mg) species (Silphium integrifolium, Asteraceae) by seed-size predation by rodents during the winter, resulting in indirect release of small-seeded (seed £ 1.5 mg) species. Twelve months after planting, plant diversities (Simpson’s D) were 33% higher in plots exposed to winter seed selection by rodents. Thirty-six months after planting, Silphium integrifolium had almost equalized densities in rodent access (20.8 a 4.1 m ‐2 ) and exclusion (29.0 a 5.2 m ‐2 ) plots, but still suppressed both large-seeded (‡ 3.5 mg) and small-seeded (£ 1.5 mg) species (F1,16a 11.84 and F1,16a 10.42, P £ 0.005, respectively). A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) distinguished effects of Silphium integrifolium (Wilk’s lambda Pa 0.029) from echoes of earlier winter granivory (Wilk’s lambda Pa 0.014). Thirty months after rodent exclusion, diversity (D) remained 27% higher in plots once opened to winter granivory (adjusted mean 4.70 a 0.37 SE) as compared with closed plots (3.70 a 0.26; F1,16a 5.12, P < 0.05). Echoes of earlier granivory remained after rodentinduced imbalances in the abundances of the competitive driver of this system, Silphium integrifolium, all but disappeared.

TI  - Global change and species interactions in terrestrial ecosystems.
PY  - 2008
AB  - The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.

TI  - Rodents change acorn dispersal behaviour in response to ungulate presence
PY  - 2007
AB  - Small rodents are prominent seed predators, but they also favour plant recruitment as seed dispersers. The direct interactions of ungulates on plants are more one-sided and negative, as they mainly reduce plant recruitment through predation on seeds and seedlings. The effects of small rodents and ungulates on plant recruitment have been considered and studied as independent episodes within plant regeneration cycles. However, ungulate-rodent interactions and their potential effects on plant regeneration have not been considered so far. A number of studies have recently documented ungulate effects on the abundance, diversity and spatial distribution of small rodents. Here, we hypothesize that ungulates may also affect rodent seed dispersal behaviour. We monitored acorn dispersal by small rodents (Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) in oak woodlands with and without exclosures for large ungulates, mainly red deer, Cervus elaphus, and wild boar, Sus scrofa. The study was carried out in a typical Mediterranean Holm oak, Quercus ilex, forest throughout the acorn fall season in 2003 and 2004. We found that, in both years, the proportion of acorns cached and not recovered in the short-term was, on average, lower in the presence (1.4%) than in the absence (19.9%) of ungulates. Acorn dispersal distances were not affected by ungulate presence in either year. However, ungulates had an effect on the spatial distribution of dispersed seeds; rodents apparently avoided shrubs as caching sites in both years. This result was interpreted as a behavioural response to reduce the risk of cache pilferage by conspecifics, which are closely associated with shrubs in presence, but not in absence, of ungulates. Potential effects of different densities of rodents or predators were discarded, as none of them differed between the areas with and without ungulates. The present study found significant interactions between heterospecific seed and seedling consumers that had been considered as independent episodes within tree regeneration cycles. As a result of such interactions, ungulates may have negative indirect effects on oak recruitment by reducing (1) acorn caching frequency, and (2) the proportion of acorns cached under shrubs, key nurse-plants for the establishment of Holm oak seedlings in Mediterranean areas.

TI  - Forestry Matters: Decline of Oaks Will Impact Wildlife in Hardwood Forests
PY  - 2007
AB  - Acorn production by oaks (Quercus spp.) is an important food resource for wildlife in many deciduous forests. Its role as a hard mast crop that can be either stored or used to build fat reserves for winter survival cannot be replaced by most other potential foods. Changes in forest management, introduced pests and pathogens, and increased deer populations have resulted in significant changes in the demography of oaks in eastern North America, as evident in Forest Inventory and Analysis data. Specifically, maples (Acer spp.) are replacing oaks in many forests through dominance of the younger age classes. These changes are not yet obvious in mast production but will take decades to reverse. Effective forest management for mast production is arguably one of the more important tasks facing wildlife professionals, yet receives scant attention by both public and private land managers. Public forests need to explicitly include mast production in their forest planning and reduce adversarial relationships over forest management. Market forces are driving commercial forests toward forest certification. Private forests compose 80% of our oak forests and are the hardest group to influence. States have not been able to effectively market forest plans and we recommend joining with advocacy groups more adept at motivating the public. Increased communication between wildlife and forestry professionals is needed through agency restructuring and joint meetings of professional agencies at the state level. Professional wildlife and forest managers are encouraged to make increased use of monitoring data and form a multiagency cooperative using a joint venture model, which has been successful for other organizations.

TI  - Post‐dispersal seed recovery by animals: is it a plant‐ or an animal‐driven process?
PY  - 2015
AB  - The ability of animals to find and consume hoarded seeds (i.e. seed recovery) is a key stage within the seed dispersal process. However, the ecology of seed recovery is still poorly understood. Here, we analyze the factors controlling seed recovery by scatter-hoarding rodents in an oak-dominated temperate forest. We examined the relative importance of intrinsic seed traits (i.e. plant-driven) and extrinsic seed factors (i.e. animal-driven) on the probability of seed recovery. We found that seed recovery is mainly driven by extrinsic seed factors, mostly related to animal behavior (pilfering frequency, microsite preference, predation risk, burial depth and cache size). Important intrinsic traits such as seed size, seed quality and seed-drop timing were, on average, of lower significance in the probability of seed recovery (2.8-times less important than extrinsic factors); only seed quality was an important intrinsic trait. On the other hand, larger and nutritionally more valuable seeds showed a removal–recovery tradeoff as they enhance seed removal and hoarding (increasing dispersal quality) but also favour seed recovery (increasing predation). We find that other mechanisms beyond seed traits (e.g. masting) are needed to decrease seed recovery and, thus, increase seed survival. We conclude that, as seed recovery is mostly driven by animal behavioural factors, it substantially differs from other previous stages of the seed dispersal process that are more dependent on seed traits. We argue that seed recovery needs further attention to advance our understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal and the role of secondary dispersers as a selective force for seeds.

AB  - We analyzed seed production of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest along an elevational gradient in New Zealand from 1020 to 1370 m (treeline) for the years 1973-2002. We used seed production data from nine elevations and a site- and species-specific net carbon (C) availability model from two elevations (1050 m and 1340 m) to examine how three variables (temperature, soil moisture, and net C avail- ability) during three key periods (resource priming, flowering primordia development, and flowering) influence seed production. These three strongly interrelated variables have all been considered determinants of seed production but have not previously been tested to- gether in a single analysis. Seed production increased over the 30-year period, with the greatest increases at high elevations; this increase was driven by a greater frequency of intermediate-sized seeding years. We then determined how temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability determined seeding, and examined whether temporal trends in the seeding data could be linked to similar temporal trends in temperature, soil moisture, or net C availability. High seed production was related to cool summers with high soil moisture during resource priming, warm summers during flower primordia development, and low net C availability during flowering. Positive temporal trends in temperatures during the period of flower primordia development accounted for the increase in seed production, suggesting that increasing temperatures are promoting more frequent seed production at high elevations.

TI  - Intra- and interspecific tree growth across a long altitudinal gradient in the Peruvian Andes.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Tree growth response across environmental gradients is fundamental to understanding species distributional ecology and forest ecosystem ecology and to predict future ecosystem services. Cross-sectional patterns of ecosystem properties with respect to climatic gradients are often used to predict ecosystem responses to global change. Across sites in the tropics, primary productivity increases with temperature, suggesting that forest ecosystems will become more productive as temperature rises. However, this trend is confounded with a shift in species composition and so may not reflect the response of in situ forests to warming. In this study, we simultaneously studied tree diameter growth across the altitudinal ranges of species within a single genus across a geographically compact temperature gradient, to separate the direct effect of temperature on tree growth from that of species compositional turnover. Using a Bayesian state space modeling framework we combined data from repeated diameter censuses and dendrometer measurements from across a 1700-m altitudinal gradient collected over six years on over 2400 trees in Weinmannia, a dominant and widespread genus of cloud forest trees in the Andes. Within species, growth showed no consistent trend with altitude, but higher-elevation species had lower growth rates than lower-elevation species, suggesting that species turnover is largely responsible for the positive correlation between productivity and temperature in tropical forests. Our results may indicate a significant difference in how low- and high-latitude forests will respond to climate change, since temperate and boreal tree species are consistently observed to have a positive relationship between growth and temperature. If our results hold for other tropical species, a positive response in ecosystem productivity to increasing temperatures in the Andes will depend on the altitudinal migration of tree species. The rapid pace of climate change, and slow observed rates of migration, suggest a slow, or even initially negative response of ecosystem productivity to warming. Finally, this study shows how the observed scale of biological organization can affect conclusions drawn from studies of ecological phenomena across environmental gradients, and calls into question the common practice in tropical ecology of lumping species at higher taxonomic levels.

TI  - Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests
PY  - 2008
AB  - The world's forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.

TI  - Seed removal in two coexisting oak species: ecological consequences of seed size, plant cover and seed-drop timing
PY  - 2008
AB  - Seed predation and dispersal can critically influence plant community structure and dynamics. Inter-specific differences arising at these early stages play a crucial role on tree recruitment patterns, which in turn could influence forest dynamics and species segregation in heterogeneous environments such as Mediterranean forests. We investigated removal rates from acorns set onto the ground in two coexisting Mediterranean oak speciesQuercus canariensis and Q. suberin southern Spain. We developed maximum likelihood estimators to investigate the main factors controlling probabilities of seed removal and to describe species-specific functional responses. To account for inter-specific differences in seed-drop timing, two experiments were established: a simultaneous exposure of acorns of the two species (synchronous experiments) and a seed exposure following their natural seed-drop phenology (diachronic experiments). A total of 1536 acorns were experimentally distributed along a wide and natural gradient of plant cover, and removal was periodically monitored for three months at two consecutive years (with contrasting differences in seed production and thus seed availability on the ground). The probability of seed removal increased with plant cover (leaf area index, LAI) for the two oak species. Inter-specific differences in acorn removal were higher in open areas and disappeared in closed microhabitats, especially during a non-mast year. Despite later seed-drop, Q. suber acorns were removed faster and at a higher proportion than those of Q. canariensis. The higher probability of seed removal for this species could be attributed to its larger seed size compared to Q. canariensis, as inter-specific differences were less pronounced when similar sized acorns were exposed. Inter-specific differences in seed removal, arising from seed size variability and microsite heterogeneity, could be of paramount importance in oak species niche separation, driving stand dynamics and composition along environmental gradients.

TI  - Context-dependent seed dispersal by a scatter-hoarding corvid
PY  - 2016
AB  - Corvids (crows, jays, magpies and nutcrackers) are important dispersers of large-seeded plants. Studies on captive or supplemented birds suggest that they flexibly adjust their scatter-hoarding behaviour to the context of social dynamics and relative seed availability. Because many corvid-dispersed trees show high annual variation in seed production, context-dependent foraging can have strong effects on natural corvid scatter-hoarding behaviour. We investigated how seed availability and social dynamics affected scatter-hoarding in the island scrub jays (Aphelocoma insularis). We quantified rates of scatter-hoarding behaviour and territorial defence of 26 colour-marked birds over a three-year period with variable acorn crops. We tested whether caching parameters were correlated with variation in annual seed production of oaks as predicted by the predator dispersal hypothesis, which states that caching rates and distances should vary with seed abundance in ways that benefit tree fitness. We also tested whether antagonistic interactions with conspecifics would affect scatter-hoarding adversely, as found in experimental studies. Caching behaviour varied with acorn availability. Caching distances correlated positively with annual acorn crop size, increasing by as much as 40% between years. Caching rates declined over time in years with small acorn crops, but increased when crops were large. Acorn foraging and caching rates were also negatively correlated with rates of territorial aggression. Overall foraging rates, however, were not associated with aggression, suggesting that reduced dispersal rates were not simply due to time constraints. Our field results support laboratory findings that caching rates and distances by scatter-hoarding corvids are context-dependent. Furthermore, our results are consistent with predictions of the predator dispersal hypothesis and suggest that large seed crops and social interactions among scatter-hoarders affect dispersal benefits for oaks and other masting tree species.

TI  - DETERMINANTS OF SEED REMOVAL DISTANCE BY SCATTER-HOARDING RODENTS IN DECIDUOUS FORESTS
PY  - 2007
AB  - Scatter-hoarding rodents should space food caches to maximize cache recovery rate (to minimize loss to pilferers) relative to the energetic cost of carrying food items greater distances. Optimization models of cache spacing make two predictions. First, spacing of caches should be greater for food items with greater energy content. Second, the mean distance between caches should increase with food abundance. However, the latter prediction fails to account for the effect of food abundance on the behavior of potential pilferers or on the ability of caching individuals to acquire food by means other than recovering their own caches. When considering these factors, shorter cache distances may be predicted in conditions of higher food abundance. We predicted that seed caching distances would be greater for food items of higher energy content and during lower ambient food abundance and that the effect of seed type on cache distance variation would be lower during higher food abundance. We recorded distances moved for 8636 seeds of five seed types at 15 locations in three forested sites in Pennsylvania, USA, and 29 forest fragments in Indiana, USA, across five different years. Seed production was poor in three years and high in two years. Consistent with previous studies, seeds with greater energy content were moved farther than less profitable food items. Seeds were dispersed less far in seed-rich years than in seed-poor years, contrary to predictions of conventional models. Interactions were important, with seed type effects more evident in seed-poor years. These results suggest that, when food is superabundant, optimal cache distances are more strongly determined by minimizing energy cost of caching than by minimizing pilfering rates and that cache loss rates may be more strongly density-dependent in times of low seed abundance.

TI  - Conspecific negative density dependence and forest diversity.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Conspecific negative density-dependent establishment, in which local abundance negatively affects establishment of conspecific seedlings through host-specific enemies, can influence species diversity of plant communities, but the generality of this process is not well understood. We tested the strength of density dependence using the United States Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database containing 151 species from more than 200,000 forest plots spanning 4,000,000 square kilometers. We found that most species experienced conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), but there was little effect of heterospecific density. Additionally, abundant species exhibited weaker CNDD than rarer species, and species-rich regions exhibited stronger CNDD than species-poor regions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that CNDD is a pervasive mechanism driving diversity across a gradient from boreal to subtropical forests.

TI  - Resource depletion, pollen coupling, and the ecology of mast seeding.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Masting, the highly variable and synchronous production of seeds across a population of perennial plants, is an ecologically important, but still poorly understood, phenomenon. While much is known about the fitness benefits of masting and its effects on seed consumers and trophic interactions, less is understood about the proximate mechanisms of masting. The resource budget model (RBM) posits that masting requires more resources than plants can gain in a single year. Individual plants store resources until a threshold is reached and then produce seeds, which depletes resources so that plants cannot reproduce again for 2 or more years. Individuals are synchronized by pollen coupling or environmental forcing. We review the assumptions of these models and assess the extent to which they are consistent with general patterns in plant populations. We discuss the implications of the RBM for how plants respond to changes in the external environment. Overall, the RBM is a likely cause of synchrony in many, but not all, masting species. This mechanistic hypothesis also leads to specific, but not always intuitive, expectations about how plant resources affect mast seeding.

AB  - Human alteration of Earth is substantial and growing. Between one-third and one-half of the land surface has been transformed by human action; the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has increased by nearly 30 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution; more atmospheric nitrogen is fixed by humanity than by all natural terrestrial sources combined; more than half of all accessible surface fresh water is put to use by humanity; and about one-quarter of the bird species on Earth have been driven to extinction. By these and other standards, it is clear that we live on a human-dominated planet.

TI  - Out Of The Quagmire Of Plant Defense Hypotheses
PY  - 2003
AB  - ABSTRACT Several hypotheses, mainly Optimal Defense (OD), Carbon:Nutrient Balance (CNB), Growth Rate (GR), and Growth‐Differentiation Balance (GDB), have individually served as frameworks for investigating the patterns of plant defense against herbivores, in particular the pattern of constitutive defense. The predictions and tests of these hypotheses have been problematic for a variety of reasons and have led to considerable confusion about the state of the “theory of plant defense.” The primary contribution of the OD hypothesis is that it has served as the main framework for investigation of genotypic expression of plant defense, with the emphasis on allocation cost of defense. The primary contribution of the CNB hypothesis is that it has served as the main framework for investigation of how resources affect phenotypic expression of plant defense, often with studies concerned about allocation cost of defense. The primary contribution of the GR hypothesis is that it explains how intrinsic growth rate of p...

TI  - Transformation of the Nitrogen Cycle: Recent Trends, Questions, and Potential Solutions
PY  - 2008
AB  - Humans continue to transform the global nitrogen cycle at a record pace, reflecting an increased combustion of fossil fuels, growing demand for nitrogen in agriculture and industry, and pervasive inefficiencies in its use. Much anthropogenic nitrogen is lost to air, water, and land to cause a cascade of environmental and human health problems. Simultaneously, food production in some parts of the world is nitrogen-deficient, highlighting inequities in the distribution of nitrogen-containing fertilizers. Optimizing the need for a key human resource while minimizing its negative consequences requires an integrated interdisciplinary approach and the development of strategies to decrease nitrogen-containing waste.

TI  - Mast species composition alters seed fate in North American rodent-dispersed hardwoods
PY  - 2014
AB  - Interactions between plants and scatter-hoarding animals may shift from mutualism to predation as a function of the resources available to those animals. Because seed species differ in their nutrient content and defenses to predation, resource selection and cache management by scatter-hoarders, and thus seed fate, may also depend on the relative availability of different seed types. We tracked the fates of tagged Castanea dentata, Quercus alba, and Q. rubra seeds presented to rodents in pairwise combinations and found that C. dentata, which has moderate dormancy prior to germination, survived better in the presence of Q. alba (no dormancy) than with Q. rubra (longer dormancy). Decisions made by scatter-hoarders in response to the composition of available seed resources can alter the relationship between masting and seed dispersal effectiveness in individual tree species and may have influenced the evolution of asynchrony among species-specific masting patterns in temperate forests. In theory, preferential allocation of certain seed species to storage or consumption could also result in indirect apparent predation by one seed species on another.

PY  - 2006
AB  - 2 circular sub-plots in each sample plot, for a total of 140 1-m 2 sub-plots. Sampling was carried out in mid-July of 1991 and repeated at approximately the same time in 1992. In 1994, these same plots were sampled each month from May to October. Seasonal patterns of herb layer dynamics were assessed for the complete 1994 data set, whereas inter-annual variability was based on plot data from 1991, 1992, and the July sample of 1994. There were no significant differences between watersheds for any sample year for any of the other herb layer characteristics measured, including herb layer cover, species richness, evenness, and diversity. Cover on WS4 decreased significantly from 1991 to 1992, followed by no change to 1994. By contrast, herb layer cover did not vary significantly across years on WS3. Cover of the herbaceous layer of both watersheds increased from early in the growing season to the middle of the growing season, decreasing thereafter, with no significant differences between WS3 and WS4 for any of the monthly cover means in 1994. Similar seasonal patterns found for herb layer cover—and lack of significant differences between watersheds—were also evident for species diversity and richness. By contrast, there was little seasonal change in herb layer species evenness, which was nearly identical between watersheds for all months except October. Seasonal patterns for individual species/species groups were closely similar between watersheds, especially for Viola rotundifolia and Viola spp. Species richness and species diversity were linearly related to herb layer cover for both WS3 and WS4, suggesting that spatial and temporal increases in cover were more related to recruitment of herb layer species than to growth of existing species. Results of this study indicate that there have been negligible responses of the herb layer to 6 yr of N additions to WS3.

TI  - Evolutionary interactions between tree squirrels and trees : A review and synthesis
PY  - 2008
AB  - Tree squirrels, by virtue of their arboreal niches, granivorous (or herbivorous) feeding habits, and long, relatively unchanged history have shared a close evolutionary relationship with many of the woody plants on which they feed. As such, many tree and flying squirrels may be keystone consumers that serve as indicators of the stability of forested ecosystems. Herein, I review the evidence for evolutionary interactions between squirrels and seed trees, and provide a brief overview of the general ways in which the two influence each other's evolutionary history. I review three systems in which detailed studies have demonstrated strong evolutionary interactions between squirrels and trees: one in which squirrels act primarily as seed predators, another as herbivores, and a third in which squirrels act as both seed predators and dispersal agents. I show the detailed methodology required to uncover such interactions and the potential implications of these studies.

TI  - What drives masting? The phenological synchrony hypothesis
PY  - 2015
AB  - Annually variable and synchronous seed production, or masting behavior, is a widespread phenomenon with dramatic effects on wildlife populations and their associated communities. Proximally, masting is often correlated with environmental factors and most likely involves differential pollination success and resource allocation, but little is known about how these factors interact or how they influence seed production. We studied masting in the valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee), a California endemic tree, and report evidence that phenological synchrony in flowering driven by microclimatic variability determines the size of the acorn crop through its effects on pollen availability and fertilization success. These findings integrate two of the major factors believed to influence seed production in wind-pollinated species—environmental conditions and pollen limitation—by means of a coherent mechanistic hypothesis for how highly variable and synchronized annual seed production is accomplished. We illustrate how, by means of a simulation based on the mechanism proposed here, climate change may influence masting patterns through its effects on environmental variability.

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF MAMMALIAN ACORN PREDATORS ON RED OAK ACORN SURVIVAL AND GERMINATION
PY  - 2005
AB  - A decline in the dominance of oaks (Quercus) in eastern deciduous forests generally has been attributed to herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) or fire suppression, but few studies have considered a role for mammalian consumers of acorns. We used acorns placed on the soil surface and acorns buried approximately 2 cm underground in 4 types of exclosures to evaluate the effects of white-tailed deer, tree squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis and S. niger), and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) on survival and germination of red oak (Q. rubra) acorns. Buried acorns were intended to mimic caches of squirrels. When deer were excluded from a plot, squirrels and mice consumed or removed all surface acorns. When both deer and squirrels were excluded from a plot, mice consumed .90% of the acorns on the surface. Thus, acorn consumption by deer is unlikely to be a causal factor in the widespread decline of many oak species. Survival of buried acorns did not differ between open plots and plots where only squirrels and mice had access, but when squirrels were excluded from a plot, the survival of buried acorns increased. In addition, buried acorns germinated at a much higher rate than acorns on the surface. As suggested for many oak species, unrecovered caches of acorns are likely a critical source of red oak seedlings.

Although most temperate forests are actively managed for timber production, few data exist regarding the long-term effects of forest management on understory plant communities. We investigated the responses of understory communities to a factorial com- bination of silvicultural-thinning and nutrient-addition treatments maintained for 12-16 yr in a set of 21-27 yr old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plantations. The four thinning levels span those used operationally (final stem densities of 494-1680 trees/ha); the two fertilization levels included a control and N addition in the form of urea at ;60 kg N·ha 21 ·yr 21 , about twice the dosage used operationally. Understory vegetation cover showed significant effects of thinning, with the highest thinning level resulting in the highest observed cover values. However, in some cases low levels of thinning resulted in a reduction in understory cover compared to unthinned con- trols. Understory vegetation declined dramatically in response to urea fertilization, with up to a 10-fold drop in herb-layer cover in unthinned stands. Species richness showed a simpler response to treatments, increasing in response to thinning, but decreasing in response to fertilization. Examination of species-area relationships indicated that effects of thinning and fertilization on species richness were similar across the range of spatial scales examined. Tree canopy cover, assessed by means of hemispherical photograph analysis, increased with fertilization, and estimated understory light levels decreased with fertilization, but neither showed a significant response to thinning at the time of measurement (12-16 yr after tree removal). Thus, treatment effects on understory cover and species richness were not a simple function of canopy cover or estimated light availability. Rather, there was a weak positive relationship between estimated understory light flux and vascular plant cover and diversity in nonfertilized plots, and no such relationship in fertilized plots. The lack of correspondence between treatment effects on canopy cover and understory vegetation may be due to time lags in understory response to changes in canopy cover or to treatment effects not mediated by light availability, such as physical disturbance during thinning operations and toxicity responses following application of urea fertilizer. Species-specific responses to treatments were in part predictable as a function of plant life-form and edaphic association: species affinity for high soil moisture was the best predictor of fertilization responses, while life-form was the best predictor of thinning responses, with ferns and graminoids showing the largest positive responses to thinning. The successional status and stature of understory plant species were not significantly related to treatment responses. In sum, our results indicate that silvicultural thinning and fertilization can have large effects on understory plant diversity and community composition. However, such effects were not a simple function of understory light levels, and conventional ''functional types'' were of only limited value in predicting species-specific responses to silvicultural treatments.

TI  - Coexistence of insect species competing for a pulsed resource: toward a unified theory of biodiversity in fluctuating environments.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background 
One major challenge in understanding how biodiversity is organized is finding out whether communities of competing species are shaped exclusively by species-level differences in ecological traits (niche theory), exclusively by random processes (neutral theory of biodiversity), or by both processes simultaneously. Communities of species competing for a pulsed resource are a suitable system for testing these theories: due to marked fluctuations in resource availability, the theories yield very different predictions about the timing of resource use and the synchronization of the population dynamics between the competing species. Accordingly, we explored mechanisms that might promote the local coexistence of phytophagous insects (four sister species of the genus Curculio) competing for oak acorns, a pulsed resource.


Methodology/Principal Findings 
We analyzed the time partitioning of the exploitation of oak acorns by the four weevil species in two independent communities, and we assessed the level of synchronization in their population dynamics. In accordance with the niche theory, overall these species exhibited marked time partitioning of resource use, both within a given year and between different years owing to different dormancy strategies between species, as well as distinct demographic patterns. Two of the four weevil species, however, consistently exploited the resource during the same period of the year, exhibited a similar dormancy pattern, and did not show any significant difference in their population dynamics.


Conclusions/Significance 
The marked time partitioning of the resource use appears as a keystone of the coexistence of these competing insect species, except for two of them which are demographically nearly equivalent. Communities of consumers of pulsed resources thus seem to offer a promising avenue for developing a unifying theory of biodiversity in fluctuating environments which might predict the co-occurrence, within the same community, of species that are ecologically either very similar, or very different.

TI  - Nitrogen availability influences regeneration of temperate tree species in the understory seedling bank
PY  - 2002
AB  - While we have a good mechanistic understanding of effects of light avail- ability on tree seedling regeneration in forests, we know little of the processes controlling seedling responses to changes in nutrient availability in the understory (low light). To examine how nitrogen availability may influence patterns of seedling regeneration in mixed temperate forests in eastern North America, we investigated nitrogen impacts on the dy- namics of both coniferous and broad-leaved tree species in the understory. In addition, we compared these regeneration responses across coniferous (eastern hemlock) and broad- leaved (red oak) stand types. We applied nitrogen (0, 2.5, or 7.5 g-m-12yr-1) to replicated understory plots in three hemlock and three red oak dominated stands, and examined seedling survival and growth for three coniferous and three broad-leaved species over two years. Nitrogen addition influenced different demographic stages in contrasting ways, lead- ing to a complex series of seedling responses to increased nitrogen availability in the understory. Hemlock was the only species to show a positive survival response to nitrogen addition, and these effects only became apparent after the first growing season. In contrast, a suite of midsuccessional species (red maple, white pine, and red spruce) underwent nitrogen-induced declines in survival, particularly at early stages of regeneration. Both successional position and species' habitat preferences emerged as better determinants of species' responses to nitrogen deposition in the understory than did leaf habit (coniferous vs. broad-leaved). Effects were often, but not always, more marked in hemlock stands (characterized by very low light availability), suggesting nitrogen-induced declines in seed- ling abundance were likely due to an imbalance between above- and belowground resources. In the present study, we have clearly demonstrated that nitrogen availability can be an important determinant of understory seedling bank dynamics in mixed temperate forests in eastern North America. Nitrogen-induced changes in seedling performance in the un- derstory will ultimately influence the spatial and temporal patterns of regeneration of these mixed forests.

TI  - How plants manipulate the scatter-hoarding behaviour of seed-dispersing animals
PY  - 2010
AB  - Some plants that are dispersed by scatter-hoarding animals appear to have evolved the ability to manipulate the behaviour of those animals to increase the likelihood that seeds and nuts will be stored and that a portion of those items will not be recovered. Plants have achieved this in at least four ways. First, by producing large, nutritious seeds and nuts that are attractive to animals and that stimulate hoarding behaviour. Second, by imposing handling costs that cause animals to hoard rather than to eat items immediately. These handling costs can take one of two forms: physical barriers (e.g. hard seed coats) that take time to remove and secondary chemicals (e.g. tannins) that impose metabolic costs. Third, by masting, where a population of plants synchronizes reproductive effort, producing large nut crops at intervals of several years. Mast crops not only satiate seed predators, but also increase the amount of seed dispersal because scatter-hoarding animals are not easily satiated during caching (causing animals to store more food than they can consume) but are satiated during cache recovery. And fourth, by producing seeds that do not emit strong odours so that buried seeds are less likely to be discovered. These, and perhaps other, traits have increased the relative success of plant species with seeds dispersed by scatter-hoarding animals.

TI  - Thieving rodents as substitute dispersers of megafaunal seeds
PY  - 2012
AB  - The Neotropics have many plant species that seem to be adapted for seed dispersal by megafauna that went extinct in the late Pleistocene. Given the crucial importance of seed dispersal for plant persistence, it remains a mystery how these plants have survived more than 10,000 y without their mutualist dispersers. Here we present support for the hypothesis that secondary seed dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents has facilitated the persistence of these large-seeded species. We used miniature radio transmitters to track the dispersal of reputedly megafaunal seeds by Central American agoutis, which scatter-hoard seeds in shallow caches in the soil throughout the forest. We found that seeds were initially cached at mostly short distances and then quickly dug up again. However, rather than eating the recovered seeds, agoutis continued to move and recache the seeds, up to 36 times. Agoutis dispersed an estimated 35% of seeds for >100 m. An estimated 14% of the cached seeds survived to the next year, when a new fruit crop became available to the rodents. Serial video-monitoring of cached seeds revealed that the stepwise dispersal was caused by agoutis repeatedly stealing and recaching each other’s buried seeds. Although previous studies suggest that rodents are poor dispersers, we demonstrate that communities of rodents can in fact provide highly effective long-distance seed dispersal. Our findings suggest that thieving scatter-hoarding rodents could substitute for extinct megafaunal seed dispersers of tropical large-seeded trees.

AB  - This article describes ways in which excess nitrogen from fossil fuel combustion may stress the biosphere. Nitrogen emissions can have a direct effect on air quality through both the oxidizing potential of nitrogen oxides and the role these compounds play in the formation of ozone. The complexity of these effects on water quality and on forest nutrition is discussed.

TI  - Selection of mast by granivorous rodents of the central hardwood forest region
PY  - 2000
AB  - We used cafeteria-style feeding trials with 8 types of mast in various combinations to examine differences in resource selection among 5 syntopic species of granivorous forest rodents in west-central Indiana. Patterns of resource selection corresponded to differences in phylogeny and body size of granivores, with greatest similarities among closely related species of similar body size. Breadth of resource use varied inversely with body size in our trials. Resource selection by Sciurus carolinensis, S. niger, and Tamiasciurus hudsonicus was correlated positively with caloric and lipid content of mast and its size, whereas selection by Glaucomys volans was correlated negatively with the percentage of protective tissue associated with seeds. Laboratory trials indicated that T. hudsonicus and G. volans discriminate among mast of comparable physical and chemical composition on the basis of size, with a preference for larger seeds. Contrary to our expectations, T. hudsonicus, a recent immigrant from the boreal forest, did not exhibit a preference for seeds of red pine (Pinus resinosa) relative to mast of hardwood species. G. volans and Peromyscus leucopus tended to consume perishable white oak acorns immediately and to cache a substantial portion of less perishable seeds of nonpreferred species. Our results demonstrate the potential for considerable overlap in resource use among members of this guild. Guild members also seem to be affected differentially by physical and chemical properties of mast, and patterns of resource selection reflect contrasting foraging constraints under which these animals operate.

TI  - Plant defenses as complementary resources : a test with squirrels
PY  - 1998
AB  - Generalist herbivores often grow better on mixed diets suggesting that resource types are complementary. We use a consumer-resource framework to develop criteria by which nutritional relationships among foods can be determined from a forager's patch use behavior. Two resources are complementary when at least one yields diminishing returns or the resources interact beneficially with each other. These sufficient conditions may arise when food types contain different plant secondary compounds. We tested for complementarity using fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) and gray squirrels (S. carolinensis) feeding on sunflower seeds treated with tannic or oxalic acid. We used giving-up densities on these two foods in experimental food patches to assay the deterrent effect of each toxin, and to determine whether squirrels treat the toxins as complementary. Squirrels had their highest giving-up densities on oxalate-treated seeds and their lowest on water-treated (control) seeds. Augmenting with oxalate-treated seeds resulted in an increased giving-up density on oxalate-treated seeds relative to tannin-treated seeds. The data suggest that 1) oxalates strongly deter and tannins mildly deter feeding by squirrels, 2) foods containing oxalates or tannins are complementary, and 3) the complementarity of foods containing the two toxins is due primarily to the effect of oxalates. The marginal toxicity of oxalates increases with dose. while that of tannin does not seem to increase with dose.

TI  - Seedling survival in a northern temperate forest understory is increased by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and atmospheric nitrogen deposition
PY  - 2006
AB  - We tested the main and interactive effects of elevated carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]), nitrogen (N), and light availability on leaf photosynthesis, and plant growth and survival in understory seedlings grown in an N-limited northern hardwood forest. For two growing seasons, we exposed six species of tree seedlings (Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides, Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, Pinus strobus, and Prunus serotina )t o a factorial combination of atmospheric CO2 (ambient, and elevated CO2 at 658lmolCO2mol � 1 ) and N deposition (ambient and ambient 130kgNha � 1 yr � 1 )i n open-top chambers placed in an understory light gradient. Elevated CO2 exposure significantly increased apparent quantum efficiency of electron transport by 41% (Po0.0001), light-limited photosynthesis by 47% (Po0.0001), and light-saturated photosynthesis by 60% (Po0.003) compared with seedlings grown in ambient [CO2]. Experimental N deposition significantly increased light-limited photosynthesis as light availability increased (Po0.037). Species differed in the magnitude of light-saturated photosynthetic response to elevated N and light treatments (Po0.016). Elevated CO2 exposure and high N availability did not affect seedling growth; however, growth increased slightly with light availability (R 2 50.26, Po0.0001). Experimental N deposition significantly increased average survival of all species by 48% (Po0.012). However, seedling survival was greatest (85%) under conditions of both high [CO2] and N deposition (Po0.009). Path analysis determined that the greatest predictor for seedling survival in the understory was total biomass (R 2 50.39, Po0.001), and that carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) was a better predictor for seedling growth and survival than maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax). Our results suggest that increasing [CO2] and N deposition from fossil fuel combustion could alter understory tree species recruitment dynamics through changes in seedling survival, and this has the potential to alter future forest species composition.

TI  - Climate cues and resources interact to determine seed production by a masting species
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary


1. Mast seeding is the intermittent production of large quantities of seed across a perennial plant population. Such seeding events in many plant species are initiated by climatic cues, but whether these cues act solely as triggers or also via alterations to nutrient availability is unclear.



2. Here, we examine the effect of nitrogenous fertilization on the relationship between seed production in Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides and two climatic cues (rainfall and temperature) at specific stages in reproductive development from 1999 to 2008.



3. Foliar nitrogen concentrations were positively correlated with rainfall among years, suggesting rainfall was affecting nitrogen availability.



4. Seedfall mass in unfertilized stands was predominantly determined by rainfall during resource priming, while seed production in fertilized stands was more affected by temperature during floral primordia development. Similarly, seedfall mass in older stands, which contain greater internal nutrient reserves, was predominantly determined by temperature.



5. Synthesis. The results of this study demonstrate that the sensitivity of seed production to climatic cues can be altered by manipulation of resource availability and therefore establish that climatic cues involved in the synchronization of mast seeding can influence reproductive effort via an effect on resource availability. These results also indicate that alterations to resource availability have the potential to alter inter-annual patterns of seed production, but further study is required to verify this finding.

TI  - Postdispersal seed predation limits the abundance of a long-lived perennial forb (Lithospermum ruderale)
PY  - 2012
AB  - Loss of seeds to consumers is common in plant communities, but the degree to which these losses influence plant abundance or population growth is often unclear. This is particularly the case for postdispersal seed predation by rodents, as most studies of rodent seed predation have focused on the sources of spatiotemporal variation in seed loss but not quantified the population consequences of this loss. In previous work we showed that seed predation by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) substantially reduced seedling recruitment and establishment of Lithospermum ruderale (Boraginaceae), a long-lived perennial forb. To shed light on how rodent seed predation and the near-term effects on plant recruitment might influence longer-term patterns of L. ruderale population growth, we combined experimental results with demographic data in stage-based population models. Model outputs revealed that rodent seed predation had a significant impact on L. ruderale population growth rate (λ). With the removal of postdispe...

TI  - Dissecting the decision making process of scatter-hoarding rodents
PY  - 2012
AB  - Many animals scatter-hoard seeds to ensure an even supply of food throughout the year and this behavior requires similar foraging decisions. Seed-traits have been shown to affect the final foraging decision but little is known about the decision process itself. Here, we first defined four sequential steps comprising the decision process of scatter-hoarding rodents: 1) upon encountering a seed, should it be ignored or manipulated; 2) if manipulated, should it be eaten in situ or removed elsewhere; 3) upon removal, how far away should it be carried; and finally 4) whether to eat or cache the removed seed. Using experimental seeds with controlled differences in size, tannin and nutrient content, we evaluated how different traits influence each step in this decision process. We found that different traits had distinct effects on each step. Seed size affected all four steps, while nutrient and tannin content primarily affected the first and third steps. By dissecting foraging behavior in relation to experimentally controlled seed-traits, we have created an effective framework within which to understand the unique relationship between scatter-hoarding rodents that both predate and disperse plant seeds.

TI  - MASTING MEDIATED BY SUMMER DROUGHT REDUCES ACORN PREDATION IN MEDITERRANEAN OAK FORESTS
PY  - 2008
AB  - Temporally variable production of seed crops by perennial plants (masting) has been hypothesized to be a valuable mechanism in the reduction of seed predation by satiating and starving seed consumers. To achieve these benefits, coexisting species subjected to the same predator would benefit from a similar pattern of seeding fluctuation over time that could lead to a reduction in predation at the within-species level. We tested for the existence of an environmental factor enforcing synchrony in acorn production in two sympatric Mediterranean oaks (Quercus ilex and Q. humilis) and the consequences on within-species and between-species acorn predation, by monitoring 15 mixed forests (450 trees) over seven years. Acorn production in Q. ilex and Q. humilis was highly variable among years, with high population variability (CVp) values. The two species exhibited a very different pattern across years in their initial acorn crop size (sum of aborted, depredated, and sound acorns). Nevertheless, interannual differences in summer water stress modified the likelihood of abortion during acorn ripening and enforced within- and, particularly, between-species synchrony and population variability in acorn production. The increase in CVp from initial to mature acorn crop (after summer) accounted for 33% in Q. ilex, 59% in Q. humilis, and 60% in the two species together. Mean yearly acorn pre-dispersal predation by invertebrates was considerably higher in Q. humilis than in Q. ilex. Satiation and starvation of predators was recorded for the two oaks, and this effect was increased by the year-to-year variability in the size of the acorn crop of the two species combined. Moreover, at a longer time scale (over seven years), we observed a significant reduction in the mean proportion of acorns depredated for each oak and the variability in both species' acorn production combined. Therefore, our results demonstrate that similar patterns of seeding fluctuation over time in coexisting species mediated by an environmental cue (summer drought) may contribute to the reduction of the impact of seed predation at a within-species level. Future research should be aimed at addressing whether this process could be a factor assisting in the coexistence of Q. ilex and Q. humilis.

TI  - Do scatter hoarders trade off increased predation risks for lower rates of cache pilferage
PY  - 2013
AB  - Scatter hoarding is a common food-hoarding strategy of many granivores, known to significantly contribute to seed dispersal. Models of scatter hoarding typically hold that the spatial distribution of the scatter hoards made by birds and mammals result from a trade-off between the energetic cost of spacing caches and the increased risk of pilferage as cache densities increase. Here, we present evidence from 3 field experiments that eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) rely on an alternative strategy in which preferred food items are stored in open habitats, beyond tree crowns, where the probability of predation is higher but the risk of cache pilferage is also reduced (hereafter the habitat structure hypothesis). In the first 2 experiments, squirrels cached larger, more profitable acorns at significantly greater distances from canopy edges than smaller acorns, which were more often cached under trees. In the third experiment, in which we tested the effects of both tree canopy cover and cache density on pilferage rates, we found no effect of density on pilferage rates but significantly higher pilferage rates under canopy cover. Our results indicate that habitat heterogeneity, potentially as it relates to predation risks, influences the distribution of scatter-hoarded seeds, with more profitable seeds placed in more open vegetation beyond the shadow of parent plants. We suggest that this behavior may reflect a general strategy of other scatter-hoarding mammals and birds that likely increases the probability of dispersal and establishment of seeds.

TI  - The resource availability hypothesis revisited: a meta‐analysis
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary
1. Several theories have provided a framework for understanding variation in plant defence against herbivores. Among them, the plant apparency theory and the resource availability hypothesis (RAH) have aimed to explain the patterns of defence investment and the selective pressures that have led to the variety of defensive strategies across species. Here we provide a historical review of both theories, present evidence that shaped their development and contrast their predictions.

2. We present the results of a meta-analysis of the utility of the RAH 25 years after it was proposed and compare it to apparency theory. We performed a meta-analysis of 50 studies that have examined plant growth, defences and herbivory in relation to resource availability across latitude and ontogeny. Specifically, we tested four predictions that follow the RAH: (i) species adapted to resource-rich environments have intrinsically faster growth rates than species adapted to resource-poor environments; (ii) fast-growing species have shorter leaf lifetimes than slow-growing species; (iii) fast-growing species have lower amounts of constitutive defences than slow-growing species; and (iv) fast-growing species support higher herbivory rates than slow-growing species.

3. Our results confirm the predictions that species adapted to resource-poor environments grow inherently more slowly, invest more in constitutive defences and support lower herbivory than species from more productive habitats. Our data also showed that variation in growth rate among species better explains the differences in herbivory than variation in apparency, suggesting that the evolution of different defensive strategies across species is resource, rather than herbivore driven. We also found that the application of this theory appears robust across latitude and ontogeny, as the magnitude of the effect sizes for most of the predictions did not vary significantly between ecosystems or across ontogenic stages.

4. We conclude that the RAH has served as a valid framework for investigating the patterns of plant defences and that its applicability is quite general.

TI  - Leftovers in seed dispersal: ecological implications of partial seed consumption for oak regeneration
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Successful seed dispersal by animals is assumed to occur when undamaged seeds arrive at a favourable microsite. Most seed removal and dispersal studies consider only two possible seed fates, predation or escape intact. Whether partial consumption of seeds has ecological implications for natural regeneration is unclear. We studied partial consumption of seeds in a rodent-dispersed oak species. 2. Fifteen percent of dispersed acorns were found partially eaten in a field experiment. Most damage affected only the basal portion of the seeds, resulting in no embryo damage. Partially eaten acorns had no differences in dispersal distance compared to intact acorns but were recovered at farther distances than completely consumed acorns. 3. Partially eaten acorns were found under shrub cover unlike intact acorns that were mostly dispersed to open microhabitats. 4. Partially eaten acorns were not found buried proportionally more often than intact acorns, leading to desiccation and exposure to biotic agents (predators, bacteria and fungi). However, partial consumption caused more rapid germination, which enables the acorns to tolerate the negative effects of exposure. 5. Re-caching and shrub cover as microhabitat of destination promote partial seed consumption. Larger acorns escaped predation more often and had higher uneaten cotyledon mass. Satiation at seed level is the most plausible explanation for partial consumption. 6. Partial consumption caused no differences in root biomass when acorns experienced only small cotyledon loss. However, root biomass was lower when acorns experienced heavy loss of tissue but, surprisingly, they produced longer roots, which allow the seeds to gain access sooner to deeper resources. 7. Synthesis. Partial consumption of acorns is an important event in the oak regeneration process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most acorns were damaged non-lethally, without decreasing both dispersal distances and the probability of successful establishment. Faster germination and production of longer roots allow partially eaten seeds to tolerate better the exposure disadvantages caused by the removal of the pericarp and the non-buried deposition. Consequently, partially consumed seeds can contribute significantly to natural regeneration and must be considered in future seed dispersal studies.

TI  - SEED MASS AND MAST SEEDING ENHANCE DISPERSAL BY A NEOTROPICAL SCATTER-HOARDING RODENT
PY  - 2004
AB  - Many tree species that depend on scatter-hoarding animals for seed dispersal produce massive crops of large seeds at irregular intervals. Mast seeding and large seed size in these species have been explained as adaptations to increase animal dispersal and reduce predation. We studied how seed size and seed abundance simultaneously influenced seed dispersal and predation by scatter-hoarding rodents in the large-seeded rain forest tree Carapa procera (Meliaceae) in French Guiana. We individually tracked the fates of 3000 seeds, using remote video monitoring and thread-marking. Seed size was manipulated by broadly varying intraspecific seed mass, whereas effects of seed abundance were examined by tracking seeds in three seed-rich years and two seed-poor years. The hypotheses, that seed mass and seed abundance both enhance dispersal success and that seed abundance reinforces the effect of seed mass, were supported by the results. Most seeds were removed by the scatter-hoarding rodent red acouchy (Myoprocta acouchy) and subsequently were buried in scattered, single-seeded caches up to distances >100 m. Seeds that were not removed failed to establish seedlings. Seed removal was slower, pre-removal seed predation was greater, and seed dispersal was less far in seed-rich years than in seed-poor years, suggesting poorer dispersal under seed abundance. However, this was more than counterbalanced by a disproportionally greater survival of cached seeds in seed-rich years. The per capita probability of seed survival and seedling establishment was at least 4½ times greater under seed abundance. Large seeds were removed faster, were more likely to be scatter-hoarded, and were dispersed farther away than smaller ones, resulting in a higher probability of seedling establishment for larger seeds. Size discrimination was greater under seed abundance, albeit only during seed removal. Overall, large seeds shed in rich years had the highest probability of seedling establishment. Hence, both larger seed size and greater seed abundance stimulate rodents to act more as dispersers and less as predators of seeds. We conclude that scatter-hoarding rodents can select for both large seed crops and large seeds, which may reinforce mast seeding.

TI  - Simulated N deposition negatively impacts sugar maple regeneration in a northern hardwood ecosystem
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. During the next century, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to more than double, potentially leading to a decline in plant diversity as well as a change in plant community composition and structure. 2. In a decade-long field experiment, simulated atmospheric N deposition has slowed litter decay, resulting in an accumulation of forest floor (i.e. Oi & Oe horizons). We reasoned that a greater forest floor mass under simulated N deposition would impose a physical barrier to sugar maple Acer saccharum seedling establishment, thereby reducing seedling populations of an ecologically and economically important tree species. 3. To test this idea, we first quantified sugar maple seedling abundance in replicate northern hardwood forest stands receiving ambient atmospheric N (7–12 kg N ha )1 year )1 ) and experimental atmospheric N deposition, simulating future amounts in eastern North America (ambient plus 30 kg NO3 Nh a )1 year )1 ). Then, we experimentally manipulated forest floor mass under ambient and simulated N deposition treatments. Finally, we transplanted first-year established seedlings into areas receiving ambient and simulated N deposition and quantified their mortality after 1 year. 4. First-year seedling abundance did not differ under ambient and simulated N deposition; however, there were greater abundances of second- and third-to-fifth-year seedlings under ambient N deposition ( P< 0AE001). In all cases, experimental manipulation to increase forest floor mass, equivalent to that under simulated N deposition, resulted in significantly (P =0 AE001) fewer established individuals, regardless of whether the greater forest floor mass occurred under ambient or simulated N deposition. Finally, fewer 1-year-old transplanted seedlings survived when grown under simulated N, albeit that result was not statistically significant. 5. Synthesis and applications. The slowing of decay and the accumulation of forest floor under anthropogenic N deposition can negatively impact seedling survival and potentially alter stand development and structural diversity. As atmospheric N deposition increases globally, it becomes necessary to understand the mechanisms that lead to population changes for ecologically important tree species. The responses we document should be considered in simulations of future of forest dynamics, as atmospheric N deposition continues to increase, specifically when sugar maple life-history traits are included to simulate regeneration, structural diversity and stand development.

TI  - Where Has All the White Oak Gone
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract Before European settlement, vast areas of deciduous forest in what is now the eastern United States were dominated by oak species. Among these species, white oak (Quercus alba) reigned supreme. White oak tended to grow at lower elevations but was distributed across a broad range of sites, from wet mesic to subxeric, and grew on all but the wettest and most xeric, rocky, or nutrient-poor soils. A comparison of witness tree data from early land surveys and data on modern-day forest composition revealed a drastic decline in white oak throughout the eastern forest. By contrast, other dominant oaks, such as red oak (Quercus rubra) and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), often exhibited higher frequency in recent studies than in surveys of the original forest. The frequency of red oak witness trees before European settlement was quite low, generally under 5% in most forests. Red oak's distribution was apparently limited by a lower tolerance to fire and drought and a greater dependence on catastrophic distur...

TI  - Scatterhoarding rodents favor higher predation risks for cache sites: The potential for predators to influence the seed dispersal process.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Scatterhoarding rodents often place caches in the open where pilferage rates are reduced, suggesting that they tradeoff higher risks of predation for more secure cache sites. We tested this hypothesis in two study systems by measuring predation risks inferred from measures of giving-up densities (GUDs) at known cache sites and other sites for comparison. Rodent GUDs were measured with small trays containing 3 L of fine sand mixed with sunflower seeds. In the first experiment, we relied on a 2-year seed dispersal study in a natural forest to identify caches of eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and then measured GUDs at: (i) these caches; (ii) comparable points along logs and rocks where rodent activity was assumed highest; and (iii) a set of random points. We found that GUDs and, presumably, predation risks, were higher at both cache and random points than those with cover. At the second site, we measured GUDs of eastern gray squirrels in an open park system and found that GUDs were consistently lowest at the base of the tree compared to more open sites, where previous studies show caching by squirrels to be highest and pilferage rates by naive competitors to be lowest. These results confirm that predation risks can influence scatterhoarding decisions but that they are also highly context dependent, and that the landscape of fear, now so well documented in the literature, could potentially shape the temporal and spatial patterns of seedling establishment and forest regeneration in systems where scatterhoarding is common.

TI  - Abiotic and biotic factors and their interactions as causes of oak decline in Central Europe
PY  - 2002
AB  - Summary Incidences of oak decline have occurred repeatedly during the past three centuries as well as in the most recent decades. On the basis of historical records and dendrochronological measurements, oak decline in Central Europe has been attributed to the single or combined effects of climatic extremes (winter frost, summer drought), defoliating insects, and pathogenic fungi. Starting from a literature review, we discuss the possible roles of various abiotic (air pollution, nitrogen eutrophication, soil chemical stress, climatic extremes, site conditions) and biotic factors (insect defoliation, borer attack, infection by pathogenic fungi, microorganisms) that have been related to oak decline. On the basis of investigations on Quercus petraea and Quercus robur at three different levels (from experiments with young trees to monitoring on a supraregional scale), we suggest a conceptual model of the interaction of abiotic and biotic factors responsible for the onset of oak decline. This model should be valid for Central European oak stands at more acidic sites (soil pH (H2O) £ 4.2; on soils with higher pH, pathogenic Phytophthora species may contribute to oak decline). The combination of severe insect defoliation in at least two consecutive years with climatic extremes is the most significant complex of factors in the incidence of oak decline. Combined with defoliation, summer drought or winter ⁄ spring frost or both have to occur within the same year or in consecutive years to trigger major outbreaks of decline. Important additional stress factors are the following: (1) hydromorphic site conditions which, particularly in the case of Q. robur, render the trees more susceptible to drought stress as a result of an impairment of root growth in the subsoil; and (2), possibly, excess nitrogen which, in combination with drought stress, results in distinct decreases in the foliar concentrations of allelochemicals in Q. robur, thereby probably making the trees more susceptible to insect defoliation. Air pollution, soil chemical stress (including excess manganese), and nitrogen-induced nutritional imbalance do not seem to be important causal factors in the complex of oak decline. On the basis of the model, the appearance of the most recent oak decline in North-western Germany can be adequately explained.

TI  - Seed fate and decision‐making processes in scatter‐hoarding rodents
PY  - 2015
AB  - A mechanistic understanding of seed movement and survival is important both for the development of theoretical models of plant population dynamics, spatial spread, and community assembly, and for the conservation and management of plant communities under global change. While models of wind-borne seed dispersal have advanced rapidly over the past two decades, models for animal-mediated dispersal have failed to make similar progress due to their dependence on interspecific interactions and complex, context-dependent behaviours. In this review, we synthesize the literature on seed dispersal and consumption by scatter-hoarding, granivorous rodents and outline a strategy for development of a general mechanistic seed-fate model in these systems. Our review decomposes seed dispersal and survival into six distinct sub-processes (exposure, harvest, allocation, preparation, placement, and recovery), and identifies nine intermediate (latent) variables that link physical state variables (e.g. seed and animal traits, habitat structure) to decisions regarding seed allocation to hoarding or consumption, cache placement and management, and deployment of radicle-pruning or embryo excision behaviours. We also highlight specific areas where research on these intermediate relationships is needed to improve our mechanistic understanding of scatter-hoarder behaviour. Finally, we outline a strategy to combine detailed studies on individual functional relationships with seed-tracking experiments in an iterative, hierarchical Bayesian framework to construct, refine, and test mechanistic models for context-dependent, scatter-hoarder-mediated seed fate.

TI  - Directed seed dispersal towards areas with low conspecific tree density by a scatter‐hoarding rodent
PY  - 2012
AB  - Scatter-hoarding animals spread out cached seeds to reduce density-dependent theft of their food reserves. This behaviour could lead to directed dispersal into areas with lower densities of conspecific trees, where seed and seedling survival are higher, and could profoundly affect the spatial structure of plant communities. We tested this hypothesis with Central American agoutis and Astrocaryum standleyanum palm seeds on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We radio-tracked seeds as they were cached and re-cached by agoutis, calculated the density of adult Astrocaryum trees surrounding each cache, and tested whether the observed number of trees around seed caches declined more than expected under random dispersal. Seedling establishment success was negatively dependent on seed density, and agoutis carried seeds towards locations with lower conspecific tree densities, thus facilitating the escape of seeds from natural enemies. This behaviour may be a widespread mechanism leading to highly effective seed dispersal by scatter-hoarding animals.

TI  - Climate drivers of seed production in Picea engelmannii and response to warming temperatures in the southern Rocky Mountains
PY  - 2016
AB  - The increases in seed output observed in this study may promote population fitness of P. engelmannii in the face of changing climate regimes and increasing frequencies of fire- and insect-related tree mortality in the Rocky Mountains. Since this species lacks a persistent seed bank, re-colonization of disturbed areas or dispersal to shifting habitats depends on adequate production of seed by surviving trees, which according to these analyses may be moderately enhanced by current climate trends. However, some evidence also indicates that increases in seed output will ultimately be constrained by threshold high temperatures in the seed maturation year.

TI  - Effects of weather conditions on mast year frequency in beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.) in Sweden
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary During the last two decades, an increase of the frequency of naturally regenerated beech seedlings has been reported. This may be due to an increased masting. In this investigation in southern Sweden, mast year frequency, mast crop size and the relationships between mast year and climatic variables were studied. Our analysis shows that while the average mast year interval was 4 – 6 years from the end of the seventeenth century up to the 1960s, the mean interval has decreased to 2.5 years during the most recent 30 years, and there have been two consecutive mast years on two occasions during this later period. Mast years have often followed years in which the temperature in July and September was higher than the 30-year mean. However, there were signifi cant variations in the amounts of beechnuts produced between different mast years, and beechnut production increased with increasing site index. Climatic changes, especially increases in temperature, may have been responsible for the higher frequency of mast years, but increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition may also have been a contributory factor.

TI  - Impacts of elevated nitrogen inputs on oak reproductive and seed ecology
PY  - 2007
AB  - The effects of increased anthropogenic inputs of reactive nitrogen (N) have been studied at the Harvard Forest Chronic N Experiment, where NH 4 NO 3 has been applied experimentally since 1988 to increase atmospheric deposition rates ∼6- and ∼18-fold above ambient. This paper asks whether conditions favorable to primary production also resulted in plastic increases to flower, fruit, and seedling traits, and focuses primarily on the oaks that dominate the hardwood stands of the Harvard Forest experiment. Litterfall samples collected between 1996 and 2001 revealed that flowers and fruits were significantly more abundant in N-treated plots, and an analysis of oak tree abundance found significant variation both among and within plots. Acom samples collected during 2003 and 2004 (a mast and a postmast year) were therefore analyzed using ANCOVA models that included an estimate of oak tree abundance. This tree abundance estimate was the only significant driver of increased acorn production during the mast year, and in both years it was a significant factor on plots receiving the highest levels of N. In the postmast year, acorn production was increased in direct response to N-related factors other than tree abundance. Our comparisons of control and N-treated plots for acorn quality traits (e.g. rates of acorn damage, germination percentage, seedling growth) revealed negligible or only transient differences. Shifts in overall acom abundance - particularly disproportionate N-mediated increases during nonmast years - could have a wide range of ecological consequences beyond the more frequently examined impacts of N deposition on primary production and carbon sequestration.

TI  - Disentangling the effect of competition, CO2 and climate on intrinsic water‐use efficiency and tree growth
PY  - 2016
AB  - Climate change scenarios forecast rising temperatures for the Mediterranean region, which could enhance the vulnerability to drought stress in forest ecosystems. The long‐term effects of climate forcing on tree performance can be, however, modulated by other environmental factors, such as competition and rising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. We assessed the concomitant effect of competition, climate and CO₂ concentrations on the tree‐ring δ¹³C‐derived intrinsic water‐use efficiency (iWUE) and basal area increments (BAI) of species with different drought tolerance: two Mediterranean deciduous species (Quercus faginea Lam. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and one conifer (Pinus sylvestris L.). Additionally, given that competition may be managed to mitigate the effect of increasing drought stress, we further examined the influence of this variable on iWUE and growth using data compiled from the literature, providing the first review on the response of iWUE to competition. Competition had no significant effect on iWUE in any of the three species studied, whereas, as expected, growth rates were significantly higher under low‐competition levels. This was consistent with the literature review, which showed that shifts in iWUE with competition changes are rare; supporting the hypothesis that leaf‐level gas exchange tends to be a homeostatic trait. In the long term, the three species exhibited a significant increasing trend in iWUE due to the combined effect of increased CO₂ concentration, climate and age. Growth, however, was mostly affected by competition and climate and in most cases was not enhanced as a result of the increase in iWUE. Synthesis. Regardless of their functional response to drought, trees respond to reduced competition through the structural shifts such as increased radial growth rather than leaf‐level gas exchange adjustments. CO₂ and climate are, therefore, the main drivers of iWUE variability, rather than competition. Thus, if temperature‐induced drought becomes limiting, reducing competition for resources may not offset the detrimental effect of increasing drought stress on tree physiology and growth decline may occur without a CO₂ fertilization effect.

The emphasis on forests in general is important for two reasons. First, forests often occupy areas receiving high rates of atmospheric deposition of N. Second, compared with herb-dominated communities, about which much is known regarding response to excess N, forests generally display greater biological and structural complexity. The more specific focus on the herbaceous layer ‐ here defined as all vascular (herbaceous and woody) plants ≤ 1 m in height ‐ is warranted because most of the species diversity of forests occurs in the herb layer. 2 Most responses of forest ecosystems to N saturation, defined here as ecosystem supply of N exceeding ecosystem demand for N, can be characterized by two complementary hypotheses, each emphasizing different facets of ecosystem structure and function. One focuses on ecosystem processes, such as net primary productivity, whereas the other addresses seasonal patterns of concentrations of in stream water. Although neither hypothesis considers the effects of chronically elevated N deposition on forest herbs, both share a prediction ‐ a dramatic increase in availability of ‐ that is relevant to forest herb response. Such a shift towards dominance has important implications for changes in herbaceous layer dynamics. For example, increases in soil pools can increase invasibility by exotic species. Also, because preferential use of vs. can be highly species-specific among forest herbs, predominance of availability can bring about further changes in herb layer species composition. Also important to forest herbs is the tendency for enhanced mobility of to increase mobility and decrease availability of essential cations, such as Ca 2+ . 3 The response of plant species of the herbaceous layer of forest ecosystems to excess N availability can arise from N-mediated changes in several processes. Here I identify six ‐ competition, herbivory, mycorrhizal infection, disease, species invasions and exotic earthworm activity ‐ and discuss how they respond to excess N and how this response affects the herb layer of forests. With the exception of the activity of exotic earthworms (which is correlated with, but not necessarily caused by, high N deposition), there is compelling evidence that all processes respond sensitively to N deposition and that this response generally leads to drastic shifts in species composition and decreases in biodiversity of forest herb communities. 4 A hypothesis is suggested ‐ the nitrogen homogeneity hypothesis ‐ that predicts loss of biodiversity in forest ecosystems experiencing chronically elevated N deposition. This hypothesis is based on the decrease in spatial heterogeneity of N availability that is typically high in forest soils under N-limited conditions.

TI  - Mast seeding under increasing drought: results from a long-term data set and from a rainfall exclusion experiment.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Mast seeding, the synchronous, highly variable seed production among years, is very common in tree species, but there is no consensus about its main causes and the main environmental factors affecting it. In this study, we first analyze a long-term data set on reproductive and vegetative growth of Quercus ilex in a mediterranean woodland in order to identify the main environmental drivers of interannual variation in flower and seed production and contrast the impact of climate vs. adaptive factors as main causes of masting. Second, we conducted an experiment of rainfall exclusion to evaluate the effects of an increasing drought (simulating predictions of global change models) on both reproductive processes. The annual seed crop was always affected by environmental factors related to the precipitation pattern, these abiotic factors disrupting the fruiting process at different periods of time. Seed production was strongly dependent upon water availability for the plant at initial (spring) and advanced (summer) stages of the acorn maturation cycle, whereas the final step of seed development was negatively affected by the frequency of torrential-rain events. We also found clear evidence that seed masting in the study species is not only regulated by selective endogenous rhythms, but is mainly a physiological response to the variable environment. Our results from the rainfall exclusion experiment corroborated the conclusions obtained from the 26-year fruiting record and demonstrated that the high interannual variation in seed crop was mainly determined by the success in seed development rather than by the flowering effort. Under a global change scenario, it could be expected that the drier conditions predicted by climate models reinforce the negative effects of summer drought on seed production, leading to negative consequences for tree recruitment and forest dynamics.

TI  - Positive effects of an invasive shrub on aggregation and abundance of a native small rodent
PY  - 2012
AB  - Invasive plants can have dramatic effects on natural ecosystems. It is unclear, though, whether these will have a positive or negative effect on animal species’ behavior and population parameters within ecosystems where invasive plants occur. Here, we use a 2-year time series of mouse trapping data to test the effects of an evergreen invasive shrub, Rhododendron ponticum, on population distribution and abundance in a population of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in southern England. Given the importance of aerial predators on rodent survival and the shield that the thick cover of Rhododendron branches and leaves provides, we predicted that Rhododendron would have a positive effect on mouse aggregation and abundance. The results confirmed both predictions: proximity to Rhododendron positively influenced mouse abundance, whereas a significant interaction between protective microhabitat features (logs) and Rhododendron suggest that reductions in predation risk drive the proximity results. In addition, as mouse densities increased, competition increased. During spring, when mouse territoriality was greatest, we found primarily large adults in the Rhododendron habitat, with subadult and juvenile mice more likely to be found away from Rhododendron patches. The effects of Rhododendron-driven increases in mouse density on lower (seed predation and dispersal) and upper trophic level (weasel populations) are also discussed. Questing tick’s density and invertebrate biomass were also lower under Rhododendron. Our research shows that an invasive plant species can increase the abundance of a native mammal and that this could potentially lead to increases/decreases in other species populations within the community. Key wor ds: Apodemus sylvaticus , edible invertebrate biomass, intraspecific competition, invasive shrub, predation risk, spatial variation, ticks, wood mouse. [Behav Ecol]

TI  - Quantifying the outcome of plant-granivore interactions
PY  - 2011
AB  - In many interspecific interactions, the balance of costs and benefits varies with ecological circumstances. As a prominent example, seed-caching granivores may act as seed predators and reduce plant recruitment or as seed dispersers and increase recruitment, making it difficult to interpret whether differences in seed removal by granivores would harm or benefit plant populations. We used a heuristic model to evaluate the outcome of plant-granivore interactions, using commonly measured field data: probability of seedling emergence when granivores are excluded, and emergence of cached and uneaten seeds. Published studies to date suggest that the outcome of plant-rodent interactions tends weakly towards mutualism, but differs among particular plant–granivore pairs and ecological conditions, supporting the notion of context-dependence. A modeling framework also allowed us to distinguish parameters that affect the qualitative outcome of plant–granivore interactions from those that do not. Similar approaches would facilitate more efficient and cost-effective evaluation of complex species interactions.

TI  - Linking seed dispersal to cache protection strategies.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. The spatial distribution of dispersed seeds results from the combined action of the caching strategies followed by different granivores. Hence, it is essential to study the factors that influence seed predation and caching decisions to achieve a better understanding of the dispersal process. 2. In this study, we document how seed dispersal and the spatial patterns of natural recruitment are linked to the strategies used by granivores to protect their cached seeds from pilferage. We present a theoretical model showing that those strategies may convey benefits for both seed cachers and plants. 3. We studied the relationships among seed production, seed predation ⁄ caching, cache pilferage and plant recruitment in a savanna-like landscape of oaks dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents. 4. Our results show that acorn-dispersing rodents were concentrated under the canopies of scattered oaks, where the theft of cached acorns increased by 77% as compared to that of the surrounding open landscape. Acorns were thus cached selectively in the open areas to reduce pilferage; in fact, none of the few seeds cached beneath tree canopies survived predation by granivores (pilferage + recovery). Meanwhile, some acorns cached in the surrounding open areas were neither pilfered nor recovered and then recruited successfully. Accordingly, natural recruitment of newly emerged seedlings was higher outside than under canopies, suggesting that rodent caching strategies have direct implications for the directed dispersal of oaks. 5. Synthesis. The spatial patterns of seed dispersal shape the fitness of both the plant because they influence dispersal and recruitment efficiency, and the granivores that cache and predate its seeds because they influence their foraging efficiency. Cache protection strategies reduce pilferage significantly and enhance seed recovery rates by the cache owner. At the same time, more seeds remain dispersed and unrecovered. Thus, cache protection strategies can provide net benefits to the plant in terms of effective directed dispersal.

TI  - Intraspecific variation in seed size affects scatterhoarding behaviour of an Australian tropical rain-forest rodent
PY  - 2003
AB  - Vertebrate seed dispersers could impact the evolution of seed size or alter the pattern of seedling recruitment if they responded differently to seeds of varying size (Jordano 1995). For example, models of seed caching by birds and mammals predict that seeds of higher nutritive value should be placed farther from parent trees and in lower densities than lower quality seeds (Clarkson et al. 1986, Stapanian & Smith 1978, Tamura et al. 1999). Comparisons of seed removal rates among tropical tree species in South-East Asia (Blate et al. 1998) and Australia (Osunkoya 1994) failed to show a relationship between seed size and removal rate, although the probability that a seed was scatterhoarded by agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) in a neotropical rain forest increased with interspecific seed size (Forget et al. 1998).

TI  - Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4
PY  - 2015
AB  - Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.

TI  - The relationship between fruit crop sizes and fruit removal rates by birds
PY  - 1986
AB  - It has been proposed that large fruit crops attract disproportionately more frugivores than smaller fruit crops (Snow 1971, Howe and Estabrook 1977). If this is so, then competition between plants for frugivores could be an important source of selection on fruit crop sizes. Field tests of this hypothesis on tropical trees have produced equivocal results (Howe and Smallwood 1982). In six species of fall-fruiting temperate plants, we asked whether the percentage of the fruit that was removed was related to the size of the fruit

TI  - The population dynamics of an alien insect : Andricus quercuscalicis (Hymenoptera : Cynipidae)
PY  - 1991
AB  - SUMMARY (1) We describe the results of the first 10 years of a long-term study of the population biology of a cynipid gall wasp, Andricus quercuscalicis (Burgsdorf 1783), an alien herbivorous insect that appears to have reached the limits of its geographical distribution within England. (2) We document the annual fluctuations in abundance of the sexual generation on Quercus cerris (L.), the Turkey oak, and the agamic (parthenogenetic) generation on Q. robur (L.), the English oak, as measured by gall densities per shoot of the host tree. The sexual generation has fluctuated 6-fold and the agamic generation has fluctuated 10-fold over the 10-year period. (3) Resource use and rates of parasitism vary substantially between the two generations. The agamic generation on Q. robur uses 35-60% of the acorn crop in any given year, whereas the sexual generation on Q. cerris uses only 2-8% of the male flowers. There was virtually no parasitism of the agamic generation, while the sexual generation suffers 25-35% mortality from a group of five native parasitoids. (4) The two generations appear to be loosely coupled. It is impossible to predict the abundance of one generation from the numbers in the previous generation, either within or between years. Three features of the system contribute to this uncoupling: (i) the insect is food limited in the agamic generation; (ii) acorn production fluctuated 20-fold, independent of gall densities; (iii) there were two large variable migration mortalities between each generation. (5) There was extremely high tree-to-tree variation in the rate of galling on both species of oak, and these differences were consistent from year to year. Some trees have never been galled, while others support predictably high gall densities losing over 90% of their acorns every year. The possible causes and consequences of this heterogeneity are discussed. (6) The invasion of A. quercuscalicis appears to have had less impact on the native guild of oak-galling cynipids than might have been predicted. Competitive effects appear to be negligible, as the wasp attacks tissues on the two oak species that are not utilized by other cynipids in the U.K. The effect of adding an abundant new host on the dynamics of shared natural enemies was reduced because virtually all the parasitoids emerging from the sexual galls on Q. cerris were males, and the agamic galls were almost parasite-free.

TI  - Jays and oaks: An eco-ethological study of a symbiosis
PY  - 1979
AB  - The European jay (Garrulus g. glandarius) strongly depends on acorns for food. Many acorns are hoarded enabling the jay to feed upon them at times of the year in which they would otherwise be unavailable. Many of the hoarded acorns germinate and become seedlings so that jays play an important role in the dispersal of acorns and the reproduction of oaks (in this study: Quercus robur, the pedunculate oak). These mutual relationships were analysed both with wild jays in the field (province of Drente, The Netherlands) and with tame birds in confinement. Variation in the composition of the food throughout the year is described quantitatively. Acorns were the stock diet of adults in most months of the year. Leaf-eating caterpillars predominantly occurring on oak were the main food items of nestlings. Acorns formed the bulk of the food of fledglings in June. A high rate of acorn consumption in winter, spring and early summer becomes possible because individual jays hoard several thousands of acorns, mainly in October. In experiments, acorns of pedunculate oak were not preferred over equal sized acorns of sessile oak (which was not found in the study area). Acorns of pedunculate oak were strongly preferred over those of American oak and nuts of hazel and beech. Among acorns of pedunculate oak, ripe, sound, long-slim and big ones were preferred. Jays collect one or more (up to six) acorns per hoarding trip. In the latter case, the first ones are swallowed and the last one is usually carried in the bill. For swallowing the dimensions of the beak imposed a limit on size preference; for bill transport usually the biggest acorn was selected. The greater the number of acorns per trip, the longer was the transportation distance during hoarding. From trip to trip jays dispersed their acorns widely and when several acorns were transported during one trip, these were generally buried at different sites. Burial took place by pushing acorns in the soil and by subsequent hammering and covering. Jays often selected rather open sites, transitions in the vegetation and vertical structures such as saplings and tree trunks, for burial of acorns. In captivity jays also hoarded surplus food. Here, spacing out of burials was also observed; previously used sites usually being avoided. In addition, hiding along substrate edges and near conspicuous objects was observed. Jays tended to hide near sticks presented in a horizontal position rather than near identical ones in vertical position, especially when the colour of the sticks contrasted with the colour of the substrate. Also, rough surfaced substrate was strongly preferred over similar but smooth surfaced substrate. Successful retrieval of and feeding on hoarded acorns were observed in winter even when snow-cover had considerably altered the scenery. No evidence was obtained that acorns could be traced back by smell. Many indications were obtained that visual information from near and far beacons, memorized during hiding, was used in finding acorns. The use of beacons by captive jays was also studied. Experiments led to the conclusion that vertical beacons are more important to retrieving birds than identical horizontal ones. The discrepancy with the jay's preference for horizontal structures during hiding is discussed. Most seedlings emerge in May and June. The distribution pattern of seedlings and bill prints on the shells of their acorns indicated that many seedlings emerged from acorns hidden by jays in the previous autumn. The cotyledons of these plants remain underground and are in excellent condition in spring and early summer. Jays exploited acorns by pulling at the stem of seedlings and then removing the cotyledons. This did not usually damage the plants severely. Jays can find acorns in this situation partly because they remember where they buried acorns. In addition, it was shown that jays select seedlings of oak rather than ones of other species, and that they preferentially inspected those seedlings that were most profitable in terms of cotyledon yield and quality. Experiments uncovered some of the visual cues used in this discrimination. The effects of hoarding on the preservation of acorns were examined in the field and the laboratory. Being buried reduced the chance that acorns were robbed by conspecifics and other acorn feeders. Scatter hoarding did not lead to better protection of buried acorns than larder hoarding, but the spread of risk was better in the former than the latter. It was concluded that the way in which jays hoard acorns increases the chance that they can exploit them later. In addition, the condition of acorns is better preserved by being buried. An analysis was made of the consequences of the jay's behaviour for oaks. The oak does incur certain costs: some of its acorns are eaten by jays during the dispersal and storage phase, and some seedlings are damaged as a consequence of cotyledon removal. However, these costs are outweighed by the benefits the oak receives. Many of its most viable acorns are widely dispersed and buried at sites where the prospects for further development into mature oak are highly favourable. The adaptiveness of the characters involved in preferential feeding on and hoarding of acorns by jays is discussed in relation to several environmental pressures: competition with allied species; food fluctuations in the jay's niche; and food competitors better equipped to break up hard "dry" fruits. Reversely, jays exert several selective pressures which are likely to have evolutionary consequences for oaks, such as the selection of long-slim and large acorns with tight shells. In addition, oak seedlings with a long tap root and tough stem are selected for. Although other factors than mutual selective pressures between the two may have affected the present day fit between jays and oaks it is concluded that several characters of jays and oaks can be considered as co-adapted features of a symbiotic relationship.

TI  - Rabbit grazing, plant competition and seedling recruitment in acid grassland
PY  - 1990
AB  - (1) Two experiments were done to determine the effect of grazing by rabbits on plant recruitment in mature grassland and on cultivated soil. The first was a factorial experiment, with and without rabbit fencing, and with and without soil cultivation, carried out between 1986 and 1989 in acid grassland with a long history of rabbit grazing. In the second, carried out between 1982 and 1985 in two contrasting arable fields, rabbits grazed crops of winter wheat, with fencing enclosures erected at different times and for different durations. (2) Rabbit grazing affected the stature and composition of the grassland throughout the year. Species that increased in cover in rabbit-grazed grassland included the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum and the forb Rumex acetosella. Species that decreased included the grasses Festuca rubra and Agrostis capillaris and the forbs Vicia sativa and Trifolium repens. There was negligible change in the total number of plant species with grazing. (3) The cultivated treatments showed that the seed bank under the acid grassland was extremely heterogeneous. (4) Eight of the twenty-three commonest ruderal species beneath acid grassland decreased in cover significantly (e.g. Capsella bursa-pastoris and Papaver dubium), and none increased significantly. In contrast, most of the ruderal species in the seed bank of nearby arable soils increased under grazing. (5) Most plant species on cultivated grassland soils regenerated from vegetative fragments (e.g. Holcus mollis, Stellaria graminea, Rumex acetosa and R. acetosella), rather than by germination of seed. Regrowth shoots outnumbered seedlings by a factor of between 3 and 23 3. (6) The extent of spatial heterogeneity within and between plots in both the composition of the buried seed bank, and in recruitment by vegetative regrowth, highlights the need for large sample sizes in this kind of study. (7) The mechanisms that determine whether a plant species increases or decreases under grazing are discussed.

TI  - INDIRECT HERBIVORE MEDIATION OF AVIAN SEED DISPERSAL IN PINYON PINE
PY  - 1991
AB  - During a 4-yr study, we examined how an insect herbivore indirectly influ- enced pinyon pine by affecting its avian seed dispersal agents. Colorado pinyon pine, Pinus edulis, suffered reduced cone initiation and increased cone mortality primarily from in- festation by the stem- and cone-boring moth Dioryctria albovitella. Because avian dispersal agents selectively foraged where cone crops were highest, individual trees and stands of trees with greater insect abundances were avoided. Even herbivore-resistant trees with substantial cone crops did not receive dispersal services if they were surrounded by sus- ceptible trees because the birds often ignored entire stands of trees. A cone removal ex- periment showed that avian seed dispersers also ignored trees with artificially reduced crops even though many cones remained. We argue that masting, the production of large cone crops at irregular intervals, may have evolved to insure dispersal success. The decline in attractiveness of entire stands of trees to dispersal agents due to infestation may functionally alter the sex expression of uninfested individuals.

TI  - What future for British red squirrels
PY  - 1989
AB  - The geographic range of red squirrels contracted sharply in Britain during the 1940s arid 1950s, as increasingly large areas were colonized by the congeneric North American grey squirrel. Red squirrels remain common only on offshore islands, and in the large conifer forests of northern England and Scotland. The initial replacement of red squirrels was in arras dominated by oak woodland, probably because acorn crops are exploited less efficiently by red squirrels than by grey squirrels. Dirt studies have shown that acorns are digested less efficiently by the red squirrel, which occurs in conifers through most of its Eurasian range, than by the introduced grey squirrel, which is primarily a native of deciduous woodland. The red squirrel will probably be replaced in deciduous and mixed woodland throughout mainland Britain, and may eventually persist only in large areas of conifers which arc far from oak trees. The conservation of red squirrels on islands is therefore particularly important for their survival, perhaps making it worthwhile to create new island populations where they do not at present exist.

PY  - 1977
AB  - The flowering, fruiting, seed losses and germination of Fraxinus excelsior L. have been investigated in a Derbyshire ashwood. Despite the complex flowering pattern, fruit fall is evenly distributed throughout the wood and continues for nearly a year from September to August. A large quantity of seed is eaten by Apodemus sylvaticus and Clethrionomysglareolus, some is infested by Pseudargyrofoza conwagana, and in some fruit the seed is immature or absent. Only a very small percentage of seed ultimately germinates; germination usually occurs eighteen to twenty months after the seed has fallen, a long period of dormancy being involved.

TI  - Flower abundance, premature acorn abscission, and acorn production in Quercus alba L
PY  - 1982
AB  - We studied flower abundance and its relationship to acorn crop size on four Quercus alba L. trees in Patrick County, Virginia, for 4 yr. Acorn production was significantly related to spring flower abundance. A linear model was developed which accounted for 83.7% of the variation in acorn crops. Acorn mortality during development was quantified during 2 of the 4 yr. Mortality was gradual with ca. 70% of the flowers failing to produce mature acorns.

TI  - Herbivores and plant diversity.
PY  - 1992
AB  - We study spatial lottery models of competition between two plant species in which competitive ability is affected by levels of herbivory. Herbivory may enhance plant diversity in two qualitatively different ways. The first is global frequency dependence; the level of herbivory suffered by a plant decreases as the species becomes rare. Second, spatial variability in levels of herbivory can create ephemeral, local refuges for herbivory for each plant species. Both of these mechanisms operate only if there is not a negative correlation between a plant's palatability and its competitive ability. Both mechanisms also require that herbivores have sufficiently strong diet preferences (or, equivalently, that the plants have sufficiently different grazing tolerances). If there is no relationship between palatability and competitive ability, then plant diversity is a monotonically increasing function of the herbivore's degree of monophagy. In contrast, if there is a positive correlation between palatability and competitive ability, then the diversity/degree-of-monophagy relationship may be either monotonically increasing or humped.

TI  - RELATION BETWEEN CONE PRODUCTION AND DIAMETER INCREMENT OF DOUGLAS FIR (PSEUDOTSUGA MENZIESII (MIRB.) FRANCO), GRAND FIR (ABIES GRANDIS (DOUGL.) LINDL.), AND WESTERN WHITE PINE (PINUS MONTICOLA DOUGL.)
PY  - 1965
AB  - Cone count records for a 28-year period on 80 Douglas fir, 14 grand fir, and 9 western white pine were statistically analyzed with the annual diameter increment to evaluate the relationship between cone and wood production. The width of annual rings was depressed only during the years of cone production, suggesting that carbohydrates used in cone development were supplied from current photosynthesis rather than from stored reserve. The initiation of reproductive buds did not appear to be dependent on the level of carbohydrates in a tree and the role of carbohydrates was probably only that of nutrition during cone development. Maturing cones did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on initiation of new flowering buds. Different species may require a different combination of climatic factors for initiation of flowering buds.

TI  - Irregular fruiting in Fraxinus excelsior
PY  - 1992
AB  - . Data of fruit-set and fruit production of Fraxinus excelsior (ash) at two sites in the archipelago of Stockholm, Sweden, were recorded over six years (1980-85), with particular emphasis on the fruiting tendency of individual trees. The aim was to determine the grounds for the irregularity of fruiting. There was no support for the assumption that irregular fruiting originates as a consequence of the fruiting tendency being resource limited. The probability of fruiting in a certain year was neither negatively related to previous fruiting years, nor positively related to climatically favourable years. Seeds were infested by the monophagous moth larva Pseudar-gyrotoza conwagana. An increased seed survival was noted in times of large seed crops, indicating seed predator satiation. Date of leafing the preceding year determined whether individual trees fruited or not. This relationship may have significance in synchronizing the fruit production of ash trees.

TI  - REGENERATION OF OAK-BIRCH WOODLAND FOLLOWING EXCLUSION OF SHEEP
PY  - 1983
AB  - (1) Sheep have been excluded for 26 years from 1. 12 ha of woodland dominated by Quercus petraea, Betula pendula and B. pubescens in which there had been no regeneration of oak for at least 50 years and only limited regeneration of birch. (2) Outside the enclosure there is still no regeneration and the field-layer has remained a closely grazed sward of Deschampsiaflexuosa. (3) Inside the enclosure D. flexuosa has grown taller and Vaccinium myrtillus has greatly increased both in cover and in height. (4) Seedlings of Betula spp. are plentifpl every year in the grazed field-layer but most are rapidly destroyed; they are almost absent from the ungrazed field-layer. A proportion of those present within the enclosed area in 1955-56 have survived and are now saplings 1-4 m tall but there is no evidence of subsequent recruitment. (5) Seedlings of Quercus petraea occur both inside and outside the enclosure in those years following large crops of acorns. Outside they are destroyed but inside a proportion of each crop survives to give successive recruitments to the population of saplings. (6) Adequate regeneration of Q. petraea has been achieved simply by excluding sheep. The tallest saplings are now 4-5 m high. There is no evidence that climatic or edaphic conditions are seriously inhibitory. (7) Oak has regenerated both in gaps and beneath the canopy of oak so that, with protection, the proportion of oak is likely to continue to increase and that of birch to decline. (8) Brown podzolic soils and humo-ferric podzols persist both inside and outside the enclosure but the humose horizons inside have become much less compact and contain higher densities of fine roots and mycorrhizae of the trees. This may increase growth rate and reduce mortality of the trees.

TI  - Flowering and Fruiting in the White Oaks. Pistillate Flowering, Acorn Development, Weather, and Yields
PY  - 1967
AB  - Female flowering and acorn development in three species of which oaks were studied in Pennsylvania from April 1949 through August 1962 with emphasis on the effect of weather on floral development and acorn production. Pistillate flowers emerge in late April or early May, 5—10 days after the appearance of staminate flowers. After pollination and fertilization, developemnt of acorn forms begins, and filled acorns mature late in August. Spring air temperatures strongly affect acorn yields. Good white oak acorn crops were obtained in years when a warm 10—day period occurred late in April, with average night temperatures 55—60°F, followed by cooler periods (45—50°F) for 13—20 days early in May. During years when April remained cool and was followed by warm days and nights in May, acorn production was poor. Wind, precipitation, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficits did not significantly influence acorn yields. While some individual trees were inherently copious acorn producers, others in the same stand produced none or a light crop throughout the 14—year period.

TI  - Spatial density dependence in populations of a cynipid gall-former Andricus quercuscalicis
PY  - 1992
AB  - Summary 1. Patterns of spatial density dependence in mortality factors affecting the sexual generation of Andricus quercuscalicis (Burgsdorf 1783) on Quercus cerris (L.) were investigated as part of a long-term study of the population dynamics of the gall wasp. Experimental enhancement of gall density was used to increase the range of densities observed in the field. 2. We present a new application of logistic regression for detecting spatial density dependence in single-sample collections of galls or leaf-mines. The test, first described by Cox (1970) uses GLIM with binomial errors. The performance of the test and the frequency of Type I and Type II errors were assessed by computer simulation of a variety of different ecological circumstances including density independence, mild and severe, direct and inverse density dependence, and proved satisfactory in most respects. 3. In our field data, statistically significant spatial density dependence was detected in about 15% of cases. Out of 62 cases of significant density dependence, 66% were of inverse density dependence. In particular, the gall wasp data demonstrate a preponderance of inverse density dependence in rates of parasitism. Only predation of galls by birds exhibited a consistent pattern of direct density dependence. There was marked variation in the intensity of all mortality factors from tree to tree. 4. As spatial scale is increased from catkins, through buds, shoots and twigs, so the sample size declines and the range of densities increases. Since reducing the sample size reduces the probability of detecting significant density dependence, but increasing the range of densities increases the likelihood of detecting density dependence, the overall effect of changing spatial scale on the probability of detecting density dependence is difficult to predict. Even when density dependence was detected at the smallest scale, the frequency of detection at higher scales declined, and this may be due in part to spatial heterogeneity in the action of density dependence. Thus, it is not obvious whether changes in the rate of detection of density dependence at different spatial scales are statistical artefacts or reflect real changes in the ecology of the organisms involved. 5. There are two potential problems in applying logistic regression to such data sets. First, overdispersion may occur if p (the probability of mortality) varies significantly within the sample. One way of dealing with this is to rescale the model, according to the degree of aggregation. Second, apparent underdispersion may occur if both p and n are low because, with small sample sizes, variation in p may be undetectable. The most obvious solution in this case is to increase the sample size n, though this may be difficult at larger spatial scales. 6. Enhancing gall densities by caging agamic females directly onto the branches of the host tree led to an increase in mean gall density and in the range of gall densities. This, in turn, led to an increase in the detection of inverse density dependence (mainly through parasitoid attack) but had no significant impact on the detection of direct density dependence. The use of experimentally enhanced gall densities appears to hold considerable potential for demonstrating the importance of spatial density dependence, so long as care is taken to ensure that the highest densities are not unrealistic. 567

TI  - Why Do Some Tropical Forests Have So Many Species of Trees
PY  - 2004
AB  - Understanding why there are so many kinds of tropical trees requires learning, not only how tree species coexist, but what factors drive tree speciation and what governs a tree clade’s diversification rate. Many report that hybrid sterility evolves very slowly between separated tree populations. If so, tree species rarely originate by splitting of large populations. Instead, they begin with few trees. The few studies available suggest that reproductive isolation between plant populations usually results from selection driven by lowered fitness of hybrids: speciation is usually a response to a ‘‘niche opportunity.’’ Using Hubbell’s neutral theory of forest dynamics as a null hypothesis, we show that if new tree species begin as small populations, species that are now common must have spread more quickly than chance allows. Therefore, most tree species have some setting in which they can increase when rare. Trees face trade-offs in suitability for different microhabitats, different-sized clearings, different soils and climates, and resistance to different pests. These trade-offs underlie the mechanisms maintaining a-diversity and species turnover. Disturbance and microhabitat specialization appear insufficient to maintain a-diversity of tropical trees, although they may maintain tree diversity north of Mexico or in northern Europe. Many studies show that where trees grow readily, tree diversity is higher and temperature and rainfall are less seasonal. The few data available suggest that pest pressure is higher, maintaining higher tree diversity, where winter is absent. Tree a-diversity is also higher in regions with more tree species, which tend to be larger, free for a longer time from major shifts of climate, or in the tropics, where there are more opportunities for local coexistence.

TI  - Promoting Better Logging Practices in Tropical Forests: A Simulation Analysis of Alternative Regulations
PY  - 2000
AB  - Standard recommendations for im- proving logging practices in tropical forests in- clude lengthening concession agreements, making concessions renewable, and requiring conces- sionaires to deposit performance bonds. In this paper we investigate the likely effectiveness of these recommendations by using a simulation model of a Malaysian rainforest. We focus on two classes of decisions faced by loggers: which log- ging technology to adopt and whether or not to comply with prescribed diameter cutting limits. We predict the impact of alternative regulations on these decisions and on the resulting economic and environmental outcomes. Renewability condi- tions and performance bonds emerge as potent in- struments for improving logger behavior. (JEL Q23)

TI  - Phenology of a tropical rain forest in Malaya.
PY  - 1972
AB  - During 1960-69, observations were made of flowering, fruiting and foliar activity of 61 canopy trees (representing 45 species) in a largely undisturbed tract of Hill Dipterocarp Forest. Rainfall was measured by an accumulating gauge and, at a nearby station, the number of rainy days recorded. Annually recurrent floral cycles were displayed by only ten species. In these and in 11 additional species, foliar cycles were also circannual. Gregarious flowering, apparently in response to drought, occurred in many species in 1963 and 1968. In other years, interspecific differences in periodicity maintained a minimal incidence of flowering at 44%, and fruiting at 27% of species in the sample. Despite specific variations in phenology, the community as a whole exhibited regular seasonality, with single annual peaks of flowering and fruiting and a double peak of leaf production.

TI  - Mast fruiting is a frequent strategy in woody species of eastern South America.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Background 
It is thought that mast seeding is a rare reproductive strategy in the tropics, since tropical climates are less variable, and fruit consumers tend to be more generalist in these regions. However, previous tests of this hypothesis were based on only few tropical datasets, and none from tropical South America. Moreover, reproductive strategies have been quantified based on the coefficient of variation of interannual seed production, an index that potentially confounds masting and high interannual variability in seed production.


Methodology/Principal Findings 
We developed a new approach to model the monthly variability in seed production for 28 tree species, and 20 liana species monitored during 5 years in a tropical forest of Central French Guiana. We found that 23% of the species showed a masting pattern, 54% an annual fruiting pattern, and 23% an irregular fruiting pattern. The majority of masting species were trees (8 out of 11), most of them animal-dispersed. The classification into reproductive strategies based on the coefficient of variation was inconsistent with our results in nearly half of the cases.


Conclusions/Significance 
Our study is the first to clearly evidence the frequency of the masting strategy in a tropical forest community of Eastern South America. The commonness of the masting strategy in tropical plants may promote species coexistence through storage dynamics.

TI  - A monocarpic tree species in a polycarpic world: how can Tachigali vasquezii maintain itself so successfully in a tropical rain forest community?
PY  - 2005
AB  - 1. Although monocarpy is rare among long-lived plant species that grow in stable habitats, one monocarpic species, Tachigali vasquezii, is extremely abundant in the rain forests of the Bolivian Amazon. We analyse how T. vasquezii is able to maintain itself successfully by comparing its life-history traits with those of polycarpic tree species of the same community. We then evaluate the relative importance of such traits using population matrix models. 2. Monocarpic species are expected to have a high fecundity. Seed production per basal area for T. vasquezii is indeed nearly twice that of an average polycarpic species, but this is not sufficient to maintain stable populations. 3. Life-history theory predicts that a monocarpic strategy is advantageous if juvenile survival rates are high compared with adult survival. Although seedlings of T. vasquezii have a lower mortality rate than polycarpic species, its sapling have higher mortality. 4. We found that the success of T. vasquezii is due to its very high diameter growth rates in the larger size classes, which are four times higher than that of an average, co-occurring polycarpic species. Fast diameter growth is enabled by investment in large, leafy crowns and by a low wood density. Applying this high diameter growth in a population model yielded a population growth rate close to that of polycarpic species. Life table response experiment analysis of Tachigali and polycarp models showed that higher growth compensated for the negative demographic effect of 100% adult mortality following reproduction. 5. Rapid growth enables T. vasquezii to reach reproductive maturity in only 49 years, compared with 79 years for an average polycarpic species. It also reduces the risk of dying before eproducing, and 50% more seedlings survive to maturity for T. vasquezii compared with polycarpic species. 6. The dramatic negative demographic consequences of one-time flowering can therefore be completely balanced by taking a shorter time to reach maturity. Taking a time perspective, it appears that Tachigali vasquezii has an advanced, rather than a delayed, reproduction

TI  - Insect seed predators and environmental change
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary


1
The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition.

2
We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity.

3
Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales.

4
Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host–parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species.

5
Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment.

6
Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator–plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.

TI  - The Fitness of Fitness Concepts and the Description of Natural Selection
PY  - 1994
AB  - "Fitness" has been used to indicate a measure of general adaptedness, and to indicate a short-term measure of reproductive success. The former concept seems unproductive in evoutionary biology, but consensus on the exact form of the latter might be possible. Fitness as a short-term measure of reproductive success can be defined from the demographic recurrence equations for genotypic number; it refers to a genotype or to a genotypic combination, if genotypes interact. Fitness summarizes a model for genotypic demography for a given set of assumptions about the population and the genotypic and individual interactions within it. For a population growing at a constant rate, demographic genotypic fitness has the same shape as reproductive value at birth; but reproductive value refers to a cohort of a genotype, while demographic genotypic fitness refers to organisms of one genotype at one moment in time. This is a major conceptual difference, although the numerical identity between demographic genotypic fitness ...

TI  - VERTEBRATE RESPONSES TO SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN SEED PRODUCTION OF MAST-FRUITING DIPTEROCARPACEAE
PY  - 2000
AB  - To examine the interspecific reproductive synchrony of Dipterocarpaceae with vertebrate responses to seed availablity, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution and phenology of more than 2367 adult dipterocarp individuals of 54 species from March 1985 to January 1993 in the Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seven vegetational formations were sampled along an altitudinal gradient from peat swamp forest (5 m a.s.l. (above sea level)) across lowlands to upper montane zones (1100 m a.s.l.) that encompassed two upland valley complexes in a 15-km 2 area. Four significant reproductive events were documented: (1) a common lowland species reproduced outside of mast events in 1986 and in 1990; (2) a localized lowland ''minor'' mast event in 1986 in which 24.3% of the adult trees (21 spp.) participated; (3) a major community-wide mast event (92.8%, 48 spp.) in 1987, just 6 mo after the minor event; and (4) another major community-wide mast fruiting event after a 4-yr intermast interval (88%, 48 spp.) in 1991. West Kalimantan export records of illipe nut (Dipterocarpaceae: Shorea section Pachycarpae) from 1968 to 1997 were compiled as a baseline measure of the frequency and relative intensity of dipterocarp mast-fruiting events in the region ( CV 5 152%). A ''bumper crop'' occurred about every 5 6 2.6 yr (mean 6 1 SD; range 3-9 yr). Fruit production was significantly associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The 1987 and 1991 mast events monitored were the third and fourth largest export years in the province since 1968. Because of the disputed role of vertebrate seed predators in causing and maintaining mast-fruiting behavior, the response of seed-eating vertebrates to this spatiotemporal variation in dipterocarp seed production was examined. Seed of a common, but asynchronous, lowland species was largely consumed by vertebrates. In the 1986 minor mast, 21 dipterocarp species that produced 60 000 seeds/ha (dry mass 46 kg/ha) lost all monitored viable seed to a diversity of resident and nomadic vertebrate seed predators. Timed with dipterocarp seed production in all mast events, nomadic vertebrates increased their pop- ulations through both reproduction and regional movement (numerical response). However, in both the 1987 and 1991 mast events, resident vertebrates destroyed only 1.5% and 2.6% of community seed production, and predation was recorded only in the tails of the fruit-fall distribution. During these community mast events, resident vertebrates switched from dipterocarp seed to feed on fruit and seed from other available species. Nomadic vertebrates arrived late in the fruit-fall period during both major mast events and, thus, were able to destroy only seed dispersed in the final 1-3 wk of fruit-fall. Seed escape, and thus regeneration, only occurred in major mast events when all dipterocarp species across large areas participated. Considerable seedling recruitment was recorded in both the 1987 ( ;95 000 seedlings/ha) and 1991 (155 824 6 36 764 seedlings/ha) mast events. Results from this natural experiment indicate that resident and nomadic vertebrates cause stabilizing selection for tight interspecific synchrony of dipterocarp seedfall over vast regions. Although the pattern generally conformed to the predator-satiation hypothesis, the observed mechanisms for seed escape within a mast-fruiting event did not. Resident and nomadic vertebrate foraging and ranging patterns resulted in dipterocarp seed ''escape'' rather than local ''swamping'' with copious seed production per se. To account for these observations, two hypotheses, ''interfamilial satiation'' and ''regional escape,'' were developed. The period of seed availability and length of the regional intermast interval is examined with seed-predator reproduction and behavior to assess the impact of seed availability on seed-predator populations.

TI  - The ecology of seeds
PY  - 2005
AB  - What determines the number and size of the seeds produced by a plant? How often should it reproduce them? How often should a plant produce them? Why and how are seeds dispersed, and what are the implications for the diversity and composition of vegetation? These are just some of the questions tackled in this wide-ranging review of the role of seeds in the ecology of plants. The authors bring together information on the ecological aspects of seed biology, starting with a consideration of reproductive strategies in seed plants and progressing through the life cycle, covering seed maturation, dispersal, storage in the soil, dormancy, germination, seedling establishment, and regeneration in the field. The text encompasses a wide range of concepts of general relevance to plant ecology, reflecting the central role that the study of seed ecology has played in elucidating many fundamental aspects of plant community function.

TI  - Simple methods for calculating age-based life history parameters for stage-structured populations
PY  - 1992
AB  - Stage—classified matrix models are important analytical and theoretical tools for the study of population dynamics; in particular, these models may be appropriate for populations in which survivorship and fecundity are dependent on size or developmental stage, populations in which the age of individuals is difficult to determine, and populations in which there are multiple types of newborns. Nevertheless, methods for analyzing the implications of a population's stage—transition matrix have been limited in comparison to methods available for age—structured models (life tables or Leslie matrices). In this paper we show that all of the standard age—based measures of life history traits can be derived from a stage—transition model. By decomposing the transition matrix into separate birth, survival, and fission matrices we derive simple, direct formulas for age—based life history traits such as the discrete survivorship function, lx, maternity function, fx, mean age at maturity, and net reproductive rate, Ro, and also population parameters, including the stable age distribution, age—specific reproductive value, and generation time. These provide a common set of parameters for comparing age—structured and stage—structured populations or comparing populations with differently structured life cycles. In addition, we define four measures of age and life—span that summarize the relationship between stage and age in a stage—structured population: age distribution and mean age of residence for each stage class, expected remaining life—span for individuals in each stage class, and total life—span conditional on reaching a given stage class. We illustrate the use of our methods to address specific ecological questions by applying them to several previously published demographic data sets. These questions include: (1) what are the demographic effects of crowding on the tropical palm Astrocaryum mexicanum?; (2) how important is the initial rosette size in determining life history of teasel, Dipsacus sylvestris?; and (3) how old are reproducing adults in a stage—classified population of pink lady's—slipper, Cypripedium acaule? Our results may also be useful for evaluating the adequacy of a given stage—transition model.

TI  - Seed predation during general flowering events of varying magnitude in a Malaysian rain forest
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary


1
The lowland dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia exhibit interspecifically synchronized general flowering (GF) and mast fruiting at irregular multi-year intervals of 1 to 11 years. The predator satiation hypothesis (PSH) posits that GF events enhance seed survival by reducing the survival, reproduction and population sizes of seed predators between GF events, and then satiating the reduced seed predator populations during GF events.

2
Three GF events of different magnitudes occurred in Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, during 2001, 2002 and 2005. We exploited this natural experiment to test two predictions of the PSH. The first prediction was that seed survival should increase with the magnitude of the GF event. The second prediction was that seed predation should decrease with time since the previous GF event.

3
A reproductive survey of all (c. 900) dipterocarp trees  30 cm d.b.h. in a 50 ha plot showed that flowering pervasiveness (the proportion of dipterocarp species participating) was high and similar in all three GF events. However, relative flowering magnitudes (measured by an index of individual tree participation and flowering intensity in Shorea species) were 2, 5 and 8 for the 2001, 2002 and 2005 GF events, respectively.

4
The percentage of Shorea seeds surviving pre- and post-dispersal predation increased with the magnitude of GF events, which is consistent with the first prediction.

5
Pre-dispersal insect seed predators consumed 12.9%, 11.2% and 3.4% of Shorea seeds in the 2001, 2002 and 2005 GF events, respectively, which is consistent with both predictions.

6
Pre-dispersal seed predation by primates (mainly leaf monkeys) increased from 11.9% to 38.6% then fell to 9.3% in the 2001, 2002 and 2005 GF events, respectively.

7
Predator satiation occurred only at population and community levels. At the individual tree level there was no relationship between the percentage of seeds surviving pre- and post-dispersal seed predation and variation in seed crop size or seed density beneath the tree. This suggests that attempts to test the PSH on the scale of individual trees may miss key community level effects.

8
Our results suggest a more significant role of pre-dispersal seed predation in the evolution of reproductive synchrony than was recognized in the original statement of the PSH.

TI  - Resource allocation to reproductive organs during masting in the tropical emergent tree, Dipterocarpus tempehes
PY  - 2005
AB  - Some tree species exhibit large year-to-year variation in seed production, a phenomenon known as masting (Kelly 1994, Kelly & Sork 2002). Even in tropical rain forests, in which the climate is suitable for plant growth all year round with little seasonal variation (Whitmore 1998), there are many reports of masting (Appanah 1993, Hart 1995, Newbery et al. 1998, Newstrom et al. 1994, Wheelwright 1986). In particular, Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant family in lowland mixed dipterocarp forests in South-East Asia, undergo mast fruiting following mass-flowering with strong interspecific synchronization in aseasonal western Malesia (Appanah 1985, 1993; Ashton 1989, Ashton et al. 1988, Curran et al. 1999, Janzen 1974, Medway 1972, Sakai et al. 1999, Whitmore 1998, Wood 1956). In mixed-dipterocarp forests, dipterocarp species contribute more than 70% of the canopy biomass (Bruenig 1996, Curran & Leighton 2000). Masting of dipterocarp species is therefore likely to have a major impact on animal populations, and also on the nutrient cycle in such forest ecosystems by causing fluctuations in the availability of resources (Sakai 2002).

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL TESTS OF THE SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALE OF SEED PREDATION IN MAST‐FRUITING DIPTEROCARPACEAE
PY  - 2000
AB  - Mast-fruiting Dipterocarpaceae exhibit highly synchronous, interspecific seedfall at irregular, multiyear intervals. To investigate how the temporal pattern of seedfall affects dipterocarp seed and seedling survival, in both a logged and a primary lowland tropical forest, we planted Shorea stenoptera Burck seeds in the last three weeks of a 12- wk synchronous dipterocarp seedfall during a major community mast-fruiting event in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. As a result of commercial timber harvest of dipterocarp individuals eight years before, total dipterocarp seed production in the logged site was only 23% of that in the primary forest. At both sites, an average of 35 kg of seed was sown across a large area (?1 kM2) to examine the spatial pattern of seed destruction. During the period in which "natural" community mast seed was available to predators, 92% and 99% of experimentally sown seed escaped predators in logged and in primary forest, respectively. After regional seed resources were exhausted, nomadic vertebrates (primarily the bearded pig, Sus barbatus) were observed in both forest areas, and all ungerminated seed was destroyed. Seed predators arrived earlier in the logged area, before most experimentally sown seed had germinated, and the logged site experienced greater seed loss to vertebrates than did the primary forest. Because nomadic seed predators were absent during peak fruit fall of naturally occurring communities at both study sites, there was no evidence of local predator satiation. Rather, experimentally sown seed escaped predation because of rapid germination before predator arrival, as opposed to being ignored by satiated predators. Seed escape was more dependent on the late arrival of pigs than on the amount of local seed production. There was no significant spatial autocorrelation of seed predation. All remaining seed at the scale of the experiment (>1 kM2) was destroyed by predators. These findings suggest that satiation of nomadic predators occurs at the landscape scale. Postdispersal seed predators caused significantly greater seed destruction in the exper- imentally sown seed populations than in naturally dispersed, mast-fruiting communities at both sites. In both logged and primary forests, there was significantly greater loss of experimentally sown seed to predation than was found in the entire natural mast-fruiting Shorea community combined (21 spp.). Moreover, a naturally occurring, but late-fruiting, Shorea species also exhibited greater seed losses to predation than did all other species within each mast-fruiting community, and these proportional losses were similar to those observed in the experimentally sown seeds. Seeds that escaped predation and vertebrate herbivory on post-establishment seedlings dis- played high survival, indicating that the availability of suitable microsites did not limit re- cruitment. In the primary forest, 65% of the germinated experimental seed that survived early causes of mortality was alive 40 mo post-planting, which coincided with the next mast-fruiting event. The spatial distribution of these seedlings was modified primarily by the foraging behavior of vertebrate seed predators in the first two weeks post-planting. The influence of vertebrate predation on seed and seedling survival suggests that foraging behavior by terrestrial vertebrate seed predators may cause directional and/or stabilizing selection for synchronous, interspecific supra-annual dipterocarp seed production across forest regions in Kalimantan.

TI  - Ecology of Seed Dispersal
PY  - 1982
AB  - Identification of the selective forces on plant dispersal engenders theoretical argument, empirical study, and speculation. We separate evidence, testable hypotheses, and conjecture surrounding two major questions in dispersal ecology. The first asks what ecological, and ultimately evolutionary, advantages exist in seed dispersal. Astonishingly little is known about the advantages to a parent plant that are actually conferred by investment in dispersal structures. Does dispersal enable seeds and ultimately seedlings to escape mortality near the parent? Is continual recolonization of unstable habitats the primary advantage? Must seeds find rare microhabitats suitable for reestablishment? Such issues are addressed through joint consideration of dispersal and establishment-those stages both mediated by parental provisioning and subject to the highest mortality in the life of a plant. The second broad question asks what general and explicit environmental forces influence the timing and mode of dispersal. Do climates or seasons favor one dispersal mode over another? Do differences in number, size, morphology, or nutritional quality of fruits influence frugivore choice, and consequently differential dispersal of species or individuals within species? Studies of dispersal process and mode should be intimately connected. A general objective of this paper is to explore the degree to which they are integrated and, in so doing, to catalyze their union. We emphasize topics most in need of critical attention: the evolutionary ecology of dispersal process and mode. Excellent recent reviews consider such related topics as dispersal mechanism (131, 184), seed dormancy (1, 30), phytogeography (11, 115, 146), masting and predator satiation (105, 156), and succession (68, 69, 189).

TI  - The impact of El Niño on mast fruiting in Sumatra and elsewhere in Malesia.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Long-term data on flower and fruit production of the forest commun- ity in two lowland tropical rain forests in north-western Sumatra are presented. The proportion of years with mast fruiting was found to be similar to that found elsewhere in Malesia. However, masting at the two sites, 70 km apart, did not coincide, and showed no correlation with the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation phe- nomenon (ENSO). Comparisons with other sites in Malesia suggest a general waning of ENSO's impact toward western Malesia. Spatial variation at various scales in the timing of masting events was noted in Sumatra and elsewhere. This suggests that additional factors to ENSO play a role in determining forest-level mast fruiting, and we hypothesize that frugivorous animals have the opportunity to track mast fruiting. It is hypothesized that asynchrony between nearby areas in masting increases toward the western edge of Malesia.

TI  - Integral Projection Models for trees: a new parameterization method and a validation of model output
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Matrix models are popular tools for plant demographic studies, but their application to long-lived, slow-growing species is hampered by the fact that (i) model output is highly sensitive to category width and (ii) growth variation between individuals can only be partially accounted for. Integral Projection Models (IPMs) – an extension of matrix models – offer a solution to these problems. 2. Here, we introduce a new method to parameterize IPMs for trees – the ‘integration method’ – which allows constructing IPMs for long-lived, slow-growing species. This approach is more suitable than the ‘midpoint rule’, which is customarily used. 3. We built IPMs for six tree species from Vietnamese (sub)tropical forests. For four of these species, population growth rate (k) was highly sensitive to the number of categories in the transition matrix. Population growth stabilized for IPMs with 100–1000 categories, corresponding to categories of 0.1–1 cm in trunk diameter. This preferred width is much narrower than the 10-cm-wide categories customarily used in tree models. 4. The distribution of elasticity values over transition types (stasis, progression to next and further categories) is also highly sensitive to matrix dimension in IPMs. In addition, elasticity distribution is influenced by including or excluding growth variation. 5. Age estimates obtained from IPMs were also highly sensitive to matrix dimension: an IPM with 1000 size categories yielded 2–4 times higher age estimates for large trees than one with 10 size categories. Observed ages obtained from tree ring analyses for four of the study species allowed validating these estimates. IPMs with 10 categories strongly underestimated age, while those with 1000 categories yielded slight age overestimates. Underestimating age in small matrices is caused by the occurrence of unrealistically fast pathways through the life cycle and is probably widespread among tree models with broad categories. Overestimating ages in IPMs with narrow categories may be due to temporally autocorrelated growth or errors in fitting growth curves. 6. Synthesis. IPMs are highly suitable tools to analyse tree demography. We recommend that tree IPMs (and classical matrix models) apply narrow diameter categories (0.1–1 cm width) to obtain reliable model output.

TI  - Spatial Dynamics of Specialist Seed Predators on Synchronized and Intermittent Seed Production of Host Plants
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract: Masting, the synchronized and intermittent seed production by plant populations, provides highly variable food resources for specialist seed predators. Such a reproductive mode helps minimize seed losses through predator satiation and extinction of seed predator populations. The seed predators can buffer the resource variation through dispersal or extended diapause. We developed a spatially explicit resource‐consumer model to understand the effect of masting on specialist seed predators. The masting dynamics were assumed to follow a resource‐based model for plant reproduction, and the population dynamics of the predator were represented by a spatially extended Nicholson‐Bailey model. The resultant model demonstrated that when host plants reproduce intermittently, seed predator populations go locally extinct, but global persistence of the predator is facilitated by dispersal or extended diapause. Global extinction of the predator resulted when the intermittent reproduction is highly synchronized ...

TI  - Impact of El Nino and logging on canopy tree recruitment in borneo
PY  - 1999
AB  - Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant family of Bornean canopy trees, display the unusual reproductive strategy of strict interspecific mast-fruiting. During 1986–99, more than 50 dipterocarp species dispersed seed only within a 1- to 2-month period every 3 to 4 years during El Nino–Southern Oscillation events. Synchronous seed production occurred across extensive areas and was essential for satiating seed predators. Logging of dipterocarps reduced the extent and intensity of these reproductive episodes and exacerbated local El Nino conditions. Viable seed and seedling establishment have declined as a result of climate, logging, and predators. Since 1991, dipterocarps have experienced recruitment failure within a national park, now surrounded by logged forest.

TI  - Demography of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) in the Bolivian Amazon: impact of seed extraction on recruitment and population dynamics
PY  - 2002
AB  - A demographic study was carried out on Bertholletia excelsa, the Brazil nut tree, in two primary forest sites in Northern Bolivia where Brazil nuts have been harvested for several decades. In spite of the large proportion (93%) of seeds that are harvested, reasonable densities of recently emerged seedlings were found. Seeds of Bertholletia are contained in woody fruits that are primarily opened by agoutis. Most fruits are left untouched on the forest floor for 1-2 y before they are opened, possibly due to high energetic costs of fruit opening just after fruit fall. However, the proportion of viable seeds is strongly reduced in older fruits. Growth in diameter at breast height (dbh) was low for pole-sized trees ( 100 cm dbh) and peaked for intermediate-sized trees (30-60 cm). These trees often attained a growth rate of > 1.5 cm y −1 , which is high compared with other non-pioneer tropical trees. This, and the strong growth response to increased light availability found for seedlings and saplings, suggest that Bertholletia excelsa can be classified as a gap-dependent species. Matrix popula- tion models were constructed for both study populations. Population growth rates (λ) were close to one, and were most sensitive to persistence in one size category. Age estimates revealed that age at first reproduction (at dbh > 60 cm) amounts to over 120 y, and age in the last category (dbh > 160 cm) to almost 300 y. Given the continuous rejuvenation of the population, the stable population size, the high age at maturity and the long reproductive period, it is concluded that current levels of Brazil nut extraction may be sustained at least for several decades and perhaps for even longer periods.

Les parcelles de G2 ont une surface terriere residuelle variant entre 70 et 79 % de l'originale (intensite moyenne = 8 arbres ha -1 ). Enfin G3 regroupe des parcelles fortement perturbees avec une surface terriere inferieure a 70 % de l'originale et ayant subi une intensite d'exploitation beaucoup plus elevee (14 arbres ha -1 ). Les durees moyennes de rotation dans les trois groupes sont significativement differentes et s'elevent a 27, 41 et 89 ans respectivement dans G1, G2 et G 3. Cependant, les volumes annuels preleves sont statistiquement similaires: 1.6, 1.8 et 1.4 m 3 ha -1 an -1 , respectivement dans G1, G2 et G3. Le modele suggere qu'un cycle de 40 ans, avec une extraction moyenne de 8 arbres ha -1 (60 m 3 ha -1 ) et un volume annuel preleve de 1.5 m 3 ha -1 an -1 constitue la meilleure option permettant d'assurer l'integrite ecologique de la foret, ainsi qu'une production constante et, selon les etudes de couts existantes, economiquement rentable sur le long terme. Ce resultat conforte par ailleurs les etudes precedentes ayant demontre que les degâts d'exploitation ne pouvaient etre reduits de facon significative grâce a l'EFI (exploitation a faible impact) qu'a condition de limiter l'intensite d'extraction a 8 arbres ha -1 . Des regles simples permettent de respecter cette intensite.

TI  - Seed predation by Neotropical rain forest mammals increases diversity in seedling recruitment.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Seed dispersal and seedling recruitment (the transition of seeds to seedlings) set the spatiotemporal distribution of new individuals in plant communities. Many terrestrial rain forest mammals consume post-dispersal seeds and seedlings, often inflicting density-dependent mortality. In part because of density-dependent mortality, diversity often increases during seedling recruitment, making it a critical stage for species coexistence. We determined how mammalian predators, adult tree abundance, and seed mass interact to affect seedling recruitment in a western Amazonian rain forest. We used exclosures that were selectively permeable to three size classes of mammals: mice and spiny rats (weighing <1 kg), medium-sized rodents (1-12 kg), and large mammals (20-200 kg). Into each exclosure, we placed seeds of 13 tree species and one canopy liana, which varied by an order of magnitude in adult abundance and seed mass. We followed the fates of the seeds and resulting seedlings for at least 17 months. We assessed the effect of each mammalian size class on seed survival, seedling survival and growth, and the density and diversity of the seedlings that survived to the end of the experiment. Surprisingly, large mammals had no detectable effect at any stage of seedling recruitment. In contrast, small- and medium-sized mammals significantly reduced seed survival, seedling survival, and seedling density. Furthermore, predation by small mammals increased species richness on a per-stem basis. This increase in diversity resulted from their disproportionately intense predation on common species and large-seeded species. Small mammals thereby generated a rare-species advantage in seedling recruitment, the critical ingredient for frequency dependence. Predation by small (and to a lesser extent, medium-sized) mammals on seeds and seedlings significantly increases tree species diversity in tropical forests. This is the first long-term study to dissect the effects of various mammalian predators on the recruitment of a diverse set of tree species.

TI  - Microhabitat associations and seedling bank dynamics in a neotropical forest
PY  - 2004
AB  - We conducted a rigorous test of tropical tree seedling microhabitat differentiation by examining microhabitat associations, survival and growth of established seedlings of ten tropical tree species representing a four-factor gradient in seed size. Eight microhabitat variables describing soil and light conditions were measured directly adjacent to each of 588 seedlings within twelve 10×100 m belt transects at Paracou, French Guiana, and at 264 reference points along the transects. From these measurements, we defined three principal components describing soil richness, soil softness and canopy openness. Six of ten species (in 9 of 30 total cases) were distributed non-randomly with respect to microhabitat along at least one principal component. However, few species demonstrated clear microhabitat specialization. All shifts in distribution relative to reference points were in the same direction (richer, softer soil). Furthermore, of 135 pairwise comparisons among the species, only 7 were significantly different. More than three-fourths of all seedlings (75.3%) survived over the 2-year monitoring period, but survival rates varied widely among species. In no case was the probability of survival influenced by any microhabitat parameter. Relative height growth rates for the seedlings over 2 years varied from -0.031 cm cm-1 year-1 (Dicorynia guianensis, Caesalpiniaceae) to 0.088 cm cm-1 year-1 (Virola michelii, Myristicaceae). In only 4 of 30 cases was height growth significantly associated with one of the three principal components. Because the conditions in this study were designed to maximize the chance of finding microhabitat differentiation among a group of species differing greatly in life history traits, the lack of microhabitat specialization it uncovered suggests that microhabitat partitioning among tropical tree species at the established seedling stage is unlikely to contribute greatly to coexistence among these species.

TI  - Temporal and spatial patterns of mass flowerings on the Malay Peninsula
PY  - 2003
AB  - We propose a hypothesis to explain the temporal and spatial patterns of mass flowerings in dipterocarp tree species on the Malay Peninsula. The literature on these mass flowerings reveals that during 1980‐2002 at least 11 flowerings occurred at irregular intervals of 1‐6 yr in a lowland rain forest. Five of them were typical mass flowerings—a high density of flowering trees and the characteristic sequential flowering of Shorea species. The 11 flowerings were classified into two flowering times: spring and autumn. There is evidence that low temperature and drought triggered the flowerings. Therefore, the seasonality of mass flowerings is characterized by

TI  - The dynamics of tree populations in tropical forest: a review.
PY  - 1987
AB  - Published work on the dynamics of forest tree recruitment, growth and mortality in natural tropical forest is reviewed. In most forests studied, annual mortality is between 1% and 2% and is independent of size class in trees >10 cm dbh; mortality is negatively correlated with growth rate and crown illumination; growth rate is highly variable between individual trees, but shows strong autocorrelation between successive measurements on the same tree. Differences in the rate of dynamic processes can be detected between some species at a site, but data are presently insufficient to determine whether these differences are preserved at other sites where the species occur. None of the studies discussed are of sufficient duration to permit us to draw any conclusions about the equilibrium or non-equilibrium of floristic composition.

TI  - Long-term reproductive behaviour of woody plants across seven Bornean forest types in the Gunung Palung National Park (Indonesia): suprannual synchrony, temporal productivity and fruiting diversity.
PY  - 2007
AB  - For 68 months, we observed the reproductive behaviour of 7288 woody plants (172 figs, 1457 climbers and 5659 trees) spanning major soil and elevational gradients. Two 2‐3 month community-wide supra-annual fruiting events were synchronized across five forest types, coinciding with ENSO events. At least 27 genera in 24 families restricted their reproduction to these events, which involved a substantial proportion of tree diversity (> 80% of phylogenetic diversity). During these events, mean reproductive levels (8.5%) represented an almost four-fold increase compared with other months. These patterns indicate a strong behavioural advantage to this unusual reproductive behaviour. Montane forest experienced a single, separate fruiting peak while the peat swamp forest did not participate. Excluding these events, no temporal reproductive pattern was detectible, at either the landscape or forest type. These phenological patterns have major implications for the conservation of frugivore communities, with montane and swamp forests acting as keystone forests.

TI  - General flowering in the climax rain forests of South-east Asia
PY  - 1985
AB  - The general flowering of lowland dipterocarp forests of South-east Asia is a unique phenomenon that occurs intermittently, sometimes many years apart, and may be widespread throughout the region or sporadic. During a general flowering a very large number of tree families, including the well-known Dipterocarpaceae, flower and fruit exceptionally heavily. The huge pulse of flowering is echoed by an apparent explosion in the number of pollinators, and this is further augmented by migration of pollinators from the forest fringes. The huge demand for pollinators seems to be solved among several dipterocarps through utilization of tiny, fast breeding, floral-feeding insects such as thrips and hoppers. Competition for pollinators is further reduced through development of sequential flowering among several groups of trees that share similar pollinators. The resulting massive general fruiting seems to contribute to a heightened level of faunal activity and numbers. This long-intervalled flowering and fruiting phenology which dominates these lowland dipterocarp forests may have partly contributed to the lowered animal biomass frequently alluded to when these forests are compared with neotropical forests.

TI  - Chain reactions linking acorns to gypsy moth outbreaks and Lyme disease risk.
PY  - 1998
AB  - In eastern U.S. oak forests, defoliation by gypsy moths and the risk of Lyme disease are determined by interactions among acorns, white-footed mice, moths, deer, and ticks. Experimental removal of mice, which eat moth pupae, demonstrated that moth outbreaks are caused by reductions in mouse density that occur when there are no acorns. Experimental acorn addition increased mouse density. Acorn addition also increased densities of black-legged ticks, evidently by attracting deer, which are key tick hosts. Mice are primarily responsible for infecting ticks with the Lyme disease agent. The results have important implications for predicting and managing forest health and human health.

TI  - Directed seed dispersal by bellbirds in a tropical cloud forest
PY  - 1998
AB  - A fundamental goal of plant population ecology is to understand the consequences for plant fitness of seed dispersal by animals. Theories of seed dispersal and tropical forest regeneration suggest that the advantages of seed dispersal for most plants are escape from seed predation near the parent tree and colonization of vacant sites, the locations of which are unpredictable in space and time. Some plants may gain in fitness as a fortuitous consequence of disperser behavior if certain species of dispersers nonrandomly place seeds in sites predictably favorable for seedling establishment. Such patterns of directed dispersal by vertebrates long have been suggested but never demonstrated for tropical forest trees. Here we report the pattern of seed distribution and 1-year seedling survival generated by five species of birds for a neotropical, shade-tolerant tree. Four of the species dispersed seeds to sites near the parent trees with microhabitat characteristics similar to those at random locations, whereas the fifth species, a bellbird, predictably dispersed seeds under song perches in canopy gaps. The pattern of seedling recruitment was bimodal, with a peak near parent trees and a second peak, corresponding to bellbird song perches, far (>40 m) from parent trees. Seedling survival was higher for seeds dispersed by bellbirds than by the other species, because of a reduction in seedling mortality by fungal pathogens in gaps. Thus, bellbirds play a significant role in seed dispersal by providing directed dispersal to favorable sites and therefore may influence plant recruitment patterns and species diversity in Neotropical forests.

TI  - DIPTEROCARP BIOLOGY AS A WINDOW TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF TROPICAL FOREST STRUCTURE
PY  - 1988
AB  - My aim is to show, by one example, why systematics must provide a foundation equal to that of ecology if the structure of tropical forests, and particularly their floristic structure and often extraordinary species richness, is to be understood. Species composition accounts for much of the geographical variation in structure that occurs among forests in different regions sharing the same habitat. Our knowledge of rain forest structure has advanced from the description of whole plant communities, or often their tree component alone, to a contemporary interest in the demography and genetics of species populations, and to the physiological ecology of individuals. Always, though, systematic as well as ecological relationships must be understood if this knowledge is to contribute to understanding of the structure of the whole forest. The biological attributes shared among the individuals of species, and which decide their success in interspecific competition, determine both the ecological guild to which they belong and, in part, their systematic relationships. Systematics aims to classify species into a hierarchy of categories of increasing rank. The hierarchy is aimed to reflect evolutionary relationships, and it thereby provides inferential evidence for the origin of the major species groups constituting tropical rain forest communities. I argue that an understanding of the floristic structure of tropical forests, and more

TI  - Effects of canopy openings on tree seed germination in a Malaysian dipterocarp forest
PY  - 1990
AB  - The germination of 43 tree species native to the lowland forests of Malaysia was monitored on forest soil in trays placed in closed-canopy forest, an artificial forest gap, and a large clearing. Germination varied significantly among habitats, with only seven species germinating well in all three sites. Seed germination of most species demonstrated clear patterns of shade tolerance or intolerance identical to those long recognized for tree seedlings. Favoured locations for germination were similar to known distributional patterns of adult individuals in mature and secondary forests. Most forest canopy species germinated in the gap, but germination in the large clearing was dramatically reduced or nil; the regeneration of these species in large clearings will be severely retarded even when seeds are present. Canopy-induced inhibition of germination was apparent in several pioneer species; seeds moved from the forest into the gap or clearing germinated rapidly. Results indicate that natural treefall gaps do not inhibit the germination of most species, but do allow pioneer species to germinate, and therefore regenerate. Although germination occurred in all three locations, the level of germination for particular species varied greatly among habitats. We conclude that germination requirements play a very important role in controlling the species composition of regeneration in forest understorey, gap, and large clearing habitats.

AB  - Tropical rainforest plants produce seeds showing a wide range of sizes, shapes, structures, chemical composition, water content, dormancy mechanisms, and patterns of longevity. Prompt germination seems to be the most common behavior, although there are many cases where germination is delayed by a hard coat or endogenous or enforced dormancy mechanisms. Some gap colonizers show sophisticated light or temperature regulated dormancy. Most rainforest seeds remain alive for a short time in the soil, even those that form part of the soil seed bank.

The similarities and differences in hoarding behaviour between the two species are presented, and the seed fate from the moment acorns ripen on the tree until the shoot appears from the germinated seed is compared. The impact of both species on oak populations in different habitats and landscapes are evaluated. Data from a number of field experiments that investigated the effects of structural characteristics of the habitat on seed dispersal and predation by rodents are also presented.

TI  - Competition for dispersers, and the timing of flowering and fruiting in a guild of tropical trees
PY  - 1985
AB  - One conceivable outcome of competition for a limited number of pollinators or seed dispersers is the evolution of minimally overlapping flowering or fruiting seasons. In the lower montane forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica, a study of 23 tree species (Lauraceae) that share avian seed dispersers and insect pollinators found little evidence for such phenological character displacement. The distribution of flowering phenologies appeared random but were indistinguishable from a uniform sequence; fruiting seasons were more aggregated and were significantly non-uniform. Nonetheless, ecological competition for seed dispersers apparently does occur because fruit removal rates decline when many species fruit concurrently. Neither intraspecific variance in phenologies nor duration of flowering or fruiting within species was correlated with interspecific competition for dispersers. Final fruit weight at maturity explained only about a quarter of the variance in developmental times between species. The absence of overdispersed phenologies cannot exclude the possibility that competition exists or that phenological character displacement has occurred. Uniformly distributed phenologies have been reported more frequently for flowering than for fruiting. Because flowering plants face reproductive as well as ecological competition, I hypothesize that selection may be stronger for the divergence of flowering times than for fruiting times, especially within guilds of related species.

TI  - Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests
PY  - 1970
AB  - A high number of tree species, low density of adults of each species, and long distances between conspecific adults are characteristic of many low-land tropical forest habitats. I propose that these three traits, in large part, are the result of the action of predators on seeds and seedlings. A model is presented that allows detailed examination of the effect of different predators, dispersal agents, seed-crop sizes, etc. on these three traits. In short, any event that increases the efficiency of the predators at eating seeds and seedlings of a given tree species may lead to a reduction in population density of the adults of that species and/or to increased distance between new adults and their parents. Either event will lead to more space in the habitat for other species of trees, and therefore higher total number of tree species, provided seed sources are available over evolutionary time. As one moves from the wet lowland tropics to the dry tropics or temperate zones, the seed and seedling predators in ...

TI  - The Ecology and Economics of Storage in Plants
PY  - 1990
AB  - Storage is a characteristic feature of most plants, particularly perennials, and the subject has been thoroughly reviewed according to its chemistry and physiology (9, 40, 59, 80, 133, 139). However, in ecology much of the information on storage is based on observation rather than experimentation, and experiments often fail to confirm common perceptions of the nature and dynamics of stored reserves. For example, clipping studies show that not all carbohydrates are available to the plant, even though they are considered to be stored reserves. In this review we suggest criteria for defining storage in ecological and eonomic contexts in order to examine the costs and benefits of storage. We then evaluate the evidence for, and ecological importance of, different types of storage. We discuss storage in relation to vegetative growth

TI  - Mortality Rates of 205 Neotropical Tree and Shrub Species and the Impact of a Severe Drought
PY  - 1995
AB  - Mortality rates of 205 tree and shrub species were estimated during two intervals, 1982-1985 and 1985-1990, in two size classes, 1-10 and ?10 cm in diameter, in a 50-ha census plot in tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. The severe dry season of 1983 was the focus of the study, since prior observations had dem- onstrated that it caused mortality in the forest. Here we document that forest-wide mortality was z3%/yr during the drought interval but only 2%/yr during the period afterwards, and that excess mortality during the first interval amounted to 2% of stems in the larger size class and 1% in the smaller. Overall, just under 70% of all species had higher mortality during the first census interval, but not all species were equally affected. Canopy trees had significantly higher mean mortality rates during 1982-1985 than during 1985-1990, but treelets and shrubs showed no or slight differences. This was counter to our prediction that species with short root systems would suffer more from a long drought. Shrubs did, however, have higher mortality rates than trees and treelets during both census intervals. We also evaluated mortality rates for subgroups of species that specialized on different microhabitats in the forest. As we predicted, colonist species (those associated with light gaps) had higher mortality rates than generalist species, 7-10%/yr compared to 2-4%/yr, but only in the smaller size class. Unexpectedly, colonizers had similar mortality rates as non-colonizers in the larger size class. Gap colonizers and generalist species were similarly affected by the drought-both had elevated mortality during 1982-1985. Species whose distributions were associated with moister soils (on the slopes around the island's plateau or in a swamp in the midst of the 50-ha plot) also had elevated mortality during the drought period, but no more so than generalist species. This was counter to our prediction that species from moist microhabitats would suffer more during an extended drought than generalists. Understory treelets that were slope specialists had higher mortality than generalists during both census intervals, but not large trees that were slope specialists. Our conclusions emphasize diversity as well as pattern. Every trend we illustrated had well-documented exceptions: large trees with lower mortality during the drought period, for example. Clearly, accurate predictions about how tropical forests will respond to climatic perturbations will require much detailed information from many species.

TI  - Predispersal seed predation by insects vs. vertebrates in six dipterocarp species in Sarawak, Malaysia.
PY  - 2005
AB  - We investigated the predispersal survivorship of seeds of six dipterocarp species (Dipterocarpus globosus, D. tempehes, Dryobalanops aromatica, D. lanceolata, Shorea beccariana ,a ndS. pilosa) during 2001–2002, when a general flowering occurred in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. More immature seeds dropped during the first month in Dryobalanops and Shorea spp. than in Dipterocarpus spp. Insects attacked the seeds of all species during all developmental stages through to maturity, although temporal patterns varied among the dipterocarps. In contrast, arboreal vertebrates only occasionally ate seeds, and produced less damage than insects. In four species, insects damaged a significantly higher percentage of seeds than did vertebrates. Direct observations of seed survival patterns and bagging experiments using two sizes of mesh (cloth and wire) in the canopy of Dryobalanops aromatica identified insects as the principal seed predators during both the last phase, and overall. These results document the relative importance of insects as predispersal seed predators in these dipterocarp species.

TI  - CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MAST SEED PRODUCTION OF FOUR CO‐OCCURRING CARPINUS SPECIES IN JAPAN
PY  - 1998
AB  - To test two hypotheses for mast fruiting, i.e., (1) pollination efficiency and (2) pre-dispersal predator satiation, we investigated annual fluctuation in seed production and demography from flower to seed of four Carpinus species (family Betulaceae). We monitored flowering, seed production, and seed fall for seven years (1987-1993) for Car- pinus laxiflora, C. tschonoskii, C. japonica, and C. cordata, which co-occur in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. We also monitored the seasonal development of pistillate aments in 1995. These Carpinus species are known to show highly synchronized, fluctuating annual seed production. Total seed production (the sum of sound seeds, seeds suffering predation, empty seeds, and immature seeds) was proportional to the quantity of staminate aments and was synchronized among the four species during the observation period. The percentage of mature seeds (the sum of sound seeds and seeds suffering predation) out of the total seed production was positively correlated with annual staminate ament production. This result supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The observation that most ovaries in this study did not fall after the pollination season and grew into normal, mature-sized seeds irrespective of fertilization (empty or not) also sup- ports the hypothesis. The percentage of seeds suffering predation by insects significantly decreased in relation to sound seed production, suggesting that predator satiation also operated for these Carpinus species. If the four species have common seed predators (pos- sibly some curculionid species), mutually synchronized fluctuation of seed production among them would be effective for escaping from pre-dispersal predation.

TI  - A hierarchical set of models for species response analysis
PY  - 1993
AB  - Variation in the abundance of species in space and/ or time can be caused by a wide range of underlying processes. Before such causes can be analysed we need simple math- ematical models which can describe the observed response patterns. For this purpose a hierarchical set of models is presented. These models are applicable to positive data with an upper bound, like relative frequencies and percentages. The models are fitted to the observations by means of logistic and non-linear regression techniques. Working with models of increasing complexity allows us to choose for the simplest possible model which sufficiently explains the observed pat- tern. The models are particularly suited for description of responses in time or over major environmental gradients. Deviations from these temporal or spatial trends may be statistically ascribed to, for example, climatic fluctuations or small-scale spatial heterogeneity. The applicability of this approach is illustrated by examples from recent research. A combination of simple, descriptive models like those pre- sented in this paper and causal models as developed by several others, is advocated as a powerful tool towards a fuller under- standing of the dynamics and patterns of vegetational change.

TI  - Chemical defences of fruits and mast-fruiting of dipterocarps
PY  - 1999
AB  - Mast-fruiting is the intermittent and synchronous production of large fruits
 by a population of plants at long intervals (Herrera et al. 1998, Kelly 1994).
 Several hypotheses have been proposed concerning the adaptive advantages of
 mast-fruiting (Janzen 1971, 1974; Kelly 1994), and some field observations have
 provided evidence for these hypotheses (Norton & Kelly 1988, Shibata et al. 1998, Sork 1993). The predator-satiation hypothesis is one well-known explanation for reproductive synchrony in plants and animals (Janzen 1971, 1974; Kelly
 1994). This hypothesis claims that mast fruiting at irregular intervals of several
 years is an effective means of satiating vertebrate fruit predators: low seed
 production can only support low densities of predators during the periods
 between mast-fruiting events, but more fruits are produced than predators can
 consume in masting years (Janzen 1971, Kelly 1994). Thus, it may be said that
 mast-fruiting is a defence strategy of plants against post-dispersal vertebrate
 fruit predators.

TI  - The components of prédation as revealed by a study of small-mammal prédation of the European pine sawfly.
PY  - 1959
AB  - The fluctuation of an animal's numbers between restricted limits is determined by a balance between that animal's capacity to increase and the environmenta1 cheks to this increase. Many authors have indulged in the calculating the propressive increase of a population when no checks nrerc operating. Thus Huxley calculated that the progeny of a single Aphis in the course of 10 generations, supposing all survived,would “contain more ponderable substance than five hundred millions of stout men; that is, more than the whole population of China”, (in Thompson, 1929). Checks, however, do occur and it has been the subject of much controversy to determine how these checks operate. Certain general principles—the density-dependence concept of Smith ( 1955) , the competition theory of Nicholson (1933)—have been proposed both verbally and mathematically, but because they have been based in part upon untested and restrictive assumptions they have been severelv criticized (e.g. Andrewartha and Birch 1954). These problems could be considerably clarified if we knew the mode of operation of each process that affects numbers, if we knew its basic and subsidiary components. predation, one such process, forms the subject of the present paper.

TI  - CAUSES OF SYNCHRONOUS FLOWERING IN ASTRAGALUS SCAPHOIDES, AN ITEROPAROUS PERENNIAL PLANT
PY  - 2004
AB  - Many plant populations reproduce synchronously over time. Hypotheses to explain reproductive synchrony have typically been based on evolutionary advantages of synchrony, such as increased pollination or decreased predation with increasing numbers of flowering plants, often referred to as economies of scale. We tested for decreased herbivory, increased fruit set, and decreased predation as evolutionary mechanisms driving synchronous reproduction in an iteroparous perennial plant, Astragalus scaphoides, at three semiarid sagebrush steppe sites in intermountain valleys of Idaho and Montana, USA. Reproduction was synchronous at all sites and significantly bimodal at two sites, but it was never as variable as distinctly mast-seeding plant species. Plants in all populations experienced at least one economy of scale: decreased inflorescence herbivory, increased fruit set, and/or decreased weevil seed predation with increasing flowering plant density. At two of three sites, these relationships were strong enough to increase expected geometric mean seed set. However, among-site differences in benefits and strength of synchrony were not concordant. In particular, the site with the strongest economy of scale and highest coefficient of variation (cv) was the least bimodal. We suggest that different mechanisms drive cv and bimodality in this species, both of which contribute to overall synchrony. In addition to reflecting direct fitness benefits, synchrony may be at least partly an indirect consequence of individual-level reproductive constraints. Recent models have demonstrated that individual-level constraints can make bimodal, alternate-year flowering likely.

TI  - The Ecology of Seeds
PY  - 2005
AB  - <jats:p>What determines the number and size of the seeds produced by a plant? How often should it reproduce them? How often should a plant produce them? Why and how are seeds dispersed, and what are the implications for the diversity and composition of vegetation? These are just some of the questions tackled in this wide-ranging review of the role of seeds in the ecology of plants. The authors bring together information on the ecological aspects of seed biology, starting with a consideration of reproductive strategies in seed plants and progressing through the life cycle, covering seed maturation, dispersal, storage in the soil, dormancy, germination, seedling establishment, and regeneration in the field. The text encompasses a wide range of concepts of general relevance to plant ecology, reflecting the central role that the study of seed ecology has played in elucidating many fundamental aspects of plant community function.</jats:p>

TI  - Beetle pollination of Shorea parvifolia (section Mutica, Dipterocarpaceae) in a general flowering period in Sarawak, Malaysia
PY  - 1999
AB  - Pollination ecology of an emergent tree species, Shorea (section Mutica) parvifolia (Dipterocarpaceae), was studied using the canopy observation system in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia, during a general flowering period in 1996. Although the species has been reported to be pollinated by thrips in Peninsular Malaysia, our observations of flower visitors and pollination experiments indicated that beetles (Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae, Coleoptera) contributed to pollination of S. parvifolia in Sarawak. Beetles accounted for 74% of the flower visitors collected by net-sweeping, and 30% of the beetles carried pollen, while thrips accounted for 16% of the visitors, and 12% of the thrips carried pollen. The apical parts of the petals and pollen served as a reward for the beetles. Thrips stayed inside the flower almost continuously after arrival, and movements among flowers were rare. Fruit set was significantly increased by introduction of beetles to bagged flowers, but not by introduction of thrips. Hand-pollination experiments and comparison of fruit set in untreated, bagged, and open flowers suggested that S. parvifolia was mainly outbreeding.

TI  - Reproduction of dipterocarps during low intensity masting events in a Bornean rain forest
PY  - 2005
AB  - Question: The evolution of general flowering and mast fruiting of dipterocarps in tropical rain forest has been explained by different mechanisms. We studied whether the abundance of flowering conspecifics influences the recruitment success of tropical forest trees in Borneo. Location: Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia. Method: We examined the recruitment success of 17 species of Dipterocarpaceae in a 640-ha sample area over two flowering events in 2001-2002 using seed traps and quadrats. Seed predation experiments were used to investigate if post-dispersal seed survival was density-dependent. Results: We found a negative relationship between the percentage of flowers abscised per individual and the number of flowering conspecifics and a positive relationship between the percent of flowering trees that produced viable seeds and the number of flowering conspecifics. However, we found no evidence of decreasing pre- and post-dispersal predation with increasing numbers of flowering conspecifics. High levels of flower abscission, and pre- and post-dispersal seed mortality, resulted in near-complete recruitment failure of most species, with only three species successfully recruiting in only one year. One of these, Parashorea tomentella, satiated seed predators over a large area, while Hopea beccariana and Shorea multiflora only recruited in small isolated clumps. Seed predation experiments suggest that post-dispersal seed survival was positively density-dependent in the short-term. Conclusions: Increased density of flowering conspecifics may contribute to increased likelihood of successful cross-pollination during low intensity flowering events and, in some cases, to enhanced probability of short-term seed and seedling survival. Both processes may contribute to the evolution of mast fruiting and general flowering in Southeast Asian lowland dipterocarp forests.

TI  - Evolution in age-structured populations
PY  - 1980
AB  - The populations of many species of animals and plants are age-structured, i.e. the individuals present at any one time were born over a range of different times, and their fertility and survival depend on age. The properties of such populations are important for interpreting experiments and observations on the genetics of populations for animal and plant breeding, and for understanding the evolution of features of life-histories such as senescence and time of reproduction. In this new edition Brian Charlesworth provides a comprehensive review of the basic mathematical theory of the demography and genetics of age-structured populations. The mathematical level of the book is such that it will be accessible to anyone with a knowledge of basic calculus and linear algebra.

TI  - No Trade‐Off between Seed Size and Number in the Valley Oak Quercus lobata
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract: We examined the relationship between acorn mass and number in valley oaks (Quercus lobata) over 4 years in central coastal California. Despite considerable variation in acorn size among both trees and years, trees produced acorns of the same size relative to other trees in different years. Across years, the relationship between acorn mass and acorn crop size was generally positive, even after controlling for environmental conditions and differences in individual tree size and quality. Life‐history trade‐offs in valley oaks are primarily between current and future reproduction and indirectly between concurrent growth and reproduction, not between seed size and number, and are probably related to this species’ mast‐seeding behavior. Phenotypic trade‐offs in long‐lived plants such as oaks exhibit complex patterns of life‐history covariation and deserve greater attention, both theoretically and empirically.

TI  - Null hypothesis testing: problems, prevalence, and an alternative
PY  - 2000
AB  - This paper presents a review and critique of statistical null hypothesis testing in ecological studies in general, and wildlife studies in particular, and describes an alternative. Our review of Ecology and the Journal of Wildlife Management found the use of null hypothesis testing to be pervasive. The estimated number of P-values appearing within articles of Ecology exceeded 8,000 in 1991 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1984, whereas the estimated number of P-values in the Journal of Wildlife Management exceeded 8,000 in 1997 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1994. We estimated that 47% (SE = 3.9%) of the P-values in the Journal of Wildlife Management lacked estimates of means or effect sizes or even the sign of the difference in means or other parameters. We find that null hypothesis testing is uninformative when no estimates of means or effect size and their precision are given. Contrary to common dogma, tests of statistical null hypotheses have relatively little utility in science and are not a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. We recommend their use be reduced in favor of more informative approaches. Towards this objective, we describe a relatively new paradigm of data analysis based on Kullback-Leibler information. This paradigm is an extension of likelihood theory and, when used correctly, avoids many of the fundamental limitations and common misuses of null hypothesis testing. Information-theoretic methods focus on providing a strength of evidence for an a priori set of alternative hypotheses, rather than a statistical test of a null hypothesis. This paradigm allows the following types of evidence for the alternative hypotheses: the rank of each hypothesis, expressed as a model; an estimate of the formal likelihood of each model, given the data; a measure of precision that incorporates model selection uncertainty; and simple methods to allow the use of the set of alternative models in making, formal inference. We provide an example of the information-theoretic approach using data on the effect of lead on survival in spectacled eider ducks (Somateria fischeri). Regardless of the analysis paradigm used, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be clearly separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging.

TI  - ON THE EVOLUTION OF ECOLOGICAL IDEAS: PARADIGMS AND SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS
PY  - 2002
AB  - We introduce a heuristic model for studying the evolution of ecological ideas based on Thomas Kuhn's concept of the development of scientific paradigms. This model is useful for examining processes leading to ecological progress and the elaboration of ecological theories. Over time, ecological knowledge diverges and evolves as data are collected that either refute or support the current trajectories of accepted paradigms. As a result, the direction of ecological research continuously branches out into new domains leading to increased ecological understanding. Unfortunately, heightened ecological un- derstanding also builds impediments to future progress. Increased specialization and the parallel evolution of seemingly independent subdisciplines generally compel researchers to become increasingly canalized. Specialization also accelerates the expansion of the ecological literature, making it difficult for researchers to track developments in their own subdisciplines, let alone the general field of ecology. Furthermore, specialization inherently focuses attention on contemporary research and hastens the erasure of memory of historical contributions to modern ecology. As a result, contemporary ecologists are in danger of losing touch with their historical roots and face a greater likelihood of recycling ideas and impeding real scientific momentum. Enhancing our historical perspective on the evolution of ecological ideas will be key in overcoming the negative consequences of progress and safeguarding the continued advancement of ecology.

TI  - Variation in seed traits of Lobelia inflata (Campanulaceae): sources and fitness consequences
PY  - 2000
AB  - Seed germination constitutes an important event in the life cycle of plants. Two related seed traits affect fitness: seed size and the timing of seed germination. In three sets of experiments, we (1) partition the sources of seed-size variance in Lobelia inflata into components attributable to fruit size, relative fruit position, and parental identity; (2) examine the influence of pregermination conditions and seed size on time to germination; and (3) assess the fitness consequences of seed size and germination timing under seminatural, harsh conditions. Seed-size variance is attributable to both parental identity and fruit position within an individual. Distal fruits produce larger but fewer seeds. No significant correlation exists between fruit size and seed size, but a trade-off is found between the number and size of seeds contained in a fruit after correcting for fruit size. The timing of germination is influenced by seed size, light conditions before winter, and winter duration. Germination timing influences survival, and despite small seed size in this species (2 × 10 g/seed), seed size has a persistent and significant association with both final plant size and the probability of survival to autumn.

TI  - Trophic Downgrading of Planet Earth
PY  - 2011
AB  - Until recently, large apex consumers were ubiquitous across the globe and had been for millions of years. The loss of these animals may be humankind's most pervasive influence on nature. Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.

TI  - Food webs: a ladder for picking strawberries or a practical tool for practical problems?
PY  - 2009
AB  - While food webs have provided a rich vein of research material over the last 50 years, they have largely been the subject matter of the pure ecologist working in natural habitats. While there are some notable exceptions to this trend, there are, as I explain in this paper, many applied questions that could be answered using a food web approach. The paper is divided into two halves. The first half provides a brief review of six areas where food webs have begun to be used as an applied tool: restoration ecology, alien species, biological control, conservation ecology, habitat management and global warming. The second half outlines five areas in which a food web approach could prove very rewarding: urban ecology, agroecology, habitat fragmentation, cross-habitat food webs and ecosystem services.

TI  - Invasive mammals and habitat modification interact to generate unforeseen outcomes for indigenous fauna.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Biotic invasions and habitat modification are two drivers of global change predicted to have detrimental impacts on the persistence of indigenous biota worldwide. Few studies have investigated how they operate synergistically to alter trophic interactions among indigenous and nonindigenous species in invaded ecosystems. We experimentally manipulated a suite of interacting invasive mammals, including top predators (cat Felis catus, ferret Mustela furo, stoat M. erminea), herbivores (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, hare Lepus europaeus), and an insectivore (hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis), and measured their effects on indigenous lizards and invertebrates and on an invasive mesopredator (house mouse Mus musculus). The work was carried out in a grassland/shrubland ecosystem that had been subjected to two types of habitat modification (widespread introduction of high-seed-producing pasture species, and areas of land use intensification by fertilization and livestock grazing). We also quantified food productivity for indigenous and invasive fauna by measuring pasture biomass, as well as seed and fruit production by grasses and shrubs. Indigenous fauna did not always increase following top-predator suppression: lizards increased on one of two sites; invertebrates did not increase on either site. Mesopredator release of mice was evident at the site where lizards did not increase, suggesting negative effects of mice on lizard populations. High mouse abundance occurred only on the predator-suppression site with regular production of pasture seed, indicating that this food resource was the main driver of mouse populations. Removal of herbivores increased pasture and seed production, which further enhanced ecological release of mice, particularly where pasture swards were overtopped by shrubs. An effect of landscape supplementation was also evident where nearby fertilized pastures boosted rabbit numbers and the associated top predators. Other studies have shown that both suppression of invasive predators and retiring land from grazing can benefit indigenous species, but our results suggest that the ensuing vegetation changes and complex interactions among invasive species can block recovery of indigenous fauna vulnerable to mesopredators. Top-down and bottom-up ecological release of mesopredators and landscape supplementation of top predators are key processes to consider when managing invaded communities in complex landscapes.

TI  - The Evolution of Food Caching by Birds and Mammals
PY  - 1984
AB  - We limit our discussion of food storage, or caching, to the movement of potential food items from one location to another for eating at some later time. This activity occurs exclusively in those animals that bring food to their offspring, and not in those that bring their offspring to food (i.e. that lay their eggs near food in a favorable microhabitat). Provisioning offspring is limited taxonomically to mammals, most birds, and some Hymenoptera. Moving food to a favorable microhabitat was apparently the first transitional step in the evolution of more complex systems of provisioning offspring in hymenopterans (72). Although all species that cache food provision their offspring, the converse is not true. Relatively few of the animals that provision their young with food also cache food, and caching food has no obvious connection to the glandular secretion of milk, which probably initiated offspring provisioning in the evolutionary history of mammals. Repeated traveling from a foraging area to dependent young seems to precondition animals for caching food. One of the goals of our review will be to determine what other conditions among species of birds and mammals and their food favor the evolution of caching. We limit our discussion to birds and nonhuman mammals because of our own backgrounds and because experimental studies have recently been done on these vertebrates (4, 14, 20, 48a, 62, 10la, 103-105, 116, 117, 128), although earlier investigations started with wasps (121). A corollary of provisioning offspring with food is a stable, relatively high metabolic rate (even in the Hymenoptera), which ensures that parents can maintain a steady flow of food to the relatively few, "expensive" offspring

TI  - One hundred years of population ecology: Successes, failures and the road ahead
PY  - 2015
AB  - Population ecology is the most mature of the three subdisciplines of ecology partly because it has a solid mathematical foundation and partly because it can address the primary questions of distribution and abundance with experimental protocols. Yet there is much left to do to integrate our population knowledge into community and ecosystem ecology to help address the global issues of food security and the conservation of biodiversity. Many different approaches are now being developed to bring about this integration and much more research will be necessary to decide which if any will be most useful in achieving our goals of explaining the changes we see in the distribution and abundance of animals and plants. Food web ecology would appear to be the best approach at present because it uses the detailed information of the population ecology of particular species in combination with data on consumer-resource interactions to apply to the applied problems of biodiversity conservation, food security, pest management and disease prevention. If we can use our understanding of population ecology to address the practical problems of our time in a creative way, we will benefit both the human population and the Earth's biodiversity. Much remains to be done.

TI  - The numerical and functional responses of a granivorous rodent and the fate of Neotropical tree seeds.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Despite their potential to provide mechanistic explanations of rates of seed dispersal and seed fate, the functional and numerical responses of seed predators have never been explicitly examined within this context. Therefore, we investigated the numerical response of a small-mammal seed predator, Heteromys desmarestianus, to disturbance-induced changes in food availability and evaluated the degree to which removal and fate of seeds of eight tree species in a lowland tropical forest in Belize were related to the functional response of H. desmarestianus to varying seed densities. Mark-recapture trapping was used to estimate abundance of H. desmarestianus in six 0.5-ha grids from July 2000 to September 2002. Fruit availability and seed fate were estimated in each grid, and two experiments nested within the grids were used to determine (1) the form of the functional response for nine levels of fruit density (2-32 fruits/m2), (2) the removal rate and handling times, and (3) the total proportion of fruits removed. The total proportion of fruits removed was determined primarily by the numerical response of H. desmarestianus to fruit availability, while removal rates and the proportion of seeds eaten or cached were related primarily to the form of the functional response. However, the numerical and functional responses interacted; H. desmarestianus showed strong spatial and temporal numerical responses to total fruit availability, and their density relative to fruit availability resulted in variation in the form of the functional response. Types I, II, and III functional responses were observed, as were density-independent responses, and these responses varied both among and within fruit species. The highest proportions of fruits were eaten when the Type III functional response was detected, which was when fruit availability was high relative to H. desmarestianus population density. Numerous idiosyncratic influences on seed fate have been documented, but our results indicate that shifts in the numerical and functional responses of seed predators to seasonal and interannual variation in seed availability potentially provide a general mechanistic explanation for patterns of removal and fate for vertebrate-dispersed seeds.

TI  - Trait‐mediated seed predation, dispersal and survival among frugivore‐dispersed plants in a fragmented subtropical forest, Southwest China
PY  - 2014
AB  - By tracking the fate of individual seeds from 6 frugivore-dispersed plants with contrasting seed traits in a fragmented subtropical forest in Southwest China, we explored how rodent seed predation and hoarding were influenced by seed traits such as seed size, seed coat hardness and seed profitability. Post-dispersal seed fates varied significantly among the 6 seed species and 3 patterns were witnessed: large-seeded species with a hard seed coat (i.e. Choerospoadias axillaries and Diospyros kaki var. silvestris) had more seeds removed, cached and then surviving at caches, and they also had fewer seeds predated but a higher proportion of seeds surviving at the source; medium-sized species with higher profitability and thinner seed coat (i.e. Phoebe zhennan and Padus braohypoda) were first harvested and had the lowest probability of seeds surviving either at the source or at caches due to higher predation before or after removal; and small-seeded species with lower profitability (i.e. Elaeocarpus japonicas and Cornus controversa) had the highest probability of seeds surviving at the source but the lowest probability of seeds surviving at caches due to lower predation at the source and lower hoarding at caches. Our study indicates that patterns of seed predation, dispersal and survival among frugivore-dispersed plants are highly determined by seed traits such as seed size, seed defense and seed profitability due to selective predation and hoarding by seed-eating rodents. Therefore, trait-mediated seed predation, dispersal and survival via seed-eating rodents can largely affect population and community dynamics of frugivore-dispersed plants in fragmented forests.

TI  - Value of long-term ecological studies
PY  - 2012
AB  - Long-term ecological studies are critical for providing key insights in ecology, environmental change, natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. In this paper, we briefly discuss five key values of such studies. These are: (1) quantifying ecological responses to drivers of ecosystem change; (2) understanding complex ecosystem processes that occur over prolonged periods; (3) providing core ecological data that may be used to develop theoretical ecological models and to parameterize and validate simulation models; (4) acting as platforms for collaborative studies, thus promoting multidisciplinary research; and (5) providing data and understanding at scales relevant to management, and hence critically supporting evidence-based policy, decision making and the management of ecosystems. We suggest that the ecological research community needs to put higher priority on communicating the benefits of long-term ecological studies to resource managers, policy makers and the general public. Long-term research will be especially important for tackling large-scale emerging problems confronting humanity such as resource management for a rapidly increasing human population, mass species extinction, and climate change detection, mitigation and adaptation. While some ecologically relevant, long-term data sets are now becoming more generally available, these are exceptions. This deficiency occurs because ecological studies can be difficult to maintain for long periods as they exceed the length of government administrations and funding cycles. We argue that the ecological research community will need to coordinate ongoing efforts in an open and collaborative way, to ensure that discoverable long-term ecological studies do not become a long-term deficiency. It is important to maintain publishing outlets for empirical field-based ecology, while simultaneously developing new systems of recognition that reward ecologists for the use and collaborative sharing of their long-term data sets. Funding schemes must be re-crafted to emphasize collaborative partnerships between field-based ecologists, theoreticians and modellers, and to provide financial support that is committed over commensurate time frames.

TI  - Seed predators exert selection on the subindividual variation of seed size
PY  - 2013
AB  - Subindividual variation among repeated organs in plants constitutes an overlooked level of variation in phenotypic selection studies, despite being a major component of phenotypic variation. Animals that interact with plants could be selective agents on subindividual variation. This study examines selective pressures exerted during post-dispersal seed predation and germination on the subindividual variation of seed size in hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). With a seed offering experiment and a germination test, we estimated phenotypic selection differentials for average and subindividual variation of seed size due to seed predation and germination. Seed size affects germination, growth rate and the probability of an individual seed of escaping predation. Longer seeds showed higher germination rates, but this did not result in significant selection on phenotypes of the maternal trees. On the other hand, seed predators avoided wider seeds, and by doing so exerted phenotypic selection on adult average and subindividual variation of seed size. The detected selection on subindividual variation suggests that the levels of phenotypic variation within individual plants may be, at least partly, the adaptive consequence of animal-mediated selection.

TI  - Inference and generality in ecology: current problems and an experimental solution
PY  - 1997
AB  - Two major points are considered: I) the growth of ecology is constrained and the scientific credibility of ecologists is reduced, because too many generalizations are accepted on insufficient evidence, and 2) there are experimental methods for addressing this problem. I illustrate problems that arise from theories that, although valid in limited domains, have been excessively generalized, and I examine methods for decreasing the disparity in populations considered between statistical inferences and scientific generalizations. The use of random factors in experimental designs helps to address the domain in which generalizations are valid, because the statistical population encompassed by random factors is much larger than that addressed typically by fixed factors. The use of random factors is considered in particular in mixed-model ANOVAs, because the basic techniques are well described and familiar to most ecologists. Mixed-model designs provide a strong experimental framework and address many of the problems with other methods for assessing the generality of ecological theories. No single experimental design will be sufficient to define the broader generalities that ecologists seek, but these designs should be included more often in research programs.

TI  - A continental scale trophic cascade from wolves through coyotes to foxes
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary 1. Top-down processes, via the direct and indirect effects of interspecific competitive killing (no consumption of the kill) or intraguild predation (consumption of the kill), can potentially influence the spatial distribution of terrestrial predators, but few studies have demonstrated the phenomenon at a continental scale. 2. For example, in North America, grey wolves Canis lupus are known to kill coyotes Canis latrans, and coyotes, in turn, may kill foxes Vulpes spp., but the spatial effects of these competitive interactions at large scales are unknown. 3. Here, we analyse fur return data across eight jurisdictions in North America to test whether the presence or absence of wolves has caused a continent-wide shift in coyote and red fox Vulpes vulpes density. 4. Our results support the existence of a continental scale cascade whereby coyotes outnumber red foxes in areas where wolves have been extirpated by humans, whereas red foxes outnumber coyotes in areas where wolves are present. However, for a distance of up to 200 km on the edge of wolf distribution, there is a transition zone where the effects of top-down control are weakened, possibly due to the rapid dispersal and reinvasion capabilities of coyotes into areas where wolves are sporadically distributed or at low densities. 5. Our results have implications for understanding how the restoration of wolf populations across North America could potentially affect co-occurring predators and prey. We conclude that large carnivores may need to occupy large continuous areas to facilitate among-carnivore cascades and that studies of small areas may not be indicative of the effects of top-down mesopredator control.

TI  - The tolerance–fecundity trade-off and the maintenance of diversity in seed size
PY  - 2010
AB  - Seed size commonly varies by five to six orders of magnitude among coexisting plant species, a pattern ecologists have long sought to explain. Because seed size trades off with seed number, small-seeded species clearly have the advantage in fecundity, but what is the countervailing advantage of large seeds? Higher competitive ability combined with strong competitive asymmetry can in theory allow coexistence through a competition–colonization trade-off, but empirical evidence is inconsistent with this mechanism. Instead, the key advantage of large seeds appears to be their tolerance of stresses such as shade or drought that are present in some but not all regeneration sites. Here I present a simple, analytically tractable model of species coexistence in heterogeneous habitats through a tolerance–fecundity trade-off. Under this mechanism, the more tolerant species win all of the more stressful regeneration sites and some of those that are less stressful, whereas the more fecund species win most but not all of the less stressful sites. The tolerance–fecundity trade-off enables stable coexistence of large numbers of species in models with and without seed limitation. The tolerance–fecundity mechanism provides an excellent explanation for the maintenance of diversity of seed size within plant communities and also suggests new hypotheses for coexistence in animal and microbial communities.

TI  - Lessons Learned From the History of Herbicide Resistance
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract The selection of herbicide-resistant weed populations began with the introduction of synthetic herbicides in the late 1940s. For the first 20 years after introduction, there were limited reported cases of herbicide-resistant weeds. This changed in 1968 with the discovery of triazine-resistant common groundsel. Over the next 15 yr, the cases of herbicide-resistant weeds increased, primarily to triazine herbicides. Although triazine resistance was widespread, the resistant biotypes were highly unfit and were easily controlled with specific alternative herbicides. Weed scientists presumed that this would be the case for future herbicide-resistant cases and thus there was not much concern, although the companies affected by triazine resistance were somewhat active in trying to detect and manage resistance. It was not until the late 1980s with the discovery of resistance to Acetyl Co-A carboxylase (ACCase) and acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors that herbicide resistance attracted much more attenti...

TI  - Comparative ecology of seed size and dispersal
PY  - 1996
AB  - Seed mass is correlated with a number of other plant traits, including dispersal mode, growth form and specific leaf area. Specific leaf area is the main determinant of potential relative growth rate and an indicator of the site quality to which a species is adapted. The relationships with dispersal mode and growth form have consistent form in five datasets from three continents, and each account for about 20-30% of variation in log seed mass. Thus, there is also very substantial variation within growth form and dispersal categories. Much, but not all, of the 20-30% is associated with shifted family composition between growth forms or dispersal modes. Experiments have shown that seedlings of larger-seeded species are better able to survive hazards including deep shade, drought, physical damage and the presence of competing vegetation. If there is a common mechanism under these different hazards, it seemingly must be a `reserve effect', whereby during deployment and early growth larger-seeded species hold a bigger percentage of seed reserves uncommitted to seedling structure and available to support respiration or repair damage. A reserve effect has not yet been demonstrated directly. It remains possible that different mechanisms operate under different hazards. Under a reserve effect, advantages of larger seed size should be temporary, and temporary advantage has indeed been observed with regard to seedling survival under dense shade. Although larger seed mass confers benefits on seedlings, larger seeds must necessarily be produced in smaller numbers per unit of resource allocated. Seed mass is presumed to have evolved as a compromise between these counterposed pressures. Yet there has proved to be surprisingly little difference in average seed mass between very different vegetation regions, at least in temperate climates. Rather, there is startlingly wide variation in seed mass among species growing interspersed with each other. Recent applications of game theory may be capable of accounting for this wide variation between coexisting species, but at present these models are driven by competition among seedling species (as opposed to between seedlings and adults). It remains unclear whether competition among seedlings is a decisive influence on species composition in most of the world's vegetation types.

TI  - Effective Ecological Monitoring
PY  - 2010
AB  - Long-term monitoring programs are fundamental to understanding the natural environment and effectively tackling major environmental problems. Yet they are often done very poorly and ineffectively. Effective Ecological Monitoring describes what makes successful and unsuccessful long-term monitoring programs.

Short and to the point, it illustrates key aspects with case studies and examples. It is based on the collective experience of running long-term research and monitoring programs of the two authors – experience which spans more than 70 years.

The book first outlines why long-term monitoring is important, then discusses why long-term monitoring programs often fail. The authors then highlight what makes good and effective monitoring. These good and bad aspects of long-term monitoring programs are further illustrated in the fourth chapter of the book. The final chapter sums up the future of long-term monitoring programs and how to make them better, more effective and better targeted.

TI  - Food webs: reconciling the structure and function of biodiversity
PY  - 2012
AB  - The global biodiversity crisis concerns not only unprecedented loss of species within communities, but also related consequences for ecosystem function. Community ecology focuses on patterns of species richness and community composition, whereas ecosystem ecology focuses on fluxes of energy and materials. Food webs provide a quantitative framework to combine these approaches and unify the study of biodiversity and ecosystem function. We summarise the progression of food-web ecology and the challenges in using the food-web approach. We identify five areas of research where these advances can continue, and be applied to global challenges. Finally, we describe what data are needed in the next generation of food-web studies to reconcile the structure and function of biodiversity.

It begins with a summary of the evolution, phylogeny, and biogeography of social and nonsocial rodents, providing a historical basis for comparative analyses. Subsequent sections focus on group-living rodents and characterize their reproductive behaviors, life histories and population ecology, genetics, neuroendocrine mechanisms, behavioral development, cognitive processes, communication mechanisms, cooperative and uncooperative behaviors, antipredator strategies, comparative socioecology, diseases, and conservation. Using the highly diverse and well-studied Rodentia as model systems to integrate a variety of research approaches and evolutionary theory into a unifying framework, "Rodent Societies" will appeal to a wide range of disciplines, both as a compendium of current research and as a stimulus for future collaborative and interdisciplinary investigations.

TI  - Multiplicity in Unity: Plant Subindividual Variation and Interactions with Animals
PY  - 2009
AB  - The implications of modularity for plants have been recognized for a long time. As Herrera points out in the first chapter, Theophrastus identified reiteration of modules in plants two thousand years ago, and agronomists and horticulturalists have grappled with the ‘problem’ of within-plant variation for decades because of practical reasons. The analysis and understanding of within-plant variation is a prime example of the substantial contribution that applied disciplines (e.g. horticulture, forestry) can make to disciplines that are more theory driven (e.g. plant ecology, evolutionary biology), a link that has huge latent potential to add value to science, but is seldom exploited. Herrera acknowledges at the start of Multiplicity in Unity that his approach is not theory driven, but descriptive instead and aimed at defining the problem as a foundation for further theoretical development, particularly in terms of understanding the evolutionary aspects of within-plant variation. The focus on plantanimal interactions is mainly because that is a field with which Herrera is most familiar, but the concept of within-plant variation could presumably be extended to any interactions between plants and other organisms that operate at the appropriate scale. In the first twothirds of the book, Herrera goes to great trouble to describe the problem and its mechanisms, using a wide diversity of examples, combined with his own extensive insights emerging from a career devoted to understanding the problem.The depth of treatment of the topic is ample. Multiplicity in Unity is one of those books that is a good example of how decades of work on a particular question by a visionary leader and co-workers can generate a rich contribution to a niche in science. Generally, most of the chapters include sections on variation in leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. Because my own interest is the interaction between trees and mammal herbivores, my attention soon turned to picking out the sections about leaves in the first half of the book, but my real interest was the last few chapters that focus specifically on plant-animal interactions and the evolutionary aspects of within-plant variation in traits. Herrera’s attention is mainly on insects, rather than mammals, which he explains as an outcome of mammals generally taking bites at scales larger than single organs. I would not agree entirely because several small and medium-size antelope do pick individual leaves or fruit from certain woody species, for example, duiker, steenbok, impala and goats, and I suspect that skirting the plant-mammal interaction is partly an artefact of the generally much greater attention paid to insect herbivores, particularly in Europe and North America, for obvious reasons.The relationship between scales of within-plant variation and scales of mammal herbivore foraging are still quite unclear and need to be further elucidated, if for no other reason than to define the relationship and refine sampling and data analysis methods. As such, Herrera does offer practical and comprehensive overviews of techniques that would be useful for anyone planning a study of within-plant variation. Throughout Multiplicity in Unity, the ubiquity of greater within-plant than among-plant variation is stressed (ad nauseum) and the value of variance as a useful trait in its own right in addition to trait means is emphasized. The message could probably have been delivered in a much shorter book.The text is loose and long winded in places and some concepts are hammered home repeatedly from one chapter to the next, which prompts one to soon start skipping paragraphs or pages if one reads the book from beginning to end. The upside is that one can just as well pick one or two chapters to read and get the gist. The reference list alone occupies a substantial fraction of the book (78 pp., 17%), but is a useful resource in itself. The chapter headings are exaggerated with long subtitles, presumably intended to highlight the key focus of each chapter, but I feel the ‘take-home’ message in each subtitle could have been reserved for a summary at the end of each chapter, yielding space on the

TI  - Does the seed size/number trade-off model determine plant community structure? An assessment of the model mechanisms and their generality
PY  - 2001
AB  - This paper examines four key mechanisms of the seed size/number trade-off (SSNT) models to assess their relevance to a general understanding of plant community structure. Mechanism 1 is that large seeds have a greater probability of winning in competition against smaller seeds. I provide interspecific experimental evidence that there is a competitive hierarchy among seedlings based on seed size. Mechanism 2 is that a trade-off exists between the number and size of seeds produced for a given reproductive allocation. Negative correlations between seed size and number were found consistently across a range of species from a range of habitats, from published literature. Mechanism 3, that seedling-seedling competition is an important influence on species composition, was found to exist potentially in a range of environments, including annual-dominated, post-fire and gap-dynamic communities. However, there is little quantitative evidence available and this is likely to be a restrictive mechanism. Mechanism 4, that small seeds are superior colonists due to their greater number, was tested in a field experiment in a calcareous grassland community. No supporting evidence was found, suggesting that the SSNT is not an important determinant of structure in this community. Thus two of the four mechanisms can be considered to hold true generally, while the third mechanism may be valid in particular environments. The fourth mechanism did not apply in the community tested, but could be tested in a wider range of communities.

TI  - Relationships between intra-specific variation in seed size and recruitment in four species in two contrasting habitats.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Large seeds contain more stored resources, and seedlings germinating from large seeds generally cope better with environmental stresses such as shading, competition and thick litter layers, than seedlings germinating from small seeds. A pattern with small-seeded species being associated with open habitats and large-seeded species being associated with closed (shaded) habitats has been suggested and supported by comparative studies. However, few studies have assessed the intra-specific relationship between seed size and recruitment, comparing plant communities differing in canopy cover. Here, seeds from four plant species commonly occurring in ecotones between open and closed habitats (Convallaria majalis, Frangula alnus, Prunus padus and Prunus spinosa) were weighed and sown individually (3200 seeds per species) in open and closed-canopy sites, and seedling emergence and survival recorded over 3 years. Our results show a generally positive, albeit weak, relationship between seed size and recruitment. In only one of the species, C. majalis, was there an association between closed canopy habitat and a positive seed size effect on recruitment. We conclude that there is a weak selection gradient favouring larger seeds, but that this selection gradient is not clearly related to habitat.

TI  - Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations
PY  - 2011
AB  - Unfortunately for mankind, it is very likely that the antibiotic resistance problem we have generated during the last 60 years due to the extensive use and misuse of antibiotics is here to stay for the foreseeable future. This view is based on theoretical arguments, mathematical modeling, experiments and clinical interventions, suggesting that even if we could reduce antibiotic use, resistant clones would remain persistent and only slowly (if at all) be outcompeted by their susceptible relatives. In this review, we discuss the multitude of mechanisms and processes that are involved in causing the persistence of chromosomal and plasmid-borne resistance determinants and how we might use them to our advantage to increase the likelihood of reversing the problem. Of particular interest is the recent demonstration that a very low antibiotic concentration can be enriching for resistant bacteria and the implication that antibiotic release into the environment could contribute to the selection for resistance.

TI  - Trophic cascades from wolves to grizzly bears in Yellowstone
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. We explored multiple linkages among grey wolves (Canis lupus), elk (Cervus elaphus), berry-producing shrubs and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Yellowstone National Park. 2. We hypothesized competition between elk and grizzly bears whereby, in the absence of wolves, increases in elk numbers would increase browsing on berry-producing shrubs and decrease fruit availability to grizzly bears. After wolves were reintroduced and with a reduced elk population, we hypothesized there would be an increase in the establishment of berry-producing shrubs, such as serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), which is a major berry-producing plant. We also hypothesized that the percentage fruit in the grizzly bear diet would be greater after than before wolf reintroduction. 3. We compared the frequency of fruit in grizzly bear scats to elk densities prior to wolf reintroduction during a time of increasing elk densities (1968–1987). For a period after wolf reintroduction, we calculated the percentage fruit in grizzly bear scat by month based on scats collected in 2007–2009 (n = 778 scats) and compared these results to scat data collected before wolf reintroduction. Additionally, we developed an age structure for serviceberry showing the origination year of stems in a northern range study area. 4. We found that over a 19-year period, the percentage frequency of fruit in the grizzly diet (6231 scats) was inversely correlated (P <0 001) with elk population size. The average percentage fruit in grizzly bear scats was higher after wolf reintroduction in July (03% vs. 59%) and August (78% vs. 146%) than before. All measured serviceberry stems accessible to ungulates originated since wolf reintroduction, while protected serviceberry growing in a nearby ungulate exclosure originated both before and after wolf reintroduction. Moreover, in recent years, browsing of serviceberry outside of the exclosure decreased while their heights increased. 5. Overall, these results are consistent with a trophic cascade involving increased predation by wolves and other large carnivores on elk, a reduced and redistributed elk population, decreased herbivory and increased production of plant-based foods that may aid threatened grizzly bears.

TI  - Effects of seed size of wind‐dispersed pines (Pinus) on secondary seed dispersal and the caching behavior of rodents
PY  - 2003
AB  - Seeds and nuts dispersed by scatter-hoarding animals are relatively large compared to propagules dispersed by other means. Possible selective forces in the evolution of large seed size include the selectivity of foraging animals and the ways that food-storing animals treat seeds and nuts after harvest. Treatment by rodents, primarily yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), of four species of pine seeds that vary in size was studied in the Carson Range of western Nevada. The pines, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta, 8.7 mg), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa, 55 mg), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi, 157 mg), and sugar pine (P. lambertiana, 213 mg), produce winged seeds that are initially wind-dispersed but are gathered by rodents and cached in the soil. Radioactive scandium-46 was used to follow the fates of seeds of all fours species placed around three source trees during autumn 1998 to 2000. Rodents gathered the seeds of all four species, but they took fewer of the lodgepole pine seeds and only six lodgepole seed caches (n=2106 total caches) were found during the three years. Among the other three species, number of seeds per cache decreased with increasing seed mass. However, the product of number of seeds per cache and seed mass was similar for all species. Sugar pine seeds were cached slightly deeper than ponderosa and Jeffrey pine seeds. For the species examined, seed size appeared to have had little effect on several other attributes, including mean dispersal distance, substrate choice, and microhabitat choice. Large size decreases wind dispersibility of pine seeds, but secondary dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents compensates for poor wind dispersal so that total dispersibility of large-seeded pines is not compromised.

TI  - Size-number trade-offs and the variation of seed size with plant resource status
PY  - 1992
AB  - I develop a general treatment of the effects of parental resource status on optimal offspring size. The model shows that even when there is a resource trade-off between size and number of offspring within individuals, positive correlations between size and number may occur among individuals due to individual variation in resources. Such positive correlations imply that parental resource status affects the fitness-maximizing offspring size, in contrast to the predictions of the standard Smith-Fretwell model. I show that parental resource status affects the fitness-maximizing offspring size whenever the size-number fitness function is nonhomogeneous in offspring number. This condition implies some sort of density-dependent interactions among offspring, although it is possible to have either positive or negative sib interactions in fitness functions that are homogeneous in offspring number. In the latter case offspring size should be insensitive to parental resource status. I explore several cases including ...

TI  - Improving plant functional groups for dynamic models of biodiversity: at the crossroads between functional and community ecology
PY  - 2012
AB  - The pace of on-going climate change calls for reliable plant biodiversity scenarios. Traditional dynamic vegetation models use plant functional types that are summarized to such an extent that they become meaningless for biodiversity scenarios. Hybrid dynamic vegetation models of intermediate complexity (hybrid-DVMs) have recently been developed to address this issue. These models, at the crossroads between phenomenological and process-based models, are able to involve an intermediate number of well-chosen plant functional groups (PFGs). The challenge is to build meaningful PFGs that are representative of plant biodiversity, and consistent with the parameters and processes of hybrid-DVMs. Here, we propose and test a framework based on few selected traits to define a limited number of PFGs, which are both representative of the diversity (functional and taxonomic) of the flora in the Ecrins National Park, and adapted to hybrid-DVMs. This new classification scheme, together with recent advances in vegetation modeling, constitutes a step forward for mechanistic biodiversity modeling.

TI  - Correlates of seed size variation: A comparison among five temperate floras
PY  - 1995
AB  - 1 Five temperate floras were studied to assess to what extent seed size correlations with other plant attributes are consistent across floras. The floras were from three continents: Australia (semiarid woodlands of western New South Wales, arid woodlands of Central Australia, and the Sydney region), North America (Indiana Dunes) and Europe (Sheffield region, UK). The plant attributes used were growth form, plant height, perenniality and dispersal mode. We used general linear models to consider not only the primary correlations between seed size and each other attribute, but also the overlap patterns among correlations to determine if each correlation could be interpreted as a secondary effect via a third variable. 2 Plant height and growth form were consistently correlated with the largest proportion of log seed mass variation (up to 37% in Central Australia). Although there was strong overlap in the amount of log seed mass variation explained by the two attributes (6-22%), each could explain small but significant variation after the other in all floras. The strong association between growth form/plant height and seed size was found not only among unassisted and wind-adapted species, but also among species dispersed by other means. 3 In all floras, dispersal mode was also able to account for significant variation in log seed mass independently of growth form and plant height. The association between plant perenniality and seed size could be explained as a secondary correlation of growth form and plant height with both seed size and perenniality. 4 There were significant differences in log seed mass among the five floras. However, seed size ranged over at least five orders of magnitude in each flora. Differences between floras could account for relatively little (4%) of the variation in seed size between species, compared to the attributes growth form (20%), plant height (20%) and dispersal mode (29%), despite the quite different soils and climates of the five floras. This suggests that seed size is more strongly associated with other plant attributes than with the environmental conditions for establishment. It appears that within any one community, plants have found a diversity of possible solutions to the problems of seedling establishment, resulting in a wide range of log seed mass.

TI  - Seedling survival and seed size: a synthesis of the literature
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary
1Large-seeded species have long been known to have higher survivorship during establishment than small-seeded species. Here, we assessed the size of this advantage by compiling published data on survival through seedling emergence, seedling establishment and sapling establishment.
2We found no relationship between seed mass and survival through the transition from viable seed in or on the soil to newly emerged seedlings (P = 0.47, n = 33 species).
3Synthesis of data from experimental studies on the advantages of large-seeded species establishing under particular hazards (such as shade, drought or herbivory) confirmed that seedlings of large-seeded species perform better than those of small-seeded species in most situations. However, the magnitude of this advantage was not sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m−2 of canopy outline year−1.
4Synthesis of data from field studies of populations under natural conditions also showed that large-seeded species have higher survival through early seedling establishment than small-seeded species (P = 0.006, n = 112 species). However, the magnitude of this advantage would only be sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m−2 of canopy outline year−1 if mortality continued at the same rate for some time.
5The time required for a species with 10-fold larger seeds to recoup the advantage gained by a smaller-seeded species during seed production ranged from 8.8 weeks for the smallest seeded species in the data set, up to an implausible 4.2 years for the largest-seeded species. Thus, while large-seeded species do have a survival advantage over small-seeded species during seedling establishment, the available evidence suggests that advantages must also accrue during other stages in the life cycle. One possibility is that the greater seed production of small-seeded species (m−2 of canopy outline year−1) is partly offset by larger canopies and longer reproductive life spans in large-seeded species.

TI  - Anticoagulant resistance in the United Kingdom and a new guideline for the management of resistant infestations of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus Berk.).
PY  - 2012
AB  - Anticoagulant resistance was first discovered in UK Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus Berk.) in 1958 and has been present ever since. The possible detrimental impact of resistance on effective rodent control was quickly recognised, and, for almost three decades, extensive research was conducted on the geographical distribution and severity of anticoagulant resistance in UK rats. Various schemes for the eradication of resistant rats were also implemented. At first, surveys showed resistance only to the first-generation anticoagulants, such as warfarin, chlorophacinone and coumatetralyl, but, later, resistance to the more potent second-generation anticoagulants, such as difenacoum and bromadiolone, was also discovered. Unlike some European countries, where only one or two resistance mutations occur, virtually all known rat resistance mutations occur in the United Kingdom, and five (Leu128Gln, Tyr139Ser, Tyr139Cys, Tyr139Phe and Leu120Gln) are known to have significant impacts on anticoagulant efficacy. Little is currently known of the geographical extent of anticoagulant resistance among Norway rats in the United Kingdom because no comprehensive survey has been conducted recently. At an operational level, anticoagulants generally retain their utility for Norway rat control, but it is impossible to control resistant rats in some areas because of restrictions on the use of the more potent resistance-breaking compounds. This paper reviews the development of resistance in Norway rats in the United Kingdom, outlines the present situation for resistance management and introduces a new resistance management guideline from the UK Rodenticide Resistance Action Group.

TI  - When is a ‘forest’ a savanna, and why does it matter?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Savannas are defined based on vegetation structure, the central concept being a discontinuous tree cover in a continuous grass understorey. However, at the high-rainfall end of the tropical savanna biome, where heavily wooded mesic savannas begin to structurally resemble forests, or where tropical forests are degraded such that they open out to structurally resemble savannas, vegetation structure alone may be inadequate to distinguish mesic savanna from forest. Additional knowledge of the functional differences between these ecosystems which contrast sharply in their evolutionary and ecological history is required. Specifically, we suggest that tropical mesic savannas are predominantly mixed tree–C4 grass systems defined by fire tolerance and shade intolerance of their species, while forests, from which C4 grasses are largely absent, have species that are mostly fire intolerant and shade tolerant. Using this framework, we identify a suite of morphological, physiological and life-history traits that are likely to differ between tropical mesic savanna and forest species. We suggest that these traits can be used to distinguish between these ecosystems and thereby aid their appropriate management and conservation. We also suggest that many areas in South Asia classified as tropical dry forests, but characterized by fire-resistant tree species in a C4 grass-dominated understorey, would be better classified as mesic savannas requiring fire and light to maintain the unique mix of species that characterize them.

TI  - Conflicting selection pressures on seed size: evolutionary ecology of fruit size in a bird-dispersed tree, Olea europaea.
PY  - 2003
AB  - Recent evidence indicates that fruit size has evolved according to dispersers’ size. This is hypothesized to result from a balance between factors favouring large seeds and dispersers setting the maximum fruit size. This hypothesis assumes that (1) the size of fruits that can be consumed by dispersers is limited, (2) fruit and seed size are positively correlated, and (3) the result of multiple selection pressures on seed size is positive. Our studies on the seed dispersal mutualism of Olea europaea have supported the first and second assumptions, but valid tests of the third assumption are still lacking. Here we confirm the third assumption. Using multiplicative fitness components, we show that conflicting selection pressures on seed size during and after dispersal reverse the negative pattern of selection exerted by dispersers.

TI  - Finding generality in ecology: a model for globally distributed experiments
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Advancing the field of ecology relies on understanding generalities and developing theories based on empirical and functional relationships that integrate across organ ismal to global spatial scales and span temporal scales. Significant advances in predicting responses of ecological communities to globally extensive anthropogenic perturbations, for example, require understanding the role of environmental context in determining outcomes, which in turn requires standardized experiments across sites and regions. Distributed collaborative experiments can lead to high-impact advances that would otherwise be unachievable. 2. Here, we provide specific advice and considerations relevant to researchers interested in employing this emerging approach using as a case study our experience developing and running the Nutrient Network, a globally distributed experimental network (currently >75 sites in 17 countries) that arose from a grassroots, cooperative research effort. 3. We clarify the design, goals and function of the Nutrient Network as a model to empower others in the scientific community to employ distributed experiments to advance our predictive understanding of global-scale ecological trends and responses. 4. Our experiences to date demonstrate that globally distributed experimental science need not be prohibitively expensive or time-consuming on aper capita basis and is not limited to senior scientists or countries where science is well funded. While distributed experiments are not a panacea for understanding ecological systems, they can substantially complement existing approaches.

TI  - Status and Solutions for the World’s Unassessed Fisheries
PY  - 2012
AB  - Recent reports suggest that many well-assessed fisheries in developed countries are moving toward sustainability. We examined whether the same conclusion holds for fisheries lacking formal assessment, which comprise >80% of global catch. We developed a method using species' life-history, catch, and fishery development data to estimate the status of thousands of unassessed fisheries worldwide. We found that small unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse condition than assessed fisheries, but that large unassessed fisheries may be performing nearly as well as their assessed counterparts. Both small and large stocks, however, continue to decline; 64% of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt. Our results suggest that global fishery recovery would simultaneously create increases in abundance (56%) and fishery yields (8 to 40%).

TI  - Evolutionary ecology of seed dormancy and seed size
PY  - 1996
AB  - The theoretical ideas underpinning the evolution of seed dormancy and seed mass are briefly reviewed. Comparative tests of these theoretical ideas are then presented; all tests use modern comparative methods to allow accurate, meaningful comparisons across species. The comparative analyses of seed dormancy demonstrate that species that average the environment across time, by having long-lived adults or space as a result of clonal growth, typically have less dormant seeds. Amongst species with seeds unspecialized for spatial dispersal, seed mass is not related to dormancy. However, in species with wind- or animal dispersed seeds those with heavy seeds typically have less dormancy. This is consistent with heavy seeds having better establishment success and /or suffering higher levels of herbivory. The relationships between seed mass and plant height, lateral spread and adult longevity are explored using the Sheffield dataset. The complex pattern of relationships between these variables is interpreted in terms of dispersal limitation, escape from competition with clonal ramets and differences in establishment conditions. Some of the problems that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of comparative data are briefly discussed.

AB  - To investigate the existence of coordinated sets of seedling traits adapted to contrasting establishment conditions, we examined evolutionary convergence in seedling traits for 299 French Guianan woody plant species and the stress response in a shadehouse of species representing seed size gradients within five major cotyledon morphology types. The French Guianan woody plant community has larger seeds than other tropical forest communities and the largest proportion of hypogeal cotyledon type (59.2%) reported for tropical forests. Yet the community includes many species with intermediate size seeds that produce seedlings with different cotyledonal morphologies. A split-plot factorial design with two light levels (0.8% and 16.1% PAR) and four damage treatments (control, seed damage, leaf damage, stem damage) was used in the shadehouse experiment. Although larger-seeded species had higher survival and slower growth, these patterns were better explained by cotyledon type than by seed mass. Even larger-seeded species with foliar cotyledons grew faster than species with reserve-type cotyledons, and survival after stem grazing was five times higher in seedlings with hypogeal cotyledons than with epigeal cotyledons. Thus, to predict seedling performance using seed size, seedling morphology must also be considered.

TI  - The theta-logistic is unreliable for modelling most census data
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary
1. The theta-logistic is a simple and flexible model for describing how the growth rate of a population slows as abundance increases. Starting at rm (taken as the maximum population growth rate), the growth response decreases in a convex or concave way (according to the shape parameter θ) to zero when the population reaches carrying capacity.

2. We demonstrate that fitting this model to census data is not robust and explain why. The parameters θ and rm are able to play-off against each other (providing a constant product), thus allowing both to adopt extreme and ecologically implausible values.

3. We use simulated data to examine: (i) a population fluctuating around a constant carrying capacity (K); (ii) recovery of a population from 10% of carrying capacity; and (iii) a population subject to variation in K. We show that estimates of extinction risk depending on this or similar models are therefore prone to imprecision. We refute the claim that concave growth responses are shown to dominate in nature.

4. As the model can also be sensitive to temporal variation in carrying capacity, we argue that the assumption of a constant carrying capacity is both problematic and presents a fruitful direction for the development of phenomenological density-feedback models.

TI  - The Optimal Balance between Size and Number of Offspring
PY  - 1974
AB  - The relationship between the energy expended per offspring, fitness of offspring, and parental fitness is presented in a two-dimensional graphical model. The validity of the model in determining an optimal parental strategy is demonstrated analytically. The model applies under various conditions of parental care and sibling care for the offspring but is most useful for species that produce numerous small offspring which are given no parental care.

TI  - Parallel ecological networks in ecosystems
PY  - 2009
AB  - In ecosystems, species interact with other species directly and through abiotic factors in multiple ways, often forming complex networks of various types of ecological interaction. Out of this suite of interactions, predator–prey interactions have received most attention. The resulting food webs, however, will always operate simultaneously with networks based on other types of ecological interaction, such as through the activities of ecosystem engineers or mutualistic interactions. Little is known about how to classify, organize and quantify these other ecological networks and their mutual interplay. The aim of this paper is to provide new and testable ideas on how to understand and model ecosystems in which many different types of ecological interaction operate simultaneously. We approach this problem by first identifying six main types of interaction that operate within ecosystems, of which food web interactions are one. Then, we propose that food webs are structured among two main axes of organization: a vertical (classic) axis representing trophic position and a new horizontal ‘ecological stoichiometry’ axis representing decreasing palatability of plant parts and detritus for herbivores and detrivores and slower turnover times. The usefulness of these new ideas is then explored with three very different ecosystems as test cases: temperate intertidal mudflats; temperate short grass prairie; and tropical savannah.

TI  - Paradigm shifts in marine fisheries genetics: ugly hypotheses slain by beautiful facts
PY  - 2008
AB  - By providing new approaches to the investigation of demographic and evolutionary dynamics of wild populations, molecular genetics has led to fundamental changes in our understanding of marine ecology. In particular, genetic approaches have revolutionized our understanding in three areas: (i) most importantly, they have contributed to the discovery of extensive genetic population structure in many marine species, overturning the notion of large, essentially homogenous marine populations limiting local adaptation and speciation. (ii) Concomitant differences in ecologically important traits now indicate extensive adaptive differentiation and biocomplexity, potentially increasing the resilience to exploitation and disturbance. Evidence for rapid adaptive change in many populations underlies recent concerns about fisheries-induced evolution affecting life-history traits. (iii) A compilation of recent published research shows estimated effective population sizes that are 2‐6 orders of magnitude smaller than census sizes, suggesting more complex recruitment dynamics in marine species than previously assumed. Studies on Atlantic cod are used to illustrate these paradigm shifts. In our synthesis, we emphasize the implications of these discoveries for marine ecology and evolution as well as the management and conservation of exploited marine fish populations. An important implication of genetic structuring and the potential for adaptive divergence is that locally adapted populations are unlikely to be replaced through immigration, with potentially detrimental consequences for the resilience to environmental change ‐ a key consideration for sustainable fisheries management.

TI  - On earthquake prediction in Japan.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Japan’s National Project for Earthquake Prediction has been conducted since 1965 without success. An earthquake prediction should be a short-term prediction based on observable physical phenomena or precursors. The main reason of no success is the failure to capture precursors. Most of the financial resources and manpower of the National Project have been devoted to strengthening the seismographs networks, which are not generally effective for detecting precursors since many of precursors are non-seismic. The precursor research has never been supported appropriately because the project has always been run by a group of seismologists who, in the present author’s view, are mainly interested in securing funds for seismology — on pretense of prediction. After the 1995 Kobe disaster, the project decided to give up short-term prediction and this decision has been further fortified by the 2011 M9 Tohoku Mega-quake. On top of the National Project, there are other government projects, not formally but vaguely related to earthquake prediction, that consume many orders of magnitude more funds. They are also un-interested in short-term prediction. Financially, they are giants and the National Project is a dwarf. Thus, in Japan now, there is practically no support for short-term prediction research. Recently, however, substantial progress has been made in real short-term prediction by scientists of diverse disciplines. Some promising signs are also arising even from cooperation with private sectors.

AB  - The theme of the book is the distribution and abundance of organisms in space and time. The core of the book lies in how local births and deaths are tied to emigration and immigration processes, and how environmental variability at different scales affects population dynamics with stochastic processes and spatial structure and shows how elementary analytical tools can be used to understand population fluctuations, synchrony, processes underlying range distributions and community structure and species coexistence. The book also shows how spatial population dynamics models can be used to understand life history evolution and aspects of evolutionary game theory. Although primarily based on analytical and numerical analyses of spatial population processes, data from several study systems are also dealt with. • Details the explicit spatial extension of the analyses of population and community processes • This book illustrates how theory and data analysis are close together and how data can be used to illustrate fundamental processes and vice versa • Through viewing population dynamics as a spatial process allows us to approach population ecology from the perspective of self-organised processes (Less)

TI  - Parental investment in offspring in variable environments:theoretical and empirical considerations.
PY  - 1987
AB  - It has been argued that environmental variability favors variation in offspring size. We have examined theoretically the effects of three types of environmental heterogeneity on parental investment: spatial variation, spatial variation with density-dependent offspring fitness, and temporal variability. We concluded that environmental heterogeneity rarely favors the production of variable offspring. With spatial heterogeneity and no density dependence in fitness, a single offspring size is always optimal. Variable offspring may be favored if density-dependent fitness loss to offspring is large and if parents can control the dispersal of offspring to the appropriate habitats. If environments vary temporally, the predicted optimal parental investment strategy depends on the measure of fitness used. If the arithmetic mean of fitness is used, a single offspring size is always favored. Variable offspring sizes are sometimes selected if fitness is measured by the arithmetic mean discounted for the variance or by...

TI  - Nonlinear effect of climate on plague during the third pandemic in China
PY  - 2011
AB  - Over the years, plague has caused a large number of deaths worldwide and subsequently changed history, not the least during the period of the Black Death. Of the three plague pandemics, the third is believed to have originated in China. Using the spatial and temporal human plague records in China from 1850 to 1964, we investigated the association of human plague intensity (plague cases per year) with proxy data on climate condition (specifically an index for dryness/wetness). Our modeling analysis demonstrates that the responses of plague intensity to dry/wet conditions were different in northern and southern China. In northern China, plague intensity generally increased when wetness increased, for both the current and the previous year, except for low intensity during extremely wet conditions in the current year (reflecting a dome-shaped response to current-year dryness/wetness). In southern China, plague intensity generally decreased when wetness increased, except for high intensity during extremely wet conditions of the current year. These opposite effects are likely related to the different climates and rodent communities in the two parts of China: In northern China (arid climate), rodents are expected to respond positively to high precipitation, whereas in southern China (humid climate), high precipitation is likely to have a negative effect. Our results suggest that associations between human plague intensity and precipitation are nonlinear: positive in dry conditions, but negative in wet conditions.

TI  - Seed size and plant strategy across the whole life cycle
PY  - 2006
AB  - We compiled information from the international literature to quantify the relationships between seed mass and survival through each of the hazards plants face between seed production and maturity. We found that small-seeded species were more abundant in the seed rain than large-seeded species. However, this numerical advantage was lost by seedling emergence. The disadvantage of small-seeded species probably results from size-selective post-dispersal seed predation, or the longer time small-seeded species spend in the soil before germination. Seedlings from large-seeded species have higher survival through a given amount of time as seedlings. However, this advantage seems to be countered by the greater time taken for large-seeded species to reach reproductive maturity: our data suggested no relationship, or perhaps a weak negative relationship, between seed size and survival from seedling emergence through to adulthood. A previous compilation showed that the inverse relationship between seed mass and the number of seeds produced per unit canopy area per year is countered by positive relationships between seed mass, plant size and plant longevity. Taken together, these data show that our old understanding of a species' seed mass as the result of a trade-off between producing a few large offspring, each with high survival probability, versus producing many small offspring each with a lower chance of successfully establishing was incomplete. It seems more likely that seed size evolves as part of a spectrum of life history traits, including plant size, plant longevity, juvenile survival rate and time to reproduction.

TI  - A comparative study of seed number, seed size, seedling size and recruitment in grassland plants
PY  - 2000
AB  - In this study we analyse relationships between seed number, seed size, seedling size and recruitment success in grassland plants. The often hypothesised trade-off between seed size and seed number was supported by a cross-species analysis and by an analysis of 35 phylogenetically independent contrasts, derived from a data-set of 72 species. Apart from among-species relatedness, we also controlled for possible confounding effect of plant size that may influence both seed size and seed number. A sowing experiment with 50 species was performed in the field. The seeds were sown in a grassland and subjected to two treatments, disturbance and undisturbed sward. Evidence for seed-limited recruitment was obtained for 45 of the species. Disturbance had a significant, or nearly significant, positive effect on recruitment for 16 of the 45 species. The relative recruitment in undisturbed sward increased with increased seed size, and both recruitment success and seedling size were positively related to seed size. We suggest that a trade-off between competitive ability and number of recruitment opportunities follows from the trade-off between seed size and seed number, through a causal chain from seed size via seedling size to recruitment success. The relationships between seed size, seed number and recruitment may be an important underlying mechanism for abundance and dynamics of plant species in grassland vegetation. This is an example of a direct link between evolutionary life-history theory, and theory of plant community structure.

TI  - Predicting Plant Diversity Response to Disturbance: Applicability of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis and Mass Ratio Hypothesis
PY  - 2013
AB  - Predicting the relationships between disturbance, biodiversity and productivity of ecosystems continue to preoccupy ecologists and resource managers. Two hypotheses underpin many of the discussions. The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), which proposes that biodiversity peaks at intermediate levels of disturbance, is often extended to predict that productivity follows the same response pattern. The Mass Ratio Hypothesis (MRH) proposes that the biological traits of the dominant species are the critical drivers of ecosystem function (e.g., productivity) and that these species increase in biomass rapidly after disturbance then stabilize. As a consequence, species diversity first peaks then declines after disturbance as a few species dominate the site. Both provide a conceptual link among disturbance, species diversity and productivity (an index of ecosystem function). We assessed the current state of empirical support for these two hypotheses with a literature survey and determined if their conforman...

TI  - SEED SIZE AND SEED PACKAGING VARIATION IN BAPTISIA LANCEOLATA (FABACEAE)
PY  - 1993
AB  - Pods and seeds of field-collected Baptisia lanceolata plants were analyzed to partition seed weight and seed packaging trait variance among and within plants and to detect relationships between these traits. Packaging traits studied were: pod weight, seed weight per pod, number of seeds per pod, mean weight of seeds per pod, proportion seed weight of total pod weight, and pod weight per seed. Significant among-plant variation was found for seed weight and all packaging traits. Within plants, positive correlations were found between number of seeds per pod and pod dry weight and between the proportion seed weight of total pod weight and number of seeds per pod. Pod weight per seed was negatively correlated with number of seeds per pod. Most plants had a negative correlation between mean seed weight and number of seeds per pod. When compared with an equality of slopes test, slopes of regressions of the above pairs of traits were found to differ among plants. Among plants, the same relationships were found, except for the latter two traits, which were not correlated. These within-plant patterns may represent constraints on seed weight variance imposed by the seed package. This view is supported by a positive correlation between packaging trait variance and seed weight variance. Packaging-related constraints could have an effect on seed weight in this and other species. If these phenotypic constraints have a genetic basis, then selection on seed packaging could change seed weight in a way different from that which might be predicted by considering seed weight alone.

TI  - Density Estimation by Spatially Explicit Capture–Recapture: Likelihood-Based Methods
PY  - 2009
AB  - Population density is a key ecological variable, and it has recently been shown how captures on an array of traps over several closely-spaced time intervals may be modelled to provide estimates of population density (Borchers and Efford 2007). Specifics of the model depend on the properties of the traps (more generally ‘detectors’). We provide a concise description of the newly developed likelihood-based methods and extend them to include ‘proximity detectors’ that do not restrict the movements of animals after detection. This class of detector includes passive DNA sampling and camera traps. The probability model for spatial detection histories comprises a submodel for the distribution of home-range centres (e.g. 2-D Poisson) and a detection submodel (e.g. halfnormal function of distance between a range centre and a trap). The model may be fitted by maximising either the full likelihood or the likelihood conditional on the number of animals observed. A wide variety of other effects on detection probability may be included in the likelihood using covariates or mixture models, and differences in density between sites or between times may also be modelled. We apply the method to data on stoats Mustela erminea in a New Zealand beech forest identified by microsatellite DNA from hair samples. The method assumes that multiple individuals may be recorded at a detector on one occasion. Formal extension to ‘single-catch’ traps is difficult, but in our simulations the ‘multi-catch’ model yielded nearly unbiased estimates of density for moderate levels of trap saturation (≤ 86% traps occupied), even when animals were clustered or the traps spanned a gradient in density.

TI  - Alternatives to statistical hypothesis testing in ecology: a guide to self teaching.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Statistical methods emphasizing formal hypothesis testing have dominated the analyses used by ecologists to gain insight from data. Here, we review alternatives to hypothesis testing including techniques for parameter estimation and model selection using likelihood and Bayesian techniques. These methods emphasize evaluation of weight of evidence for multiple hypotheses, multimodel inference, and use of prior information in analysis. We provide a tutorial for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and model selection using information theoretics, including a brief treatment of procedures for model comparison, model averaging, and use of data from multiple sources. We discuss the advantages of likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analysis as ways to accumulate understanding across multiple studies. These statistical methods hold promise for new insight in ecology by encouraging thoughtful model building as part of inquiry, providing a unified framework for the empirical analysis of theoretical models, and by facilitating the formal accumulation of evidence bearing on fundamental questions.

PY  - 1994
AB  - Conservation biology has two threads: the small-population paradigm which deals with the erect of smallness on the persistence of a population, and the declining-population paradigm which deals with the cause of smallness and its cure. The processes relevant to the small-population paradigm are amenable to theoretical examination because they generalize across species and are subsumed by an inclusive higher category: stochasticity. In contrast, the processes relevant to the declining-population paradigm are essentially humdrum, being not one but many. So far they have defied tight generalization and hence are of scant theoretical interest. The small-population paradigm has not yet contributed significantly to conserving endangered species in the wild because it treats an erect (smallness) as if it were a cause

TI  - Rules of the seed size game : contests between large-seeded and small-seeded species
PY  - 2012
AB  - A trade-off between seed size and seed number is central in seed ecology, and has been suggested to be related to a trade-off between competition and colonization, as well as to a trade-off between stress tolerance and fecundity. Large seeds endure hazards during establishment, such as shading, drought, litter coverage and competition from other plants, better than do small seeds, due to a larger amount of stored resources in the seed. Small seeds, however, are numerous and small-seeded species are therefore more fecund. Moreover, a pattern with small-seeded species being associated with open habitats and large-seeded species being associated with closed habitats has been reported in the literature. In this thesis I assess effects of seed size on recruitment, and how relationships between seed size and recruitment may relate to habitat conditions. Seed sowing experiments were performed in the field to assess inter- and intra-specific relationships between seed size and recruitment in open and closed habitats (Paper I and II). Seed removal experiments were performed in the field to assess what effects seed predation may have on a relationship between seed size and recruitment (Paper III). A garden experiment was performed based on contests between larger-seeded and smaller-seeded species, in order to examine different models on co-existence of multiple seed size strategies. The results showed that there was a weak positive relationship between seed size and recruitment in the field, and that this relationship was only weakly and inconclusively related to habitat (Paper I and II). Seed removal was negatively related to seed size in closed habitats and unrelated to seed size in open habitats (Paper III). This indicates that any positive relationship between seed size and recruitment may be an effect of higher seed removal in small-seeded species. However, when grown under controlled conditions in a garden experiment, there was a clear advantage of larger-seeded species over smaller-seeded species (Paper IV). This advantage was unaffected by seed density, indicating that there was no competitive advantage of the larger-seeded species. Instead, indirect evidence suggests that larger-seeded species exhibit higher tolerance to stress.

When compared with an equality of slopes test, slopes of regressions of the above pairs of traits were found to differ among plants. Among plants, the same relationships were found, except for the latter two traits, which were not correlated. These within-plant patterns may represent constraints on seed weight variance imposed by the seed package. This view is supported by a positive correlation between packaging trait variance and seed weight variance. Packaging-related constraints could have an effect on seed weight in this and other species. If these phenotypic constraints have a genetic basis, then selection on seed packaging could change seed weight in a way different from that which might be predicted by considering seed weight alone.

TI  - An Introduction to Bayesian Inference for Ecological Research and Environmental Decision‐Making
PY  - 1996
AB  - In our statistical practice, we ecologists work comfortably within the hypothetico-deductive epistemology of Popper and the frequentist statistical methodology of Fisher. Consequently, our null hypotheses do not often take into account pre-existing data and do not require parameterization, our experiments demand large sample sizes, and we rarely use results from one experiment to predict the outcomes of future experiments. Comparative statistical statements such as we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level, which reflect the likelihood of our data given our hypothesis, are of little use in communicating our results to nonspecialists or in describing the degree of certitude we have in our conclusions. In contrast, Bayesian statistical inference requires the explicit assignment of prior probabilities, based on existing information, to the outcomes of experiments. Such an assignment forces the parameterization of null and alternative hypotheses. The results of these experiments, regardless of sample size, then can be used to compute posterior probabilities of our hypotheses given the available data. Inferential conclusions in a Bayesian mode also are more meaningful in environmental policy discussions: e.g., our experiments indicate that there is a 95% probability that acid deposition will affect northeastern conifer forests. Based on comparisons with current statistical practice in ecology, I argue that a Bayesian ecology would (a) make better use of pre-existing data; (b) allow stronger conclusions to be drawn from large-scale experiments with few replicates; and (c) be more relevant to environmental decision-making.

TI  - Are dingoes a trophic regulator in arid Australia? A comparison of mammal communities on either side of the dingo fence
PY  - 2010
AB  - The direct and indirect interactions that large mammalian carnivores have with other species can have far-reaching effects on ecosystems. In recent years there has been growing interest in the role that Australia's largest terrestrial predator, the dingo, may have in structuring ecosystems. In this study we investigate the effect of dingo exclusion on mammal communities, by comparing mammal assemblages where dingoes were present and absent. The study was replicated at three locations spanning 300 km in the Strzelecki Desert. We hypothesized that larger species of mammal subject to direct interactions with dingoes should increase in abundance in the absence of dingoes while smaller species subject to predation by mesopredators should decrease in abundance because of increased mesopredator impact. There were stark differences in mammal assemblages on either side of the dingo fence and the effect of dingoes appeared to scale with body size. Kangaroos and red foxes were more abundant in the absence of dingoes while Rabbits and the Dusky Hopping-mouse Notomys fuscus were less abundant where dingoes were absent, suggesting that they may benefit from lower red fox numbers in the presence of dingoes. Feral cats and dunnarts (Sminthopsis spp.) did not respond to dingo exclusion. Our study provides evidence that dingoes do structure mammal communities in arid Australia; however, dingo exclusion is also associated with a suite of land use factors, including sheep grazing and kangaroo harvesting that may also be expected to influence kangaroo and red fox populations. Maintaining or restoring populations of dingoes may be useful strategies to mitigate the impacts of mesopredators and overgrazing by herbivores.

TI  - Why Most Published Research Findings Are False
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research fi ndings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientifi c fi eld. In this framework, a research fi nding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a fi eld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater fl exibility in designs, defi nitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater fi nancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientifi c fi eld in chase of statistical signifi cance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientifi c fi elds, claimed research fi ndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research. It can be proven that most claimed research fi ndings are false.

TI  - THE EVOLUTION OF QUANTITATIVE MARINE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT 1985–2010
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract This paper reviews the changes in quantitative marine fisheries management between 1985 and 2010. The two primary areas where quantitative methods have been employed are in the assessment of stock size and exploitation rates, and in the design and evaluation of harvest strategies. In 1985, some areas had well established assessment programs in place, and the assessment methods have been relatively stable over the 25 years in question. In other places, the evolution of methods has been much more dramatic, and where there were either no assessments performed or early virtual population analysis (VPA) was done using mainly catch-at-age data, complex statistical models using maximum likelihood or Bayesian statistics are now common. Harvest strategies have generally evolved even more. In 1985, most harvest strategies were based on fixed exploitation rates from yield-per-recruit analyses. By 2010, most agencies had adopted harvest strategies that specifically reduced exploitation rates as abundance dropped below the biomass that will produce maximum sustainable yield. Simulation testing of these harvest strategies has become an integral part of their design, often using the uncertainty from the assessments to bound the robustness trials for the harvest strategy. Two major areas of new quantitative methods are (i) spatially explicit models that can be used for marine spatial planning, and (ii) in ecosystem models to evaluate ecosystem wide impacts of fishing.

TI  - Constraints and Competition in the Evolution of Flowering Phenology
PY  - 1986
AB  - We tested whether the flowering times of animal-pollinated plants are influenced by phylogenetic membership and by life form (e.g., annual, perennial, etc.). We analyzed existing data sets on 2298 animal-pollinated angiosperms of North and South Carolina and 1575 animal-pollinated angiosperms of temperate Japan, and also analyzed a null model based upon the Carolina flora. Our analyses of the complete data sets and of subsets including only the largest families showed that: (1) the floras of the Carolinas and temperate Japan have bimodal distributions of flowering times, with peaks in spring and late summer; (2) within each of these floras, families differ very significantly in flowering time; (3) for most families, flowering times in the Carolinas and in Japan are statistically indistinguishable; (4) the sequences of flowering, ordered by family, are also statistically indistinguish- able in the two floras; (5) within each flora, skewness of flowering time differs markedly among families; (6) for a typical family, the skewness of flowering time is the same in the two floras; (7) there is a significant negative correlation between skewness and mean family flowering time; and (8) life forms differ in flowering time, though less markedly than families. These results demonstrate that phylogenetic membership and life form strongly influence a species' flowering time. We argue that seasonal limi- tations of flowering times are caused by phylogenetic constraints, which may not have changed for millions of years. This study does not provide the degree of resolution needed to determine whether or not there is natural selection for alteration of flowering times in these floras, whether by competition or other mechanisms. However, our results do suggest that competition for pollination does not push species' flowering times beyond seasonal boundaries imposed by phylogenetic constraints. The effects of competition on flowering time are probably limited to small and temporary readjustments of the phenological relationships of competitors. Studies of the flowering times of animal-pollinated plants must consider the strong limits to seasonal displacement imposed by phylogeny and life form, and the probable existence of many alternative modes of escape from competition besides seasonal shifts. We consider the implications of recent paleobotanical studies that suggest that temperate plant com- munities may not have been sufficiently stable through time for plants to have achieved competitive equilibria. Phylogenetic and life history constraints are likely to influence the evolution of many community characters besides flowering time. The methods we have used and the conclusions we have drawn are relevant to a wide variety of ecological characters in plants and animals.

TI  - A new classification for plant phenology based on flowering patterns in lowland tropical rain forest trees at La Selva, Costa Rica
PY  - 1994
AB  - A new classification and conceptual framework for plant phenology are proposed to resolve problems in describing tropical patterns. A long-term (12 yr) survey of flowering in 254 lowland tropical rain forest trees of 173 species from the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica showed highly diverse, irregular, and complex patterns. Analysis of this survey data relied primarily on graphical analyses that provide data representation methods rather than numerical summaries that provide data reduction methods. The classification differs from previous ones in three ways. It uses, as the primary criterion, frequency of the time series, based on explicit time and amplitude scales, so that irregular temporal sequences are revealed. It features a system of subsidiary classes based on other quantitative descriptors: regularity, duration, amplitude, date, and synchrony. Finally, the conceptual framework separates patterns at each level of analysis so that adding the time series at one level produces a time series for the next higher level. Levels are hierarchical from the flower to the individual, population, and community with additional non-nested levels such as the guild. The four basic classes-continual, subannual, annual, and supra-annual--are applied to patterns at any level of analysis. The classification system provides a logical framework for quantitative description of phenological behavior leading to more standardized comparisons. Thus we can see that tropical phenology differs from temperate phenology in two major ways. In tropical species, the nature of the pattern may change from one level of analysis to the next, which is not typical of temperate species. In many tropical species, phenological patterns vary more widely over the geographic range of a species than they do in temperate species.

TI  - The Breeding Structure of Tropical Tree Populations
PY  - 1990
AB  - Abstract Several approaches were used to study the breeding structure of tropical tree populations located on Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama. Allozyme analyses of 16 woody species indicated that the distribution of genetic diversity among collection sites was closely associated with the species’breeding system and seed dispersal mechanism. Low levels of diversity observed among collection sites separated by 1–2 km indicate that intersite gene flow is high. Estimates of the proportion of outcrossing obtained for seven species indicated that the majority (6) were highly outcrossed. A significant amount of tree to tree heterogeneity in pollen allele frequencies also existed for each outcrossing species. Degree of heterogencity in pollen allele frequencies received by maternal trees was negatively associated with flowering tree density. In the mixed mating species, Cavanillesia plantanifolia, the proportion of selfing was closely related to flowering tree density. A significant proportion of the pollen received by individuals of these eight species came from relative few individuals. Pollen movement within populations was estimated for two canopy species. Long distance pollen movement (>750m) was extensive (>20%) in both species. The breeding structure of these tropical species appears to be a mixture of near-neighbor (30%–50%) and long-distance pollen movement (10%–25%). If this pattern is typical of tropical tree species, it has important implications for the genetic structure of populations as well as for the design of conservation areas.

TI  - Phylogeny of the tropical tree family Dipterocarpaceae based on nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast RBCL gene.
PY  - 1999
AB  - The Dipterocarpaceae, well-known trees of the Asian rain forests, have been variously assigned to Malvales and Theales. The family, if the Monotoideae of Africa (30 species) and South America and the Pakaraimoideae of South America (one species) are included, comprises over 500 species. Despite the high diversity and ecological dominance of the Dipterocarpaceae, phylogenetic relationships within the family as well as between dipterocarps and other angiosperm families remain poorly defined. We conducted parsimony analyses on rbcL sequences from 35 species to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Dipterocarpaceae. The consensus tree resulting from these analyses shows that the members of Dipterocarpaceae, including Monotes and Pakaraimaea, form a monophyletic group closely related to the family Sarcolaenaceae and are allied to Malvales. The present generic and higher taxon circumscriptions of Dipterocarpaceae are mostly in agreement with this molecular phylogeny with the exception of the genus Hopea, which forms a clade with Shorea sections Anthoshorea and Doona. Phylogenetic placement of Dipterocarpus and Dryobalanops remains unresolved. Further studies involving representative taxa from Cistaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Hopea, Shorea, Dipterocarpus, and Dryobalanops will be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the phylogeny and generic limits of the Dipterocarpaceae.

               <jats:p>In Tropical Forest Ecology, Egbert G. Leigh, Jr., one of the world’s foremost tropical ecologists, introduces the reader to the tropical forest, and describes the intricate web of interdependence among the great diversity of tropical plants and animals. Focusing on the tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, Leigh shows what Barro Colorado can tell us about other tropical forests--and what tropical forests can tell us about Barro Colorado. This book considers three essential questions for understanding the ecological organization of tropical forests. How do they stay green with their abundance of herbivores? Why do they have such a diversity of plants and animals? And what role does mutualism play in the ecology of tropical forests? Beautifully written and abundantly illustrated, Tropical Forest Ecology, will certainly appeal to a wide variety of scientists in the fields of evolution, tropical biology, botany, zoology, and natural history.</jats:p>

TI  - Interspecific flowering patterns in the Dipterocarpaceae in West Malaysia: implications for predator satiation.
PY  - 1991
AB  - Nanophyes shoreae is a pre-dispersal fruit-predator of several species of Dipterocarpaceae. The timing of oviposition of this weevil was monitored in six trees in Pasoh Forest Reserve, West Malaysia from September 1986 to February 1987. A flowering event occurred during this period. Oviposition started within 12 days after peak anthesis, and continued within any one tree for 11–39 days. Host trees of N. shoreae flowered over a 75 day period. Intra-specific flowering synchrony was high but different species flowered sequentially. The behaviour of N. shoreae and the period of the oviposition ‘window’ strongly suggest that this pre-dispersal fruit-predator ‘tracks’ the sequence of flowering shown by its host species. The implications for predator satiation through mass-flowering of the Dipterocarpaceae are discussed.

TI  - ON THE ADAPTIVE VALUE OF REPRODUCTIVE SYNCHRONY AS A PREDATOR-SWAMPING STRATEGY
PY  - 1990
AB  - The logic behind the hypothesis explaining reproductive synchrony as a strategy for reducing the predation of vulnerable offspring (predator swamping) is evaluated by means of two simple models. Predator swamping was found to be an adequate explanation for the occurrence of within-season reproductive synchrony when the predator exhibits a Holling type-II functional response (specialist predator). However, in the case of a generalist predator switching from alternative prey (Holling type-III functional response), which is expected to be a common functional-response type when particular prey are unavailable at certain times of the year, highly asynchronous reproduction may be the best reproductive strategy. In particular, when prey switching occurs at high offspring densities and/or the satiation density of the predator is high relative to the total reproduction of the prey population, the peak predation rate is expected to occur when reproduction is completely synchronous. Spatially clumped prey population...

PY  - 1980
AB  - SummaryApis dorsata has a regular annual cycle of migration in Sri Lanka. In February the colonies are spread throughout the coastal plains and the North Central Region. In June and July they migrate to the Up Country, which they leave again in October-November. The swarms seem to migrate in several stages, remaining for some days at a resting place between flights. These have different characteristics from the nest sites.Before the swarm flew off, migration dances indicated the direction of its departure. These dances occurred all over the cluster, unlike food dances which occurred only on the area where the light intensity was greatest. If the bees could not see the sun or sky, dance and flight activities were very low, but migration dances indicated a constant direction. With an indirect view of the sky through a mirror, activity was greater than with none, but the direction of migration dances was not changed. Swarms left in the direction indicated by migration dances.Queenless portions of swarms were...

TI  - The Reproductive Ecology of an Emergent Dipterocarp in a Lowland Rain Forest in Sarawak
PY  - 1996
AB  - This paper reports the first direct observation of reproductive processes of an emergent tree, Dryobalanops lanceolata (Dipterocarpaceae), and its interactions with pollinators and seed predators, using a canopy observation system built in Sarawak, Malaysia. D. lanceolata flowers were mostly pollinated by medium-sized stingless bees (Trigona spp., Apidae), and stigmas of all unbagged flowers received pollen grains. Ovaries did not develop without pollination. Abortion rate in the early stage of fruit development was 93% in fruits fertilized by natural pollinators. All the experimentally selfed ovaries were aborted at this stage. Despite the heavy abortion rate, the dry weight loss at this stage was only 17% of the total reproductive effort, because abortion occurred before active investment in fruits. Among the remaining fruits, 40% were lost to the primary seed predator, Mecysolobus crassus (Curculionidae). Such attacked fruits were also selectively aborted at the middle stage of fruit maturation. Final germinating fruits, which were 3.6% of the total number of flowers, got 47% of the total reproductive effort.

TI  - FIELD METABOLIC RATE AND FOOD REQUIREMENT SCALING IN MAMMALS AND BIRDS
PY  - 1987
AB  - Field metabolic rates (FMRs or HF), all measured using doubly labeled water, of 23 species of eutherian mammals, 13 species of marsupial mammals, and 25 species of birds were summarized and analyzed allometrically (log10-1og10 regressions). FMR is strong- ly correlated with body mass in each of these groups. FMR scales differently than does basal or standard metabolic rate in eutherians (FMR slope = 0.81) and marsupials (FMR slope = 0.58), but not in birds (FMR slope = 0.64 overall, but 0.75 in passerines and 0.75 in all other birds). Medium-sized (240-5 50 g) eutherians, marsupials, and birds have similar FMRs, and these are - 17 times as high as FMRs of like-sized ectothermic vertebrates such as iguanid lizards. For endothermic vertebrates, the energy cost of surviving in nature is enormous compared with that for ectotherms. Within the eutherians, marsupials, or birds, FMR scales differently for the following subgroups: rodents, passerine birds, her- bivorous eutherians, herbivorous marsupials, desert eutherians, desert birds, and seabirds. Equations are given for use in predicting daily and annual FMR and food requirement of a species of terrestrial vertebrate, given its body mass.

AB  - Species comprising two monophyletic groups of Alcidodes sensu lato (crassus group and dipterocarpi group) feed on fruits of the ecologically and economically important tropical timber family Dipterocarpaceae. Fifteen Alcidodes species are newly described from several thousand specimens of seed-feeding beetles reared from south-east Asian dipterocarp hosts (Dipterocarpoidae) and four other species are revised. Morphological keys are provided for identifying these 19 taxa. Weevil associations are provided for 70 species of Dipterocarpaceae in five genera (16 Dipterocarpus spp., four Dryobalanops spp., six Hopea spp., 39 Shorea spp. and five Vatica spp.). These records relate primarily to specimens reared from seeds in Borneo and in Peninsular Malaysia, but all known previous host records are also included (from India, Andaman Islands, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines) and assessed. These validated and documented host associations refute general assertions that (1) seed-eating beetles are host-spe...

TI  - Plant reproductive phenology over four years including an episode of general flowering in a lowland dipterocarp forest, Sarawak, Malaysia
PY  - 1999
AB  - The first systematic observation of a general flowering, a phenomenon unique to lowland mixed-dipterocarp forests in Southeast Asia, is presented. During general flowering, which occurs at irregular intervals of 3‐10 yr, nearly all dipterocarp species together with species of other families come heavily into flower. We monitored reproductive phenology of 576 individual plants representing 305 species in 56 families in Sarawak, Malaysia. Observations continued for 53 mo from August 1992 and covered one episode of a general flowering cycle. Among 527 effective reproductive events during 43 mo, 57% were concentrated in the general flowering period (GFP) of 10 mo in 1996. We classified 257 species into flowering types based on timing and frequency of flowering. The most abundant type was ‘‘general flowering’’ (35%), which flowered only during GFP. The others were ‘‘supra-annual’’ (19%), ‘‘annual’’ (13%), and ‘‘sub-annual’’ (5%) types. General flowering type and temporal aggregation in reproductive events were commonly found among species in various categories of taxonomic groups, life forms, pollination systems, and fruit types. Possible causes for general flowering, such as promotion of pollination brought about by interspecific synchronization and paucity of climatic cues suitable for flowering trigger, are proposed, in addition to the predator satiation hypothesis of Janzen (1974).

TI  - Phenological studies of shrub and treelet species in tropical cloud forests of Costa Rica
PY  - 1988
AB  - (1) During 1978–1981, marked individuals of 107 species of treelets and shrubs in three forest types between 1300–1650 m elevation at Monteverde, Costa Rica, were monitored at monthly intervals for behaviour of leafing, flowering, and fruiting.(2) Although there was not a pronounced seasonal pattern of leafing activity, more species produced new leaves in the dry season. Species that flush large quantities of new leaves do so more commonly in the drier months. Leaf loss was gradual and unobtrusive in species observed.(3) Flowering activity was greatest in the late dry season and early wet season. Most species exhibited extended flowering; only 15% of the species were massively flowering. Massive flowerers showed less seasonality than extended flowerers.(4) Of the species studied, the majority had relatively unspecialized flowers which were visited by a variety of insects; small bee-pollination was the next most common, followed by hummingbird, beetle, settling moth, sphingid, butterfly, large bee and fly pollination (the pollination system of 18 species was unknown). Hummingbird pollinated species showed little seasonality of flowering when compared with species exhibiting small moth, and beetle pollination syndromes, as well as those with unspecialized flowers.(5) The vast majority of species studied have fleshy fruits (sarcochores). Fruiting activity was less markedly seasonal than flowering. Species with fruit are more numerous in the second half of the year (the wet season and early dry season). The second year of the study saw substantially fewer species in fruit than the first year; this is attributed to the greater than usual rainfall and inclement weather during the peak flowering season.(6) Cloud forest shrub and treelet phenology is compared with patterns of other forests that have been studied. In general, the greater the rainfall, the less seasonality of flowering and fruiting is seen. Although Monteverde is very wet, rainfall is intermediate between that of lowland dry and lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. Seasonality of flowering and fruiting at Monteverde is more pronounced than at La Selva (wet) and less obvious than in Guanacaste (dry).

TI  - Phylogenetic patterns among tropical flowering phenologies
PY  - 1995
AB  - 1 The ability of phylogenetic, water stress and 'shared-pollinator' hypotheses to explain flowering times was tested for the flora of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Both quantitative (217 species) and qualitative (1173 species) flowering data were used. 2 Descriptive metrics calculated from quantitative flowering data indicated that mean flowering times fell in the final two months of the dry season and the first two months of the wet season for 56% of species and that flowering was concentrated in a short, predictable part of the year for the great majority of species. 3 The 'shared-pollinator' hypothesis predicted that congeners should have temporally segregated flowering times. This hypothesis was rejected for 57 of 59 genera. 4 The water stress hypothesis predicted that species from drier habitats and life forms with limited access to soil water should flower in the wet season. This hypothesis was also rejected. 5 There were, however, strong phylogenetic patterns. Both the mean and the variance of flowering times were similar among congeners. The variance of flowering times was also similar among confamilials, and mean flowering times were concentrated in the wet season for monocotyledons.

TI  - Flowers and beetles in the South American tropics
PY  - 1990
AB  - Examples of beetle pollination in the South American tropics are given. The case histories refer to representatives of the families Cyclanthaceae, Annonaceae, and Araceae. In most cases the cantharophilous syndrome does not seem to be the result of coevolution but of a one-sided adaptation of flowers to the behavior, necessities, and sense-capacities of beetle species. It is emphasized that cantharophily may not necessarily be an indication of ancientness of a flower/insect relationship. Besides primitive angiosperms, there are derived and modern groups which, in their pollination, are specialized for beetles.



Carludovica palmata (Cyclanthaceae) is pollinated by small curculionids which are attracted by odors in the early morning hours. Annona coriacea (Annonaceae) and Philodendron selloum (Araceae) are pollinated by large dynastid scarab beetles in the evening hours. In all three species thermogenesis occurs. Although belonging to widely separate systematic groups, Annona flowers and Philodendron inflorescences have a similar pollination biology, which indicates that their adaptations to beetles are the result of convergent evolutionary developments.

TI  - Flora and reproductive phenology of the rain forest at Bukit Timah, Singapore
PY  - 1990
AB  - The 71 ha Bukit Timah Nature Reserve contains the largest surviving area of primary rain forest in Singapore. The recorded vascular plant flora of the forest consists of at least 854 species: 787 angiosperms in 109 families, 65 pteridophytes and three gymnosperms. 58.6% of the species are trees or shrubs, 18.7% climbers, 12.3% terrestrial herbs, 8.8% epiphytes and hemi-epiphytes, 1.0% saprophytes and 0.6% parasites. The four families with most species - Rubiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Orchidaceae and Moraceae - account for a quarter of the angio- sperm flora but contribute few large trees. Community reproductive phenology is charac- terized by supra-annual bursts of general flowering and fruiting, contrasting with a low back- ground level. After an exceptionally dry and sunny February, 1987, more than 150 species in 42 families flowered between late March and late May, followed by an equally well-defined fruiting peak 13 weeks later, between late June and late August.

TI  - Phenological changes in a Sumatran rain forest
PY  - 1986
AB  - Phenological observations were made in a Sumatran rain forest during three years (1980–1982). Phenological changes followed a consistent seasonal pattern. The abundance of young leaves and the fall of leaf litter peaked between December and February (first dry season); flowers were most abundant between January and April (first dry and first wet sea son), and ripe fruits in July-August (the second dry season). The fruit of strangling fig trees showed peaks in April and October, both wet season months. Within the study area there was variation in both the phase and the amplitude of the phenological cycles. One year, 1981, displayed mast flowering and fruiting. The observations indicate that the conditions for production were better during the mast year, a finding that facilitates our understanding of the evolution of mast fruiting.

TI  - Comparative Phenological Studies of Trees in Tropical Wet and Dry Forests in the Lowlands of Costa Rica
PY  - 1974
AB  - The dearth of plant phenological studies in tropical latitudes has been pointed out by various authors (Gibbs & Leston 1970; McClure 1966; Nevling 1971; Rees 1964). A review and brief evaluation of the few available investigations is presented by Frankie, Baker & Opler (1974). In most of these studies, a partial analysis of leafing, flowering or fruiting data is offered for a limited number of species and for limited time periods only. The results of a comparative phenological investigation of the trees in Wet and Dry forest sites in lowland Costa Rica are reported here. An attempt has been made to provide a unified analysis of the leafing, flowering, and fruiting periodicities of most species at both sites. The Wet forest site, Finca La Selva, is situated in the Atlantic watershed, while the Dry forest site, Comelco Property, is situated in the Pacific watershed. The study, which began in 1968, is part of a larger investigation aimed at analysing the biological organization of Wet and Dry forest ecosystems from the standpoint of plant reproductive biology. In this study the definition of a tree put forward by Lindley & Moore (1884, p. 1161) as 'any woody plant of perennial duration which rises from the ground with a trunk' has been adopted in part. To this we have added a minimum height qualification of approximately 3 m. We were unable to recognize distinct layers within the forest canopy at either site. Stratification, in which three or more tiers are generally designated, has been described by investigators working in various Tropical Rain forests (Beard 1955; Jones 1955; Lundell 1937; Richards 1952; Webb 1959). Other workers have been unable to discern definite layers clearly (Cain & Castro 1959; Grubb et al. 1963; Paijmans 1970; Schulz 1960). However, because trees are subject to different environmental conditions depending upon their position in the canopy and also for ease in recording data, tree species at the Wet forest site were arbitrarily divided into two categories: overstorey and understorey species. The first group consisted of canopy and subcanopy species, with the understorey comprising trees generally less than 15 m in height. Croat (1969) also divided trees at Barro Colorado Island into two layers for similar reasons. No layering effect was observed in the Dry forest and, because of the lesser tree heights, all trees in this forest were considered to belong to a single layer.

TI  - Six-Year Population Fluctuation of the Giant Honey Bee Apis dorsata (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in a Tropical Lowland Dipterocarp Forest in Sarawak
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract The giant honey bee Apis dorsata F. inhabits lowland tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia, where a general, community-wide flowering occurs at intervals of 4 yr on average. The numerical response by the honey bee population to the drastic increase of flower resources during general flowering was investigated for 6 yr by monthly light-trapping and by nest counts in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Borneo. The numbers of A. dorsata workers obtained by light-trapping were highest during general flowering periods, whereas very few workers were trapped in other periods. The abundance of A. dorsata nests showed temporal correspondence with the abundance of trapped workers, and the nests disappeared in the nonflowering periods. These data suggest that the A. dorsata population increases rapidly in response to general flowering and that this is initiated by nonseasonal, long-distance migration. Drones of A. dorsata were present during the general flowering period, but there is no evidence that reproduct...

TI  - On the Pollination Ecology of Ficus Sycomorus in East Africa
PY  - 1968
AB  - Pollination and seed setting in ficus sycomorus have been investigated in East Africa. Ficus sycomorus is monoecious, each fig bearing both male and female flowers. Inside the figs 6 sycophilous wasps develop: Ceratosolen arabicus, Ceratosolen galili and sycophaga sycomori (primary sycophiles), and Apocrypta sp., Eukoebelea sp. and Sycoryctes sp. (secondary sycophiles). The structure and behavior of these wasps and their bearing on pollination and seed productionare studied. Ceratosolen arabiacus is the legitimate pollinator of Ficus sycomorus. It oviposits chiefly into short—styled female flowers, thus ensuring seed setting in the long—styled ones. It is a mutualistic symbiont of the fig. Sycophaga sycomori oviposits into both short— and long—styled flowers, and does not cause seed setting. It is a competitor of Ceratosolen, but a parasite of the fig. Eukoebelea, Apocrypta and Sycoryctes are inquilines, making use of galls induced by the activity of the primary sycophiles. They do not interfere with seed production in pollinated flowers not occupied by Ceratosolen or Sycophaga.

TI  - Flowering and fruiting periodicity in a premontane rain forest in Pacific Colombia.
PY  - 1980
AB  - The timing and levels of flowering and fruiting were studied in a premontane rain forest in western Colombia. Flower production is less seasonal than fruit production, and periods of peak fruiting do not always closely follow the periods of higher flowering activity. Fruit production is more equitably distributed through the year than in seasonal tropical environments, but there are two small fruiting peaks that center on the wetter portions of the year. Proportionally fewer canopy species than understory species produce bird-dispersed fruits, and almost all understory trees produce this type of fruit. Species of Miconia fruit sequentially through the year, but the total number of individuals in fruit varies seasonally. This variation is apparently offset by an increase in fruiting activity of other trees as there is no marked seasonal depression in the availability of fruit for birds.

TI  - VARIATION IN THE PHENOLOGY OF NATURAL POPULATIONS OF MONTANE SHRUBS IN NEW ZEALAND
PY  - 1980
AB  - SUMMARY (1) Variation in flowering time of individuals in one population of each of three species of shrub was recorded over two growing seasons in montane scrub-grassland in the South Island of New Zealand. (2) There was considerable variation in flowering time within each popuLlation, but the flowering rank-order of individuals in different years was positively correlated. (3) Variation in flowering time was poorly correlated witlh the dLuration of flowering and the number of flowers and fruits per plant, except that variation in flowering time in Discaria toumatou (Rhamnaceae) was weakly positively correlated with the percentage fruit set in 1976-77. If both earlier and later flowering plants showed reduced fruit set this would suggest stabilizing selection, but there is no indication of such a pattern. Weak and inconsistent directional phenotypic selection for flowering time can be demonstrated for these two species however. (4) In the warm, dry summer of 1977-78, Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae) and Dracophyllumn spp. (Epacridaceae) flowered on average 9 days and 5 days earlier respectively and for 17 and 8 days shorter duration than in the cool, damp summer of 1976-77. Further, L. scoparium plants had a lower production of flowers and fruits in the second season in comparison with the first season. Plants of Discaria toumatou also flowered earlier in 1977-78, but the duration of flowering and flower and fruit production was greater in 1977-78 than in the 1976-77 season. (5) Patterns of variation in flowering time are also apparent among adjacent populations depending on altitude and on the major geographical units of the range of species. Variation in flowering time both at the individual and the population level may be an important adaptation by which selection and physiological mechanisms increase reproductive success.

TI  - Spatial Patterns in the Distribution of Tropical Tree Species
PY  - 2000
AB  - Fully mapped tree census plots of large area, 25 to 52 hectares, have now been completed at six different sites in tropical forests, including dry deciduous to wet evergreen forest on two continents. One of the main goals of these plots has been to evaluate spatial patterns in tropical tree populations. Here the degree of aggregation in the distribution of 1768 tree species is examined based on the average density of conspecific trees in circular neighborhoods around each tree. When all individuals larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were included, nearly every species was more aggregated than a random distribution. Considering only larger trees (≥ 10 centimeters in diameter), the pattern persisted, with most species being more aggregated than random. Rare species were more aggregated than common species. All six forests were very similar in all the particulars of these results.

TI  - Vertebrate Responses to Spatiotemporal Variation in Seed Production of Mast-Fruiting Dipterocarpaceae
PY  - 2000
AB  - To examine the interspecific reproductive synchrony of Dipterocarpaceae with vertebrate responses to seed availablity, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution and phenology of more than 2367 adult dipterocarp individuals of 54 species from March 1985 to January 1993 in the Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seven vegetational formations were sampled along an altitudinal gradient from peat swamp forest (5 m a.s.l. [above sea level]) across lowlands to upper montane zones (1100 m a.s.l.) that encompassed two upland valley complexes in a 15-km2 area. Four significant reproductive events were documented: (1) a common lowland species reproduced outside of mast events in 1986 and in 1990; (2) a localized lowland “minor” mast event in 1986 in which 24.3% of the adult trees (21 spp.) participated; (3) a major community-wide mast event (92.8%, 48 spp.) in 1987, just 6 mo after the minor event; and (4) another major community-wide mast fruiting event after a 4-yr intermast interval (88%, 48 spp.) in 1991. West Kalimantan export records of illipe nut (Dipterocarpaceae: Shorea section Pachycarpae) from 1968 to 1997 were compiled as a baseline measure of the frequency and relative intensity of dipterocarp mast-fruiting events in the region (cv = 152%). A “bumper crop” occurred about every 5 ± 2.6 yr (mean ± 1 sd; range 3–9 yr). Fruit production was significantly associated with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The 1987 and 1991 mast events monitored were the third and fourth largest export years in the province since 1968. Because of the disputed role of vertebrate seed predators in causing and maintaining mast-fruiting behavior, the response of seed-eating vertebrates to this spatiotemporal variation in dipterocarp seed production was examined. Seed of a common, but asynchronous, lowland species was largely consumed by vertebrates. In the 1986 minor mast, 21 dipterocarp species that produced 60 000 seeds/ha (dry mass 46 kg/ha) lost all monitored viable seed to a diversity of resident and nomadic vertebrate seed predators. Timed with dipterocarp seed production in all mast events, nomadic vertebrates increased their populations through both reproduction and regional movement (numerical response). However, in both the 1987 and 1991 mast events, resident vertebrates destroyed only 1.5% and 2.6% of community seed production, and predation was recorded only in the tails of the fruit-fall distribution. During these community mast events, resident vertebrates switched from dipterocarp seed to feed on fruit and seed from other available species. Nomadic vertebrates arrived late in the fruit-fall period during both major mast events and, thus, were able to destroy only seed dispersed in the final 1–3 wk of fruit-fall. Seed escape, and thus regeneration, only occurred in major mast events when all dipterocarp species across large areas participated. Considerable seedling recruitment was recorded in both the 1987 (∼95 000 seedlings/ha) and 1991 (155 824 ± 36 764 seedlings/ha) mast events. Results from this natural experiment indicate that resident and nomadic vertebrates cause stabilizing selection for tight interspecific synchrony of dipterocarp seedfall over vast regions. Although the pattern generally conformed to the predator-satiation hypothesis, the observed mechanisms for seed escape within a mast-fruiting event did not. Resident and nomadic vertebrate foraging and ranging patterns resulted in dipterocarp seed “escape” rather than local “swamping” with copious seed production per se. To account for these observations, two hypotheses, “interfamilial satiation” and “regional escape,” were developed. The period of seed availability and length of the regional intermast interval is examined with seed-predator reproduction and behavior to assess the impact of seed availability on seed-predator populations. The importance of rare events and appropriate spatial scale for investigating evolutionary and ecological processes such as mast fruiting are addressed.

PY  - 1996
AB  - The phenology of 568 trees of 49 species producing fleshy fruits was studied in a montane forest in Rwanda between January 1991 and January 1993. Fruiting peaked during the major wet season in March-May, but remained high during the major dry season in July-August. A period of reduced fruiting occurred in the beginning of each calendar year during the minor dry period. Leaf flushing peaked during the major dry season in July-August, whereas flowering peaked in the beginning of each calendar year. These observations were inconsistent with the general pattern predicted by an "insolation-limitation hypothesis" that community-wide flowering and leaf flushing in tropical forests should be closely related in time and that both phenophases reach their peaks during the period of the most intense insolation. When species were grouped by seed size, the large-seeded group displayed a greater temporal variation in fruit abundance (greater fruiting seasonality) than the small-seeded group. When species were examined individually, however, seed size was not related to either fruiting duration or within-species fruiting synchrony, two attributes determining the degree of fruiting seasonality of a species. Fruiting patterns manifested by a group thus could not be explained by attributes from species constituting the group. Different degrees of fruiting seasonality displayed by different seed-sized groups may be due to different degrees of within-group interspecific fruiting synchrony.

TI  - Reproductive phenology of a tropical dry forest in Mudumalai, Southern India
PY  - 1994
AB  - 1 Flowering and fruiting phenologies of a tropical dry forest in Mudumalai, southern India, were studied between April 1988 and August 1990. Two sites, a wetter site I receiving 1100mm and a drier site II receiving 600mm of rainfall annually, are compared. A total of 286 trees from 38 species at site I and 167 trees from 27 species at site II was marked for phenological observations. There were 11 species common to the two sites. Several hypotheses relating to the evolution of reproductive phenology are tested.

2 Frequency of species flowering attained a peak at site I during the dry season but at site II, where soil moisture may be limiting during the dry months, the peak was during the wet season. At both sites a majority of species flushed leaves and flowered simultaneously. Among various guilds, the bird-pollinated guild showed distinct dry season flowering, which may be related to better advertisement of large flowers to pollinators during the leafless dry phase. The wind-pollinated guild flowered mainly during the wet season, when wind speeds are highest and favourable for pollen transport. The insect-pollinated guild showed no seasonality in flowering in site I but a wet season flowering in site II.

3 Fruiting frequency attained a peak in site I during the late wet season extending into the early dry season; a time-lag correlation showed that fruiting followed rainfall with a lag of about two months. Site II showed a similar fruiting pattern but this was not statistically significant. The dispersal guilds (animal, wind, and explosive passively-dispersed) did not show any clear seasonality in fruiting, except for the animal-dispersed guild which showed wet season fruiting in site I.

4 Hurlbert's overlap index was also calculated in order to look at synchrony in flowering and fruiting irrespective of climatic (dry and wet month) seasonality. In general, overlap in flowering and fruiting guilds was high because of seasonal aggregation. Among the exceptions, at site II the wind-pollinated flowering guild did not show significant overlap between species although flowering aggregated in the wet season. This could be due to the need to avoid heterospecific pollen transfer.

5 Rarer species tended to flower earlier in the dry season and this again could be an adaptation to avoid the risk of heterospecific pollen transfer or competition for pollinators. The more abundant species flowered mainly during the wet season. Species which flower earlier have larger flowers and, having invested more energy in flowers, also have shorter flower to fruit durations.

TI  - Are large predators keystone species in Neotropical forests ? The evidence from Barro Colorado Island.
PY  - 1994
AB  - Large cats have been hypothesized to act as keystone predators in Neotropical forests by limiting mid-sized terrestrial mammals, which in turn control forest regeneration. The evidence for this is based predominantly on cross-site comparisons involving Cosha Cashu (CC), Peru, with its complete predator complement, and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, where puma and jaguar are no longer residents. We reevaluate the evidence in light of 725 km of transect censuses performed on BCI, comparisons with additional sites throughout the Neotropics, and historical changes in the BCI mammal fauna. Several mid-sized species showed habituation to humans near the BCI laboratory compound (where previous censuses had been carried out), indicating that cross-site comparisons, despite using similar methodologies, may be biased by differentially meeting technique assumptions, and that densities of these species at BCI and CC may not differ as greatly as previously assumed. Analyses of additional sites also indicate that individual species population density estimates for BCI, while high for several species, are not extreme. Cross-site analyses indicate that most, but not all, species show no significant difference in mean densities at sites with and without large cats. On the other hand, an evaluation of the qualitative historical evidence indicates that as cats were eliminated from BCI by poaching, many potential prey species population densities increased. These increases were not sustained, however, and may reflect natural population variability rather than the status of large cats. Finally, we examine the evidence for prey species controlling forest regeneration. While extreme removal of herbivorous and frugivorous mammals will profoundly affect forest regeneration, the effects of slight decreases in densities, or the effects of increased densities (as implicated by the keystone predator hypothesis) are equivocal.

TI  - Pollination biology in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. I. Characteristics of the plant-pollinator community in a lowland dipterocarp forest
PY  - 1998
AB  - Flowerings and flower visitors were observed continuously in alowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia, for 53 mo in1992-1996. Flower visitors of 270 plant species were observed orcollected, and pollinators were assessed by observing body contact tostigmas and anthers. We recognized 12 categories of pollination systems.Among them, plants pollinated by social bees included the largest numberof species (32%) and were followed by beetle-pollinated species(20%). Pollination systems were significantly related with somefloral characters (flowering time of day, reward, and floral shape), butnot with floral color. Based on the relationships between pollinatorsand floral characters, we described pollination syndromes found in alowland dipterocarp forest. The dominance of social bees and beetlesamong pollinators is discussed in relation to the general floweringobserved in dipterocarp forests of West Malesia. In spite of high plantspecies diversity and consequent low population densities of lowlanddipterocarp forests, long-distance-specific pollinators were uncommoncompared with theNeotropics.

TI  - Pollen Production and Plant Density Affect Pollination and Seed Production in Taxus Canadensis
PY  - 1990
AB  - Mean pollen production and mean nearest neighbor distance were recorded for several populations of Taxus canadensis and correlated with the proportion of ovules pollinated and seed set. Distance and pollen production together explained 86% of the variation in pollination success, each variable significantly adding to the regression when adjusting for the other. Seed set was correlated significantly with pollen production and nearest neighbor distance separately, but the multiple regression including the latter two variables was not significant. Seed set was correlated most strongly with pollination success and mean ovule production (R2 = 0.71), suggesting that variation in seed set among Taxus populations was a combination of differences in pollen and resource availability.

TI  - Experimental Tests of the Spatiotemporal Scale of Seed Predation in Mast-Fruiting Dipterocarpaceae
PY  - 2000
AB  - Mast-fruiting Dipterocarpaceae exhibit highly synchronous, interspecific seedfall at irregular, multiyear intervals. To investigate how the temporal pattern of seedfall affects dipterocarp seed and seedling survival, in both a logged and a primary lowland tropical forest, we planted Shorea stenoptera Burck seeds in the last three weeks of a 12-wk synchronous dipterocarp seedfall during a major community mast-fruiting event in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. As a result of commercial timber harvest of dipterocarp individuals eight years before, total dipterocarp seed production in the logged site was only 23% of that in the primary forest. At both sites, an average of 35 kg of seed was sown across a large area (≥1 km2) to examine the spatial pattern of seed destruction. During the period in which “natural” community mast seed was available to predators, 92% and 99% of experimentally sown seed escaped predators in logged and in primary forest, respectively. After regional seed resources were exhausted, nomadic vertebrates (primarily the bearded pig, Sus barbatus) were observed in both forest areas, and all ungerminated seed was destroyed. Seed predators arrived earlier in the logged area, before most experimentally sown seed had germinated, and the logged site experienced greater seed loss to vertebrates than did the primary forest. Because nomadic seed predators were absent during peak fruit fall of naturally occurring communities at both study sites, there was no evidence of local predator satiation. Rather, experimentally sown seed escaped predation because of rapid germination before predator arrival, as opposed to being ignored by satiated predators. Seed escape was more dependent on the late arrival of pigs than on the amount of local seed production. There was no significant spatial autocorrelation of seed predation. All remaining seed at the scale of the experiment (>1 km2) was destroyed by predators. These findings suggest that satiation of nomadic predators occurs at the landscape scale. Postdispersal seed predators caused significantly greater seed destruction in the experimentally sown seed populations than in naturally dispersed, mast-fruiting communities at both sites. In both logged and primary forests, there was significantly greater loss of experimentally sown seed to predation than was found in the entire natural mast-fruiting Shorea community combined (21 spp.). Moreover, a naturally occurring, but late-fruiting, Shorea species also exhibited greater seed losses to predation than did all other species within each mast-fruiting community, and these proportional losses were similar to those observed in the experimentally sown seeds. Seeds that escaped predation and vertebrate herbivory on post-establishment seedlings displayed high survival, indicating that the availability of suitable microsites did not limit recruitment. In the primary forest, 65% of the germinated experimental seed that survived early causes of mortality was alive 40 mo post-planting, which coincided with the next mast-fruiting event. The spatial distribution of these seedlings was modified primarily by the foraging behavior of vertebrate seed predators in the first two weeks post-planting. The influence of vertebrate predation on seed and seedling survival suggests that foraging behavior by terrestrial vertebrate seed predators may cause directional and/or stabilizing selection for synchronous, interspecific supra-annual dipterocarp seed production across forest regions in Kalimantan.

TI  - The mechanism of general flowering in Dipterocarpaceae in the Malay Peninsula
PY  - 1999
AB  - The mechanism of general flowering in Dipterocarpaceae in the Malay Peninsula is revealed through field survey and meteorological data analyses. The regions of general flowering coincide with those which experienced a low night-time temperature (LNT) c. 2 mo before flowering. This supports the hypo- thesis that low air temperature induces the development of floral buds of diptero- carps. LNT was found to be caused by radiative cooling during dry spells in winter when the northern subtropical ridge (STR) occasionally migrates southwards with a dry air mass into the equatorial region. LNT events usually occur in La Nifia episodes, not in El Nifio episodes as believed previously. This is because the south- ward migration of the STR is associated with the intensification of local meridional Hadley Circulation in the western Pacific, which is strengthened in a La Nifia episode. Results suggest that El Nifio-like climate change in increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations may be critical for the tropical rain forest biome in south-east Asia.

TI  - Weasel Population Response, Home Range, and Predation on Rodents in a Deciduous Forest in Poland
PY  - 1995
AB  - Numerical responses of the weasel Mustela nivalis to the changes in population density of forest rodents (bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus and yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis) and predation by weasels were studied in the pristine deciduous forests of Bialowieza National Park, eastern Poland, in 1985 through 1992. The rodents experienced 5 yr of noncyclic (seasonal) fluctuations (autumn density 23-74 rodents/ha) and 2 yr of outbreak and crash (triggered by synchronous heavy crop of oak, hornbeam, and maple seeds). Autumn numbers of rodents exceeded 300 individuals/ha during the outbreak and dropped to 8 individuals/ha in the following autumn. Weasels were censused by livetrapping in summer and by snowtracking on an 11.2-km 2 grid of transects in winter. Radiotracking of 12 weasels in 1990 and 1991 yielded estimates of home ranges and daily movement distances, which were combined with snowtracking and livetrapping data to estimate densities during 7 yr. Estimated winter density of weasels varied from 5.2 to 27.3 individuals/10 km 2 in December and declined to 0-19.1 individuals/10 km 2 by early spring (March). Midsummer (July/August) indices of weasel numbers were extremely variable and corresponded to 41.9-47.6 individuals/10 km 2 in years with moderate density of rodents, 101.7 individuals/10 km 2 during the rodent outbreak and 19.1 individuals/10 km 2 during the crash. Increase of weasel numbers from spring to midsummer was positively related to the spring numbers of rodents. Autumn and winter decline of weasel numbers was not related to rodent density changes. During the outbreak and crash of the rodent population, the numbers of weasels and rodents (both sampled at 2-3 mo intervals) were positively correlated (P < 0.0005) with no time lag. Home ranges of male weasels radiotracked during the rodent outbreak were 11-37 ha (minimum convex polygon), compared to 117-216 ha during the crash year. The predator/prey ratio varied from 0 to 2.5 weasels/1000 rodents. The ratio was highest at low densities of rodents. With increasing numbers of rodents, the ratio declined, since rodent population growth was overwhelmingly faster than weasel population growth. In the 7 autumn-winter seasons (1 October-15 April), weasels removed, on average, 1.6 to 9.5 rodents from each hectare, i.e., from 2 to 28% of autumn numbers of rodents. Winter predation by weasels was heaviest at rodent density of 20 individuals/ha. At lower densities of rodents, the number of weasels was restricted by food shortage and the role of their predation rapidly declined. At high rodent densities, the rodent numbers by far exceeded the predatory capacity of weasels and predation percentage declined again. Weasel predation in relation to rodent density has the same pattern in geographic zones ranging from Turkmen deserts to European farmlands and forests.

TI  - Comparisons of Population Dynamics of Peromyscus and Clethrionomys in New England
PY  - 1977
AB  - Population dynamics of Clethrionomys and Peromyscus were studied in northern Vermont (March 1963 to July 1966) and central Connecticut (July 1964 to August 1967; supplemented by spot-check data from July 1962 to August 1963 and September 1968). The Connecticut study area included swamp and upland habitats; the Vermont area included only uplands. P. leucopus and C. gapperi displayed an annual cycle of abundance in the Connecticut swamp. C. gapperi and P. maniculatus in Vermont and P. leucopus in the Connecticut uplands displayed periodic peaks of abundance (approximately 2 to 3 year intervals in Connecticut). Greater fluctuation in food supply in the uplands than in the swamp appeared responsible for such differences in annual abundances of Peromyscus and Clethrionomys , at least in Connecticut. P. leucopus population densities were much lower in the swamp than in the upland; lower food availability in swamps as compared to uplands is assumed the primary factor involved. Survival of C. gapperi was slightly greater than that of P. leucopus ; this may account for higher overall densities of C. gapperi observed in this study. Seasonal trends in survival were the same for both species with survival highest during the winter months. Survival of P. leucopus in the swamp was only slightly less than that of the upland population. Survival of C. gapperi in a coniferous area of the swamp was greater than that in a deciduous area, possibly due to differences in diurnal avian predation. There was a negative correlation between population density and survival of C. gapperi ; a similar, but nonsignificant, trend was observed for P. leucopus . Reproduction of both species reached a peak in May to July; lowest levels of reproduction were observed in January. There was no correlation between population density and reproduction of either species. Length of the previous winter nonbreeding season appeared to be the primary factor influencing population densities reached a given year by both species.

TI  - Population Ecology and Energy Relationships of Clethrionomys gapperi in a Colorado Subalpine Forest
PY  - 1978
AB  - Small mammals were live-trapped on a 12 by 12 study grid (1.2 ha) located in a subalpine forest on the eastern slope of the Colorado Front Range at an elevation of 3,120 m. The area was characterized by a continental climate, and snow covered the ground for about 7½ months of the year. Subnivean activity of Clethrionomys gapperi was monitored by use of live-traps located within trap chimneys. The population was monitored at 2-week intervals from January 1974 to September 1975. Population density of mice increased during summer, peaked in late November and then gradually declined to a low in May during spring thaw. Two periods of hardship existed for red-backed voles in the study area—the autumn freeze and spring thaw. The autumn freeze occurred before snow accumulation, which reduced survival. The spring thaw produced extensive flooding, which caused high mortality.

Red-backed voles commenced breeding in late March below a continuous snow cover (150 to 200 cm deep). The breeding season lasted about 7½ months. Pregnant females caught in June produced another litter that summer. Voles concluded breeding in September and lactating females were caught in October. Winter-caught red-backed voles weighed significantly less and also showed a lower per gram metabolic rate than the larger summer mice. Winter weight loss seemed advantageous in reducing food requirements as verified by metabolic studies. Small mammals in the subalpine forest ecosystem are not simply primary consumers, their role is complex and derived from numerous “strategies” adaptive in coping with the harsh subalpine environment.

TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF ACORN CROPS ON ANNUAL VARIATION IN RODENT AND BIRD POPULATIONS
PY  - 2000
AB  - I recorded mast production by oaks (Quercus sp.) at 12 forested sites in western Virginia for 6–12 yr and measured its impact on the abundance of small mammals, understory vegetation, and artificial-nest predation. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were excluded from half the 4-ha sites after at least one season of data collection. My hypothesis was that annual variation in acorn crops affected multiple species and that the strength of those interactions is mediated by white-tailed deer.

The acorn crop was variable across sites and year, with some of the between-site variability explained by differences in elevation. All sites experienced at least one mast failure, and mast failure years were generally consistent across sites. White-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), and gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) populations were significantly correlated with annual fluctuations in the acorn crop. The exclusion of deer had a significant impact on P. leucopus and T. striatus populations by increasing the number of animals captured following low acorn mast years.

Annual fluctuations in the acorn crop, but not in rodent densities, were significantly correlated with the rates of predation on artificial nests the next summer. There was no significant interaction between predation rates and the exclusion of deer. An index from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) for Virginia was used to measure regional numbers for 11 common species captured at the sites. The index for two understory species was significantly negatively correlated with the mean acorn crop measured 2 yr previously. The effect of white-tailed deer on the forest community was not consistent across all conditions, as sites with large acorn crops were not strongly influenced by deer. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast crops from oaks serve as important determinants of community function within Appalachian forests.

TI  - Ecology of Eastern White Pine Seed Caches made by Small Forest Mammals
PY  - 1970
AB  - Typical seed caches made in the fall of the year by white—footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and red—backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) contained 20—30 pine seeds, buried beneath the litter of pine needles and in contact with mineral soil. Many caches were revisited by the mice and their contents destroyed before winter. Most caches not decimated in the fall were invaded the following spring. However, some of them escaped complete destruction and their unconsumed seeds germinated and produced seedlings. Although mice make their caches in micro—environments highly favorable to germination, their subsequent feedings on the stored seeds, both before snowfall and before and during the spring germination period, greatly deplete the number of potential germinants. Therefore, the contribution to forest regeneration of seeds stored by these small forest mammals is probably of minor significance except when bumper seed crops are produced and large numbers of caches are created. Under these circumstances, stored seeds may be of sufficient quantity to exceed food requirements of the mice. If pirating by other animals is low, then a surplus of seeds is left to help regenerate the forest.

TI  - Coexistence of Specialist and Generalist Rodents Via Habitat Selection
PY  - 1996
AB  - Habitat specialization is an effective mechanism of coexistence among com- peting species. But many communities also include generalized species whose habitat use overlaps that of the specialists. Two hypotheses seem most likely to account for the pattern: (1) Habitat generalists may coexist in competitively structured communities by exploiting habitats unused, or underused, by habitat specialists. (2) Population densities of the spe- cialized species may be limited (e.g., by predation) below levels where the specialists can competitively exclude habitat generalists. I evaluated these ideas in a community of small mammals occupying mesic and xeric habitats at nine different locations in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, Canada. A chipmunk generalist coexists with two specialists, one with a distinct preference for xeric habitat (deer mouse), and another with a similar preference for mesic habitat (red-backed vole). Habitat selection appeared to depend pri- marily on the density of conspecifics. The generalist coexisted by responding to habitat at a larger scale than did the specialists. Shared predators, whose habitat selection operates on a larger scale than that of their prey, may augment coexistence of all species by rein- forcing habitat selection by the specialists.

PY  - 1976
AB  - Mont St. Hilaire has an area of about 10 km2 covered by sugar maple and beech forest. Longworth traps were used on 46 grids from 1966 to 1976 in the snow-free period, mainly in June. One thousand and fifty-one individuals of 10 species of small mammals were captured. Two-thirds of these were Peromyscus, mainly P. maniculatus. Six female and one male Microtus pennsylvanicus were captured, all at least 1000 m from the nearest grassland, which is the usual habitat of this species.Within the forest the species apparently do not segregate into different habitats. Distribution, as measured by the number of grids on which each species was captured, is a function of total numbers. The relationship holds intraspecifically and interspecifically. Peromyscus (species combined), Clethrionomys gapperi, and Blarina brevicauda varied in June numbers from year to year. The range of variation was greatest for Peromyscus. Numbers of Peromyscus and Clethrionomys did not vary synchronously, and neither showed evidence of a re...

TI  - Ecological and evolutionary interactions between reproduction of beech Fagus silvatica and seed eating animals.
PY  - 1985
AB  - Patterns of beech seed production, seedling establishment, sapling densities, and sapling mortalities were studied in several forests dominated by different tree species. In a beech dominated forest, seed production and seedling establishment were negatively correlated in space. Seedlings became established mainly where there was least canopy coverage of mature beeches. Vertebrate seed predation was low in a year with an abundant seed crop but relatively higher in a year with a moderate crop. In the latter year predispersal insect seed predation was about 39%. I suggest that mast seeding in trees is more effective in reducing seed predation by insects than by vertebrates. Data in the literature support this prediction. The mortality rates of saplings and small trees of beech and oak were higher below mature trees of their own species than below trees of other species. In a spruce forest without mature oaks and beeches there was a high density and low mortality of saplings and small trees of the latter two species. Evidence suggests that the jay Garrulus glandarius had dug down the acorns and beech nuts. The jay appears to store beech mast only when no acorns are available. This situation occurred in the study area in 3 out of 13 years. The jay seems to be one of the species that could have dispersed the beech northwards during the Holocene.

TI  - Competition and niche shifts of mice introduced onto small islands
PY  - 1976
AB  - Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner) and Clethrionomys gapperi (Vigors) were introduced to a 0.8 ha island to which only Microrus pennsylvanicus (Ord) was native in order to study subsequent interactions. The populations were censused for the ensuing six summers. Although all three species occupied overlapping home ranges in some habitats, there were significant differences in their habitat preferences. Principal component analysis of number of captures of the respective species at 45 trap-sites showed that habitat utilization changed with time in response to changes in intraand interspecific densities. Multiple regression was used to estimate the magnitude of interspecific interference after removal of effects due to habitat selection. Clethrionomys displaced both Microrus and Peromyscus from wooded habitats, and Peromyscus in turn displaced Microtus from shrubby habitats. The magnitude of this interference increased with population density, and the inhibitory effects per individual at maximum observed densities were as follows: Clethrionomys on Microtus -0.649, and Clethrionomys on Peromyscus -0.443, and Peromyscus on Microtus -0.662. The reciprocal effects were close to zero. We suggest that the success of Microtus on islands accrues from its ability as an opportunist, while the failure of Clethrionomys on islands is attributable to its rigid and restricted habitat preferences.

TI  - RODENT OCCURRENCE, HABITAT DISTURBANCE, AND SEED FALL IN A LARCH-FIR FOREST'
PY  - 1982
AB  - Small-mammal population changes were measured for 5 yr (1970-1974) by live trapping on broadcast burned western larch (Larix occidentalis)IDouglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) clear-cuts and in uncut timber on a north and a south slope in western Montana. Four species comprised 96% of the 1324 animals caught: deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) 42%, red-backed voles (Clethrio- nomys gapperi) 27%, red-tailed chipmunks (Eutamias ruficaudus) 22%, and long-tailed voles (Micro- tus longicaudus) 5%. Deer mice and chipmunks were common on clear-cut and timber plots. The red- backed vole and long-tailed voles were associated with moist sites but showed local allopatry. The red-backed voles were present only under tree canopy and the long-tailed vole was found only in absence of tree canopy. A hard burn effect was to eliminate most of the organic mantle and all small mammals except deer mice, who existed as the single species for 2 yr, and as 80-90% of numbers for 5 postburn yr. A light burn which left duff intact was associated with retention of species diversity and a low initial postburn (2 yr) mammal population, followed by the largest increases. Numbers of deer mice varied inversely with numbers of red-backed voles in the timber. Deer mice increased sharply on all plots the first fall after a heavy conifer seed crop, an occurrence reported by other workers. From these pattern observations it is theorized that red-backed voles may dominate deer mice, but a heavy seed crop can temporarily enhance competitive standing of deer mice. An open, xeric, pioneering situation (hard burn) was conducive to persistently high deer mouse populations. The most obvious habitat feature associated with an inverse spatial relationship between the two voles was tree canopy. The long-tailed vole may be further discriminated against by drier habitats. Clear-cutting appeared to be the principal determinant of total population size, but burn intensity seemed to influ- ence species composition.

TI  - Population Fluctuations of Mast-Eating Rodents Are Correlated with Production of Acorns
PY  - 1996
AB  - I used a 14-year dataset on dynamics of mast-consuming rodents from an eastern deciduous forest to determine the relationship between population fluctuations of white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ), deer mice ( P. maniculatus ), and eastern chipmunks ( Tamias stria-tus ) and production of acorn mast. Mast (acorn) production was episodic with four excellent crops produced in 14 years. Densities of rodents in summer ranged from 3 to 103 animals/ha and correlated positively with production of mast the previous autumn (all r 2 > 0.56). During years of high production of mast, stores of acorn lasted throughout winter, whereas in most years, acorns were gone by January. During years of high production of mast, mice bred all winter, which resulted in high densities the following summer. Episodic production of mast and resulting fluctuations in consumers of mast have implications for the predator-satiation hypothesis and other community processes.

TI  - Seed dispersal and colonization in a disturbed northern hardwood forest
PY  - 1988
AB  - HUGHES, J. W. AND T. J. FAHEY (Dept. of Natural Resources, Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY 14853). Seed dispersal and colonization in a disturbed northern hardwood forest. Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 115: 89-99. 1988.-Seed dispersal and seedling establishment of three dominant tree species were studied on disturbed and undisturbed sites for 3 years (1984-1986) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. In the undisturbed northern hardwood forest, year-to-year variation in seed production was smaller for a large-seeded species (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) than for species with small (Betula alleghaniensis Brit.) or mediumsized seeds (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and production of seeds by the latter two species differed by several orders of magnitude between years. Recruitment of seedlings into the forest understory correlated with differences in seed input. Seed production of B. alleghaniensis, F. grandifolia and A. saccharum in the undisturbed forest in 1984-1985 (a good seed year) was 9297, 59, and 264 seeds m-2, respectively. Recruitment the following growing season was 39.8, 2.2, and 18.7 seedlings m-2, respectively. The pattern of revegetation by seedlings on a disturbance 205 m wide and 21.9 ha in area was strongly influenced by dispersal of seeds. Seed input and seedling establishment declined exponentially with distance from the disturbance edge for A. saccharum, with no appreciable colonization occurring beyond 15 m from the forest edge even during a good seed year. Seeds of F. grandifolia rarely were dispersed into the disturbed area, and this was reflected in very low seedling recruitment. Dispersal of B. alleghaniensis seeds declined exponentially from the edge and seedling establishment was highest near the edge (47 m-2), decreasing to 10 m-2 at 25 m from the forest edge, and remaining relatively constant at 5 seedlings m-2 in central parts of the disturbance. Seedling recruitment for all three species was restricted to sites where seeds were deposited the preceding year, suggesting that few seeds of those species persisted in the seed bank more than 1 year. As a result, colonization by seedlings and subsequent species composition of the forest opening were greatly influenced by the seed crops immediately preceding and following the disturbance.

AB  - Clethrionomys gapperi and Napaeozapus insignis are shown to consume quantities of most of the more common fleshy fruits found in the mixed deciduous forest of the mid-Laurentians of Quebec, based on consumption at forest feeding stations. Differences in preferences among the fruits are small. Both rodents tend to return to known food sources and increase both activity and food consumption with increased food density. Functional response to food density is slightly better fitted by the disc equation than by linear regression.

TI  - Relationships between Seed Fall of Three Tree Species and Peromyscus leucopus and Clethrionomys gapperi during 10 Years in an Oak-Pine Forest
PY  - 1999
AB  - We analyzed live-trapping data from 10 years (1983-1992) of a long-term study of forest ecosystems in southern Maine to investigate relationships between seed fall of red oak (Quercus rubra), white pine (Pinus strobus), and red maple (Acer rubrum), and populations of Peromyscus leucopus and Clethrionomys gapperi. Spring populations of Peromyscus were correlated positively with crops of both red oak and white pine in the previous autumn; summer populations were correlated only with the acorn crop of red oak in the previous year. Populations of Clethrionomys were not correlated with either red oak or white pine in spring or summer. The increase from spring to summer in Peromyscus was associated positively with the magnitude of seed fall from red maple in the current year. Following years of above average acorn production of red oak, adult male and female Peromyscus weighed more than in years following low acorn production. Following 2 years of high acorn production, captures of Peromyscus were associated positively with the number of live red oaks >10 cm diameter at breast height per 0.25-ha quadrat. Group-selection logging also was associated with increased summer captures of Peromyscus per quadrat for 2 of 4 years, probably due to an increase in both herbaceous cover and fruit production of shrubs.

TI  - Effects of climate on reproductive investment in a masting species: Assessment of climatic predictors and underlying mechanisms
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary 1. Mechanisms by which climatic factors drive reproductive investment and phenology in masting species are not completely understood. Climatic conditions may act as a proximate cue, stimulating the onset of reproduction and indirectly increasing fitness through benefits associated with synchronous reproduction among individuals. Alternatively, climatic conditions may directly influence individual-level allocation to reproduction and reproductive success through effects occurring independently of synchronous reproduction. We previously showed that masting in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) population was strongly influenced by spring mean temperature 2 years before seed cone maturation (Ti-2). However, recent work shows that the difference in temperature between previous growing seasons (DT) is more predictive of reproductive investment in long-lived tree species. 2. Here, we compared four candidate models that predict seed cone production in P. ponderosa based upon different climatic factors (including Ti-2 and DT models). After determining the best climatic predictor, we tested for a potential mechanism by which climate might directly influence seed cone production independent of benefits via synchrony, namely effects of temperature on trade-offs between current and past reproduction (determined by underlying resource availability). 3. We found that Ti-2 (rather than DT) was the best predictor of seed cone production. We further show that this same climatic factor exerts a direct fitness benefit to individuals by reducing the strength of trade-offs between current and past reproductive efforts. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that a single climatic factor provides fitness benefits to individuals directly, by weakening reproductive trade-offs, and indirectly through the benefits associated with synchrony and masting. This suggests a mechanism for the origin and maintenance of masting: individuals initially respond to climatic cues that directly enhance reproduction (e.g. lower reproductive costs through weakened trade-offs) and this dynamic, expressed across multiple individuals, reinforces these benefits through the economies of scale associated with synchrony and masting.

TI  - Spatial patterns of acorn dispersal by rodents: do acorn crop size and ungulate presence matter?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Seed dispersal is qualitatively effective when it increases recruitment probability. A poorly studied factor likely affecting recruitment is the spatial distribution of dispersed seeds. Seed-caching animals are thought to disperse seeds in a way that reduces clumping and density to impede cache pilfering. Furthermore, dispersal might differ depending on whether the seed is immediately consumed versus cached for later consumption, and might differ depending on the ecological context. The main objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the spatial pattern of seed dispersal by rodents in a heterogeneous environment; 2) whether the patterns differ among years and among acorn competitor exclosure treatments, and 3) whether rodents create different spatial patterns of dispersal for acorns that are cached versus consumed immediately following dispersal. We studied the degree of spatial aggregation of acorn dispersal by rodents using two different estimators derived from the Ripley K and the Diggle G functions. We also analyzed various metrics of dispersal distances. For both analyses we used observed acorn dispersal patterns in two years differing in crop size and inside versus outside exclosures restricting access to acorn-consuming ungulates. During 2003, a year with a larger crop size, maximum seed dispersal distances were less, and the pattern of dispersed seeds was more clumped, than in 2004, a year with a smaller crop size. Median dispersal distances did not differ between years. In the presence of ungulates, seed dispersal was marginally sparser than in their absence. Cached acorns were dispersed more sparsely than acorns eaten immediately. These results have important implications for the quality of seed dispersal for oak recruitment that are likely relevant to other systems as well.

TI  - Variation in annual pollen accumulation rates of Fagus along a N-S transect in Europe based on pollen traps
PY  - 2010
AB  - Annual pollen-accumulation rates (PAR) of Fagus (beech) obtained within the framework of the Pollen Monitoring Programme (PMP) were analyzed in pollen traps along a N–S transect from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea in different European vegetation units. The study regions are situated in the lowlands of northern Poland, the uplands of SE Poland, the Czech Krkonose Mts, the Czech Sumava Mts, the Swiss Jura Mts, the Swiss Alps, the Bulgarian Rila Mts and the Bulgarian Strandzha Mts. Most time series are 10 or 11 years long, some are 5–16 years long. Inter-annual fluctuations in Fagus PAR were analyzed and compared with seed mast years. Years with high Fagus PAR and others with low Fagus PAR occurred most frequently in parallel within each region and often in two neighbouring regions. 2006 was exceptional as it had a very high Fagus sylvatica pollen deposition in all study regions and it was also a mast year. In Bulgaria, the trend in the 5 years of Fagus orientalis PAR in the Strandzha Mts differed from that of F. sylvatica PAR in the Rila Mts. Aiming at establishing the relationship between average Fagus PAR and tree cover, differences in Fagus PAR (averaged per pollen trap) were related in each region to the proportion of beech trees in the vegetation within 2 km of the pollen traps, the distance to the nearest pollinating Fagus tree, regional or local presence of beech forests, the degree of landscape openness, and the size of forest opening in which a trap is situated. Average Fagus PAR was found to track the regional abundance of beech trees in the vegetation, not the distance of the nearest Fagus tree. Regional occurrence of beech-dominated forests was reflected by a Fagus PAR of ca. 1,400 grains cm−2 year−1, local abundance very close to pollen traps by ca. 2,400 grains, small patches of forest with admixture of Fagus by ca. 170–220 grains, and scarcity or absence of Fagus by ca. 40 grains or less.

TI  - A sixteen-year record of regional and temporal variation in the fruiting of beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.) in England (1980–;1995)
PY  - 1997
AB  - Summary Annual production of mast by the beech is highly variable, yet there are few long-term records of the extent of masting which might help to explain the masting phenomenon. In this 16-year study, beech mast has been sampled from 100 trees by 7-min samples collected from the ground and from low-growing branches at sites ranging from the south to the north of England, and varying from closed canopy beechwood to shelter belts, avenues and isolated trees in parks. Variation in production of viable seed is much greater from year to year than from north to south. Good masting occurred in 1980, 1982, 1984, 1990 and 1995: in these years at least one year of very bad masting normally followed. Otherwise, prediction of masting is unreliable. No full mast was found in 1981. Overall there was very little full mast in five other years, but even in these years, some sites or some trees produced an appreciable amount. All trees produced empty pericarps as well as full mast, especially on lower or shaded branches. Isolated trees produced more empty pericarps than trees in groups; this is likely to result from a lack of cross pollination. It is concluded that ground sampling for a fixed period affords a rapid and effective method of assessing masting despite the factors intervening between mast shedding and collection.

TI  - Scatterhoarding Rodents and Tree Regeneration
PY  - 2001
AB  - Tree seeds that drop down to the rainforest floor, either naked or embedded in fruit pulp, often disappear after a while. Many authors refer to this phenomenon as seed predation, implicitly assuming that the seed is destroyed by seedeaters such as rodents or ungulates (Forget et al. 1998). However, not all seed removal is by seedeaters. Many species of animals remove seeds while feeding on what is around seeds rather than on the seeds themselves. Terrestrial birds, mammals and reptiles ingest seeds while feeding on fallen fruit (e.g. Fragoso 1997, Erard & Sabatier 1988), tortoises ingest seeds while feeding on dung of frugivorous mammals (B. Josseaume unpublished data.), and dung beetles take and bury seeds with dung (Shephard & Chapman 1998, Andresen 1999, Feer 1999). All these animals may bring viable seeds into favourable conditions.

TI  - Mast seeding and predator-mediated indirect interactions in a forest community : evidence from post-dispersal fate of rodent-generated caches
PY  - 2002
AB  - When and how do seeds die? For most temperate trees the answer is soon after seed fall and as a result of seed predation. In temperate deciduous woodland a considerable proportion of seeds is consumed by granivores (Hulme, 1993, 1998; Hulme and Benkman, 2001). Not surprisingly, granivores (in particular, small mammals) have been found to play a pivotal role in the regeneration (Hulme, 1996b, 1997), colonization ability (Myster and Pickett, 1993), spatial distribution (Kollmann, 1995) and reproductive ecology (Sork, 1993) of temperate trees. To date, research on granivory in deciduous woodlands has tended to focus on the relative importance of habitat, microhabitat, plant species and seed density for seed predation rates (Willson and Whelan, 1990; Whelan et al., 1991; Myster and Pickett, 1993; Hulme and Borelli, 1999). However, the frequent absence of consistent directional trends (e.g. Willson and Whelan, 1990) has made it difficult to construct accurate predictive models of post-dispersal seed predation. One factor that might lead to inconsistencies in seed-predation rates may be the temporal and spatial variation in the abundance of alternative food resources. Polyphagous seed predators, such as small mammals, are likely to respond not only to the absolute abundance of a particular seed species but also to its relative abundance in relation to other seed species (Greenwood, 1985). For example, the rate of seed predation on a particular plant species can decrease dramatically following an increase in availability of a more preferred species. Such frequencydependent foraging by granivores has considerable potential to structure plant communities (Hulme, 1996a). Furthermore, frequency dependence may explain why inconsistent trends in removal rates are sometimes found among habitats, seasons and years (Schupp, 1990; Willson and Whelan, 1990; Kollmann et al., 1998). These inconsistencies may simply reflect spatial and/or temporal changes in the relative abundance of different seed species. Although several studies have examined seed predation in a community context (Schupp, 1990; Kollmann et al., 1998), only Hulme and Hunt (1999) have analysed how a seed

TI  - Reproductive Interdependence of Pinon Jays and Pinon Pines
PY  - 1978
AB  - Pinon Jays (Gymnorhinus cyanoephalus) and pinon pine trees (Pinus edulis) interact in a mutualistic fashion, in that the jays provide a primary means of seed dissemination for pinon trees in the Southwest, while at irregular intervals the trees provide the jays with an abundant and highly nutritious source of food. Availability of pinon seeds permits both late winter (February) and late summer (August) breeding by the jays. Seeds and photoperiod interact synergistically to accelerate gonadal development in late winter. When seeds are abundant, considerable testis growth takes place in some Pinon Jay ♂ ♂ even before the winter solstice. This relationship was investigated experimentally. Use of a specific food (pinon seeds) as a proximate timer for breeding, the ability of individual jays to breed in spring, molt, and breed again in August without an intervening period of gonadal refractoriness, and testicular development in early December, when day length approaches its minimum, are extraordinary characteristics among north—temperate—zone passerine birds. The synchrony of seed production by pinon pines over large geographic areas is interpreted as an evolved mechanism that (1) overwhelms invertebrate seed and cone predators, and (2) increases the numbers of seeds per tree that will be cached by Pinon Jays and other vertebrates. Caching sites of Pinon Jays are often at locations especially conducive to germination and growth of pinon pine seedlings.

TI  - Masting promotes individual- and population-level reproduction by increasing pollination efficiency
PY  - 2014
AB  - Masting is a reproductive strategy defined as the intermittent and synchronized production of large seed crops by a plant population. The pollination efficiency hypothesis proposes that masting increases pollination success in plants. Despite its general appeal, no previous studies have used long-term data together with population- and individual-level analyses to assess pollination efficiency between mast and non-mast events. Here we rigorously tested the pollination efficiency hypothesis in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a long-lived monoecious, wind-pollinated species, using a data set on 217 trees monitored annually for 20 years. Relative investment in male and female function by individual trees did not vary between mast and non-mast years. At both the population and individual level, the rate of production of mature female cones relative to male strobili production was higher in mast than non-mast years, consistent with the predicted benefit of reproductive synchrony on reproductive success. In addition, at the individual level we found a higher conversion of unfertilized female conelets into mature female cones during a mast year compared to a non- mast year. Collectively, parallel results at the population and individual tree level provide robust evidence for the ecological, and potentially also evolutionary, benefits of masting through increased pollination efficiency.

TI  - Whitebark pine stand condition, tree abundance, and cone production as predictors of visitation by Clark's nutcracker.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Background: Accurately quantifying key interactions between species is important for developing effective recovery strategies for threatened and endangered species. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act, depends on Clark’s nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) for seed dispersal. As whitebark pine succumbs to exotic disease and mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae), cone production declines, and nutcrackers visit stands less frequently, reducing the probability of seed dispersal. Methodology/Principal Findings: We quantified whitebark pine forest structure, health metrics, and the frequency of nutcracker occurrence in national parks within the Northern and Central Rocky Mountains in 2008 and 2009. Forest health characteristics varied between the two regions, with the northern region in overall poorer health. Using these data, we show that a previously published model consistently under-predicts the proportion of survey hours resulting in nutcracker observations at all cone density levels. We present a new statistical model of the relationship between whitebark pine cone production and the probability of Clark’s nutcracker occurrence based on combining data from this study and the previous study. Conclusions/Significance: Our model clarified earlier findings and suggested a lower cone production threshold value for predicting likely visitation by nutcrackers: Although nutcrackers do visit whitebark pine stands with few cones, the probability of visitation increases with increased cone production. We use information theoretics to show that beta regression is a more appropriate statistical framework for modeling the relationship between cone density and proportion of survey time resulting in nutcracker observations. We illustrate how resource managers may apply this model in the process of prioritizing areas for whitebark pine restoration.

TI  - Energy values of tree-seeds eaten by small mammals.
PY  - 1970
AB  - Caloric values were determined for 19 European tree-seeds (5 conifers and 14 deciduous), which constitute a potential food for mammals. With respect to weight these seeds may be divided into four groups: very light (birch, alders), light (larch, elm, pine, spruce, black locust, lime), heavy (hornbeam, fir, ash, maples, beech, stone pine), and very heavy (hazel and oaks). The nutritive content (seeds minus coats) varies from 24 to 85 % of the whole seed dry weight. There is no correlation between the seed size and nutritive content. The caloric value of whole seeds ranged from 4.4 to 6.8 kcal/g dry wt, with the highest values for conifers, beech and hazel (6.0-6.8), while the majority of deciduous seeds have a value of 5.0-5.3 kcal/g. The energy value of nutritive material exceeded that of the whole seeds and amounted to 4.4-7.9 kcal/g dry wt. Ash-free caloric values were higher by 1-7 %. Energy values of seeds are directly correlated with the lipid content. Most of these seeds are favorite foods of rodents (voles, mice, dormice, squirrels), although some of them are also eaten by shrews, as well as deer and wild boar.

TI  - Large-scale spatial synchrony and cross-synchrony in acorn production by two California oaks
PY  - 2013
AB  - Seed production that varies greatly from year to year, known as ''masting'' or ''mast-fruiting'' behavior, is a population-level phenomenon known to exhibit geographic synchrony extending, at least in some cases, hundreds of kilometers. The two main nonexclusive hypotheses for the driver of such geographically extensive synchrony are (1) environmental factors (the Moran effect), and (2) the mutual dependence of trees on outcrossed pollen (pollen coupling). We tested 10 predictions relevant to these two hypotheses using 18 years of acorn production data on two species of California oaks. Data were obtained across the entire ranges of the two species at 12 sites (10 for each species) separated by up to 745 km. In general, our results provided strong support for the importance of the Moran effect as a driver of spatial synchrony in and between these two species. Particularly compelling was evidence of close concordance between spatial synchrony in acorn production and key environmental factors extending over the range of both species and significant spatial cross-synchrony between the two species, despite considerable differences in their geographical ecology. Because oaks are monoecious, female flowers are not necessarily related to pollen production, and thus, our tests do not address the role of pollen coupling in bisexual species where pollen and flower production are necessarily correlated. For the oak species considered here, however, the Moran effect is a key driver of large-scale spatial synchrony in acorn production.

TI  - Is farther seed dispersal better? Spatial patterns of offspring mortality in three rainforest tree species with different dispersal abilities
PY  - 2007
AB  - The paradigm that tropical trees with farther seed dispersal experience lower offspring mortality is currently based on within-species studies documenting higher survival of offspring located farther from conspecific adults and/or closer to light gaps. We determined whether the paradigm also holds among species by comparing spatial patterns of offspring mortality among three sympatric Neotropical rainforest tree species with the same seed dispersers but with different dispersal abilities. First, we assessed spatially non-random mortality for each species by measuring spatial shifts of the population recruitment curve (PRC) with respect to conspecific adults and light gaps across three early life stages: dispersed seeds, young seedlings and old seedlings. Then, we determined whether PRC shifts were greater for the species with short dispersal distances than for the species with greater dispersal distances. We found that the PRC shifted away from conspecific adults consistently across life stages, but we found no consistent PRC shifts towards gaps, suggesting that mortality was related more to the proximity of conspecifics than to absence of light gaps. PRC shifts away from adults were greatest in the species with the lowest dispersal ability, supporting the paradigm. Differential PRC shifts caused the spatial distribution of offspring to become almost independent with respect to adult trees and gaps in all three species, despite large differences in seed dispersal distance among these species. Our results provide direct empirical support for the paradigm that among tropical trees, species with farther seed dispersal are less impacted by spatially non-random mortality than are similar species with shorter dispersal distances. Thus, greater dispersal effectiveness merits extra investments of trees in seed dispersal ability, even at the cost of fecundity.

TI  - Are all seeds equal? Spatially explicit comparisons of seed fall and sapling recruitment in a tropical forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 195-201 ABSTRACT: Understanding demographic transitions may provide the key to explain the high diversity of tropical tree communities. In a faunally intact Amazonian forest, we compared the spatial distribution of saplings of 15 common tree species with patterns of conspecific seed fall, and examined the seed-to-sapling transition in relation to locations of conspecific trees. In all species, the spatial pattern of sapling recruitment bore no resemblance to predicted distributions based on the density of seed fall. Seed efficiency (the probability of a seed producing a sapling) is strongly correlated with distance from large conspecific trees, with a > 30-fold multiplicative increase between recruitment zones that are most distant vs. proximal to conspecific adults. The striking decoupling of sapling recruitment and conspecific seed density patterns indicates near-complete recruitment failure in areas of high seed density located around reproductive adults. Our results provide strong support for the spatially explicit predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

TI  - Biological Flora of the British Isles: Fagus sylvatica
PY  - 2012
AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Fagus sylvatica L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - Seed scatterhoarding by white-tailed rats: consequences for seedling recruitment by an Australian rain forest tree
PY  - 2001
AB  - The role of white-tailed rats (Uromys caudimaculatus) as dispersers of seeds of the Australian tropical rain forest tree Beilschmiedia bancroftii, (Lauraceae) was investigated by following the fates of seeds and seedlings over 2 y. Fruits of this tree are too large to be consumed by any avian frugivore except the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), and the only other native mammal capable of dispersing the seeds is the musky rat kangaroo (Hypsiprimnodon moschatus). However, neither of these species has been documented to disperse the seeds of this tree. During a mast year, white-tailed rats cached seeds an average of 13 m from parent trees in a variety of microsites. Although none of the 61 cached seeds followed in this study survived to germination, comparison of seed, cache and seedling distributions suggested that most seedlings arose from rat-cached seeds. White-tailed rats cached seeds in both mast and non-mast years, but the time seeds remained on the forest floor and in caches was significantly shorter in non-mast years, suggesting that synchronous seed production increases the probability that some caches survive to germination. Because white-tailed rats are the most common and widespread native mammal capable of dispersing large-seeds, this study suggests that they may play an important role in the seed and seedling dynamics of large-seeded tree species in Australian tropical rain forests.

TI  - Seed Fate Pathways of Antelope Bitterbrush: Dispersal by Seed-Caching Yellow Pine Chipmunks
PY  - 1994
AB  - Seed fate pathways were investigated for antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tri- dentata), a common and economically important shrub, from fall 1988 to fall 1992 at the Whittell Forest and Wildlife Area in Little Valley, Washoe County, on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada in western Nevada. Rodents harvested bitterbrush seeds from late July to September, taking them either directly off the fruiting twigs or picking up fallen fruits from the ground surface and carrying from 63 to 80% of the seeds away intact from shrubs. Radioactively labelled bitterbrush seeds placed under four source shrubs were removed and scatter hoarded primarily by yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus). Caches con- tained a mean of 4-1 1 seeds and were located within 25 m from the source shrubs. Cache depth and microhabitat selection were generally favorable for bitterbrush seedling estab- lishment. Chipmunks and other rodents found many of the seed caches and either ate the seeds (53%) or recached them elsewhere. Chipmunks probably also carried some intact seeds to larders in hibernacula to use as a winter food source. In spring, >99% of emerging seedlings occurred in clumps containing from 2 to 104 individuals. An estimated 5.3 and 8.5% of those seeds cached by rodents and 1.1 and 2.4% of the seeds produced by shrubs in 1990 and 1991 produced emergent seedlings the following spring. Seedling mortality rates during their 1st yr ranged from 78 to 92%. Grazing by rodents was the most important source of mortality during early spring, and most seedling deaths were caused by desiccation during summer. Despite considerable attrition of individuals within clumps, most mature "shrubs" consisted of two or more individuals. The seed fate pathway that resulted in the highest probability of seedling establishment at this study site was harvest, dispersal, and scatter hoarding by chipmunks, and subsequent neglect of those caches. Retrieval of cached seeds by chipmunks followed by redistribution of those seeds to neglected secondary caches also resulted in many seedlings. Modes of seed dispersal based solely on abiotic agents appear to be insufficient to account for sig- nificant recruitment of bitterbrush seedlings.

TI  - Strict mast fruiting for a tropical dipterocarp tree: a demographic cost–benefit analysis of delayed reproduction and seed predation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Masting, the production of large seed crops at intervals of several years, is a reproductive adaptation displayed by many tree species. The predator satiation hypothesis predicts that starvation of seed predators between mast years and satiation during mast years decreases seed predation and thus enhances tree regeneration. 2. Mast fruiting comes at demographic costs such as missed reproduction opportunities and increased density-dependence of recruits, but it remains unknown if predator satiation constitutes a sufficiently large benefit for masting to evolve as a viable life-history strategy. So far, no studies have quantified the net fitness consequences of masting. 3. Using a long-term demographic data set of the dipterocarp Shorea leprosula in a Malaysian forest, we constructed stochastic matrix population models and performed a demographic cost–benefit analysis. 4. For observed values of mast frequency and seed predation rates, we show that strict masting strongly increases fitness compared with fruiting annually. Model results also show that the demographic costs of mast fruiting are very low compared to the demographic losses due to seed predation in a scenario of annual fruiting. Finally, we find that mast fruiting would still be selected for even at low levels of seed predation and when including additional costs such as decreased adult growth rates, limiting crop size and density-dependent seedling survival. 5. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the predator satiation hypothesis: mast fruiting increases fitness for a range of seed predation levels. Under seed predation pressure annually fruiting species are at a strong disadvantage and as a result a mast fruiting strategy may swiftly confer a fitness advantage. Our study shows that demographic modelling allows the weighing of fitness benefits and costs of life-history phenomena such as strict masting.

TI  - The choice of seed tracking method influenced fate of beech seeds dispersed by rodents
PY  - 2013
AB  - We tracked seeds of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) dispersed by rodents in Gorzowska Forest (western Poland). We used two seed labeling methods, marking with UV-fluorescent powder and with plastic tags, to test whether using different marking methods influences results of seed tracking. The removal rates did not differ among seeds marked with UV-powder, seeds labeled with tags, and unmanipulated seeds. We found 78 % of removed seeds marked with tags, but only 25 % of UV-marked seeds. The consumption rates of tagged and UV-marked seeds were dramatically different: rodents ate 83 % of the former and 26 % of the later. The average dispersal distance was larger for seeds marked with UV-powder than for tagged seeds. Our findings suggest that the choice of seed tracking method might influence results of seed dispersal studies.

TI  - Reproductive success of individuals with different fruit production patterns. What does it mean for the predator satiation hypothesis
PY  - 2012
AB  - The predator satiation hypothesis states that synchronous periodic production of seeds is an adaptive strategy evolved to reduce the pressure of seed predators. The seed production pattern is crucial to the predator satiation hypothesis, but there are few studies documenting the success of individuals that are in synchrony and out of synchrony with the whole population. This study is based on long-term data on seed production of Sorbus aucuparia and specialised pre-dispersal seed predation by Argyresthia conjugella, in a subalpine spruce forest in the Western Carpathians (Poland). At the population level, we tested whether functional and numerical responses of predators to the variation of fruit production operate. At the individual level, we tested whether individuals with higher interannual variability in their own seed crops and higher synchrony with the population have higher percentages of uninfested fruits. The intensity of pre-dispersal seed predation was high (average 70 %; range 19–100 %). There were both functional and numerical responses of predators to the variation of fruit production at the population level. We found that individuals that were expected to be preferred under seed predator pressure had higher reproductive success. With increasing synchrony of fruit production between individual trees and the population, the percentage of infested fruits decreased. There was also a negative relationship between the interannual variation in individual fruit production and the percentage of infested fruits. These results confirm selection for individuals with a masting strategy. However, the population does not seem well adapted to strong seed predation pressure and we suggest that this may be a result of prolonged diapause of A. conjugella.

TI  - Coadaptations of the Clark's nutcracker and the pinon pine for efficient seed harvest and dispersal.
PY  - 1977
AB  - Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) is one of four species of corvids that commences harvesting, transporting, and caching the seeds of pinon pine (Pinus edulis) in mid—August. Caching continues until inclement weather intervenes or the seed crop is depleted. Nutcrackers are efficient at collecting seeds from the trees because the birds discriminate edible and aborted seeds, select cones with higher than average number of good seeds and appear to concentrate on those trees that produce cones with large numbers of good seeds. The use of a sublingual pouch allows the nutcracker to carry up to 95 pinon pine seeds per trip (x = 55). A pouch full of seeds may be carried as far as 22 km from the collecting area (the pinon—juniper woodland, elevation ~ 1800 m) to communal caching areas where the seeds are buried in clumps in subterranean caches at a depth of 2 to 3 cm. These caching areas are on steep, south—facing slopes that are usually free of snow by late winter. Although solitary nesters, the birds, during the nonbreeding season, often form flocks when harvesting seeds. A flock of 150 nutcrackers cached between 3.3—5.0 X 106 pinon pine seeds in the autumn of a good cone crop. Each bird caches between 2.2 and 3.3 X its needed energetic requirements for the insect—free portion of the year. Some of the unrecovered seeds germinated and grew. The pinon pine reaches its highest density in relatively dry areas below the elevational range of other members of the genus Pinus, but ranges up to 3,100 m into the mixed coniferous forest. This pine has developed a number of traits that enhance its efficiency to be located and dispersed by the birds. The seeds are unusually large, of high energy value, and have relatively thin seed coats. The large size improves the germination potential of the seed but also attracts predators and dispersal agents. The seed coat color is markedly different for edible and aborted seeds, thus labeling them for visually oriented seed harvesters. Most pinon pine cones are oriented outward and upward which increases illumination of the seeds and tends to hold them in the cone. The pinon pine displays the seeds in its cones more readily than wind—dispersed pines by opening the seed—bearing cone scales to a uniform angle. Pinon pine seeds are retained for a long period of time in the cone because they are held in deep depressions on the cone scales by small flanges. This constellation of features indicated an evolutionary strategy on the part of the pinon pine to exploit and encourage members of the seed—caching guild to disperse the seeds. Deposition sites are presumably more favorable for germination than those obtained by simply broadcasting the seeds over a wide area. Individual seedlings potentially experience immediate intraspecific competition because the seeds are cached in clumps. Only one seedling, presumably the strongest, fastest—growing individual, survives. The benefits of this system to the nutcracker are that the bird has a supply of energy for the most unproductive months of the year. The bird also breeds in late winter or early spring, using the stored seeds for reproductive energy.

TI  - The functional response of a hoarding seed predator to mast seeding
PY  - 2010
AB  - Mast seeding involves the episodic and synchronous production of large seed crops by perennial plants. The predator satiation hypothesis proposes that mast seeding maximizes seed escape because seed predators consume a decreasing proportion of available seeds with increasing seed production. However, the seed escape benefits of masting depend not only on whether predators are satiated at high levels of seed production, but also on the shape of their functional response (type II vs. type III), and the actual proportion of available seeds that they consume at different levels of seed production. North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are the primary vertebrate predator of white spruce (Picea glauca) mast seed crops in many boreal regions because they hoard unopened cones in underground locations, preempting the normal sequence of cone opening, seed dispersal, and seed germination. We document the functional response of cone-hoarding by red squirrels across three non-mast years and one mast year by estimating the number of cones present in the territories of individual red squirrels and the proportion of these cones that they hoarded each autumn. Even though red squirrels are not constrained by the ingestive and on-body (fat reserves) energy reserve limitations experienced by animals that consume seeds directly, most squirrels hoarded < 10% of the cones present on their territories under mast conditions. Cone availability during non-mast years also reached levels that satiated the hoarding activity of red squirrels; however, this occurred only on the highest-quality territories. Squirrels switched to mushroom-hoarding when cone production was low and mushrooms were abundant. This resulted in type III functional response whereby the proportional harvest of cones was highest at levels of cone availability that were intermediate within non-mast years. Overall, more cones escaped squirrel cone-hoarding during a mast event than when cone production was low in non-mast years, which supports the predator satiation hypothesis. However, the highly variable seed escape in non-mast years may help to explain why all spruce cone production is not concentrated into fewer, larger, mast years.

TI  - Sex allocation, pollen limitation and masting in whitebark pine
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Masting, the synchronous and episodic production of seed crops, is thought to benefit plant reproductive success through positive density-dependent effects on pollination, dispersal and seed survival. Of these, only increased pollination efficiency in mast years can be a proximate mechanism for masting by synchronizing reproductive effort across individuals through pollen coupling. 2. Increased pollination efficiency requires synchronous investment in male and female function during mast years. Sex allocation theory, however, predicts a trade-off in investment between male and female reproductive allocation dependent on total resources invested in reproduction. 3. We describe patterns of sex allocation in Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine), using data on pollen and seed cone counts over 5 years for 29 trees across 7 sites in Montana, U.S.A. 4. Whitebark pine seed cone maturation increased with site pollen cone production, indicating pollen limitation, and pollen and seed cone production were positively correlated across years. 5. Simulating mature seed cone production from these empirical relationships resulted in greater average mature seed cone production than alternative scenarios of (i) no synchrony between pollen cone production and pollen cone initiation, (ii) negative correlation (trade-off) between seed cone initiation and pollen cone production or (iii) no masting. 6. Synthesis. Our data support a role for pollination efficiency in both increasing long-term seed production and as a proximate mechanism for synchronizing masting in Pinus albicaulis. Increased pollination efficiency joins greater seed dispersal and survival in mast years seen in other studies, as an additional positive density-dependent benefit of masting. Positive density-dependent fitness benefits may therefore influence patterns of sex allocation in relation to total resources invested in reproduction. The pollen limitation found here combined with stand isolation and reduced tree density due to mortality from forest pests and other environmental stressors may lead to reduced seed cone maturation and changes in masting patterns.

TI  - Cues versus proximate drivers: testing the mechanism behind masting behavior
PY  - 2013
AB  - Masting, the intermittent and synchronized production of seeds, is a common and important phenomenon throughout the plant kingdom. Surprisingly, the proximate mechanisms by which populations of masting plants synchronize their seed sets have been relatively unexplored. We examined how temperature influences the acorn crop of the valley oak Quercus lobata, a masting species common in California, USA, over 33 years in order to assess whether temperature acts directly on acorn crop as a cue or whether it acts instead through intermediate steps indicative of a direct mechanistic connection to acorn production. Compared to several alternatives, the difference in temperature during the spring flowering period over the prior two years (Δt) was a good predictor of annual acorn crop in valley oak, as proposed recently by Kelly et al. Significantly, Δt correlates positively with temperatures the previous April, a likely driver of pollination success in valley oak, and negatively with the previous year's acorn crop, which is in turn negatively correlated with the current year's acorn crop, presumably due to resource limitation. Thus, the success of Δt is not as a cue but rather explained by its close relationship to the proximate drivers that have a direct, mechanistic relationship with acorn crop size.

TI  - Flowering in snow tussock (Chionochloa spp.) is influenced by temperature and hormonal cues
PY  - 2012
AB  - Snow tussocks (Chionochloa spp.) in New Zealand exhibit extreme mast (episodic) seeding which has important implications for plant ecology and plant–insect interactions. Heavy flowering appears to be triggered by very warm/dry summers in the preceding year. In order to investigate the physiological basis for mast flowering, mature snow tussock plants in the field and younger plants in a glasshouse and shadehouse were subjected to a range of manipulative treatments. Field treatments included combinations of warming, root pruning and applications of two native gibberellins (GAs) GA3, which is known to be highly floral inductive and GA4, which is associated with continued floral apex development in another long-day grass. Warming, GA3 alone and especially warming + GA3, significantly promoted flowering, as did applications of GA4 alone and GA4 + CCC (2-chloroethyltrimethylammonium chloride, which is a known synergist of GA3-induced flowering in the annual grass, Lolium temulentum L.). Our results provide support for the concept that mast flowering events in tussock species are causally related to high temperature-induced increases in endogenous gibberellin levels. It is likely that GAs (endogenous or applied) promote the continued development of a previously long-day induced floral apex. In addition to the promotion of flowering, applied GA3 also disturbed the plant’s innate resource threshold requirements, as shown by the death, over winter, of many non-flowering tillers. Applied GA4 did not show this effect, likely due to its rapid catabolic metabolism to an inactive form. High temperature-induced flowering mediated by elevated levels of endogenous floral-promotive GAs could have important implications for regulating the evolutionary interaction between these masting plants and their seed predators.

TI  - Both seedling banks and specialist seed predators promote the evolution of synchronized and intermittent reproduction (masting) in trees
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary


1. Conditions leading to the evolution of masting (intermittent and synchronized reproduction of trees) are examined. According to the dynamics of the resource reserve of individuals, reproductive investment is the proportion of investment in flowers with coefficient k. If k evolves to sufficiently large values, trees show a large between-year fluctuation in the seed crop even in a constant environment (masting).



2. Our assumptions are: the forest consists of many sites, each occupied by a single canopy tree. After a canopy tree falls, the vacant site (gap) becomes available for recruitment.



3. Masting never evolves if all vacant sites are filled by individuals from seeds produced in the same year, despite the fact that trees reproducing intermittently enjoy a higher pollination success than trees reproducing annually.



4. Masting can evolve if some seedlings survive for several years, forming a seedling bank on the forest floor, where seeds produced in different years compete for gap acquisition. In this case, the disadvantage of intermittent reproduction is compensated for by seedlings and the benefit of pollen limitation dominates.



5. We also study the effect of specialist seed predators. In the complete absence of seed bank or seeding bank, masting never evolves even in the presence of seed predators. If some seedlings survive for multiple years, seed predators can promote the evolution of masting.



6. Synthesis. Both seedling banks and specialist seed predators promote the evolution of masting. However, the presence of seed predators can work only when some seedlings can survive more than 1 year. The regeneration process of forests must be considered when the evolution of the reproduction of plants is discussed.

TI  - Experimental evidence for an intraspecific Janzen-Connell effect mediated by soil biota
PY  - 2015
AB  - The negative effect of soil pathogens on seedling survival varies considerably among conspecific individuals, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. For variation between heterospecifics, a common explanation is the Janzen-Connell effect: negative density dependence in survival due to specialized pathogens aggregating on common hosts. We test whether an intraspecific Janzen-Connell effect exists, i.e., whether the survival chances of one population's seedlings surrounded by a different conspecific population increase with genetic difference, spatial distance, and trait dissimilarity between them. In a shade-house experiment, we grew seedlings of five populations of each of two subtropical tree species (Castanopsis fissa and Canarium album) for which we measured genetic distance using intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis and eight common traits/characters, and we treated them with soil material or soil biota filtrate collected from different populations. We found that the relative survival rate increased with increasing dissimilarity measured by spatial distance, genetic distance, and trait differences between the seedling and the population around which the soil was collected. This effect disappeared after soil sterilization. Our results provide evidence that genetic variation, trait similarity, and spatial distance can explain intraspecific variation in plant-soil biotic interactions and suggest that limiting similarity also occurs at the intraspecific level.

TI  - Forest rodents provide directed dispersal of Jeffrey pine seeds
PY  - 2009
AB  - Some species of animals provide directed dispersal of plant seeds by transporting them nonrandomly to microsites where their chances of producing healthy seedlings are enhanced. We investigated whether this mutualistic interaction occurs between granivorous rodents and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) in the eastern Sierra Nevada by comparing the effectiveness of random abiotic seed dispersal with the dispersal performed by four species of rodents: deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), yellow-pine and long-eared chipmunks (Tamias amoenus and T. quadrimaculatus), and golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis). We conducted two caching studies using radio-labeled seeds, the first with individual animals in field enclosures and the second with a community of rodents in open forest. We used artificial caches to compare the fates of seeds placed at the range of microsites and depths used by animals with the fates of seeds dispersed abiotically. Finally, we examined the distribution and survival of naturally establishing seedlings over an eight-year period. Several lines of evidence suggested that this community of rodents provided directed dispersal. Animals preferred to cache seeds in microsites that were favorable for emergence or survival of seedlings and avoided caching in microsites in which seedlings fared worst. Seeds buried at depths typical of animal caches (5-25 mm) produced at least five times more seedlings than did seeds on the forest floor. The four species of rodents differed in the quality of dispersal they provided. Small, shallow caches made by deer mice most resembled seeds dispersed by abiotic processes, whereas many of the large caches made by ground squirrels were buried too deeply for successful emergence of seedlings. Chipmunks made the greatest number of caches within the range of depths and microsites favorable for establishment of pine seedlings. Directed dispersal is an important element of the population dynamics of Jeffrey pine, a dominant tree species in the eastern Sierra Nevada. Quantifying the occurrence and dynamics of directed dispersal in this and other cases will contribute to better understanding of mutualistic coevolution of plants and animals and to more effective management of ecosystems in which directed dispersal is a keystone process.

TI  - A Model for Seed Scatterhoarding: Coevolution of Fox Squirrels and Black Walnuts
PY  - 1978
AB  - Granivores are likely to store food in numerous, widely scattered, small caches if they are unable to defend concentrated large caches against interspecific competitors. This scatterhoarding of seeds makes it impossible for individuals to defend all their scattered caches against intraspecific competitors as well. Optimal spacing of scattered caches should result from a balance between decreasing loss of caches to naive competitors with decreasing density and increasing cost of storage with decreasing density. A mathematical model predicting optimal density is presented. One prediction of the model is that as the (θ) of habitat suitable for seed burial surrounding a seed source is decreased, the average distance (D) a cache is taken from the source by scatterhoarders should increase. Another prediction is that increasing the number of seeds (N) at a source, either by an increase in the size of a single seed crop or by the presence of 2 or more conspecific seed producers in close proximity to one another, should increase D. One trait of trees which increases single crop sizes and average seed dispersal distance (D) is the pattern of withholding energy from reproduction some years to allow unusually large crops during mast years. Three field tests of the model and its predictions were conducted: (1) Juglans nigra seeds were buried at 3 densities and their survival in time from predation by Sciurus niger was found to increase with decreasing density; (2) average distances that J. nigra saplings occurred from 16 parent walnut trees were found to have a statistically significant correlation with the D calculated from the model and the θ of suitable habitat surrounding each tree; (3) Sciurus niger individuals were observed to scatterhoard Juglans nigra seeds in a pattern that maintained a mean cache density that gives low rates of loss to naive competitors as indicated from field test (1). The results strongly suggest maintenance of optimum cache density by S. niger. The coevolution of trees which have mast years and the animals that scatterhoard their seeds is discussed.

TI  - Synchronicity, periodicity and bimodality in inter-annual tree seed production along an elevation gradient
PY  - 2011
AB  - Distinctive inter-annual patterns of tree seed production can include spatial synchronicity, periodicity, and high variability among individuals within a population. Synchronicity and high variability are now commonly used to define mast seeding, with ‘strict’ mast seeding further distinguished by annual seed production that is either often large or nil and thus bimodal. Here we test for synchronicity, periodicity, and bimodality using 43 years of annual total and viable seed counts, along four transect lines, sampling an elevation gradient (480–1340 m) in a monospecific New Zealand mountain beech Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides forest. We expect most support for periodicity and bimodality at relatively high elevation sites that are most resource limited and known to have the greatest variability in seed production. While there was weak evidence for differences in viable seed counts along the elevation gradient, this was not the case for total seed counts. A significant yeareffect on seed counts provided some evidence for synchronization, but the correlations of total or viable seed counts rapidly declined (from 0.96 to 0.58) with increasing elevation difference among transect lines. Although we detected a seven-year periodicity in total and viable seed counts at each elevation, we also detected other period lengths at most elevations. We did not find evidence for our expectation of increased period length and bimodality in relatively unproductive high elevation mountain beech forests because they would take more time to recover from seeding events. As a consequence, if resource limitation is an important driver of mountain beech seed production its influence must be strongly regulated by other factors to determine the distinctive characteristics (periodicity and synchronicity but not bimodality) of inter-annual variation in seed production.

TI  - Food Hoarding in Animals
PY  - 1990
AB  - In this first comprehensive synthesis of the literature on food hoarding in animals, Stephen B. Vander Wall discusses how animals store food, how they use food and how this use affects individual fitness, why and how food hoarding evolved, how cached food is lost, mechanisms for protecting and recovering cached food, physiological and behavioral factors that influence hoarding, and the impact that hoarding animals have on plant populations and plant dispersal. He then provides detailed coverage of hoarding behavior across taxa-mammals, birds, and arthropods-to address issues in evolution, ecology, and behavior. Drawings, photographs, and appendixes document complex and intrinsically interesting food-hoarding behaviors, and the bibliography of nearly 1,500 sources is itself an invaluable and unique reference.

TI  - Recaching of Jeffrey pine (<i>Pinus</i> <i>jeffreyi</i>) seeds by yellow pine chipmunks (<i>Tamias</i> <i>amoenus</i>): potential effects on plant reproductive success
PY  - 1998
AB  - <jats:p> Animals that scatter-hoard seeds frequently dig up and recache them at new locations. The effect of the recaching of seeds on plant reproductive success was studied in the Sierra Nevada of western Nevada. The fate of 1000 individually marked Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) seeds initially placed in 100 primary caches in a 10 x 10 array was monitored during autumn 1995 and spring 1996. Yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) quickly removed nearly all of the seeds and recached many of them in 377 secondary caches containing 727 seeds. Later, rodents dug up most of these caches and transferred them to 213 tertiary caches (283 seeds), 75 quaternary caches (92 seeds), and 13 quintic (fifth order) caches (13 seeds). Overall, rodents ate 15.3% of the seeds they took from primary through quintic caches, and an additional 71.1% of the seeds disappeared, probably to underground runways and larders. During our spring survey of the study site, 133 seeds (13.6%) from 84 caches had germinated or were about to germinate. As rodents moved seeds from cache site to cache site, several changes occurred that potentially influenced the distribution and survival of Jeffrey pine seedlings. First, the number of seeds per cache decreased. Second, cached seeds were gradually moved farther from the source area. Third, the dispersal distance between successive cache sites decreased. Fourth, the distribution of cached seeds became more even. Lastly, more seeds were cached beneath shrubs, which serve as nurse plants for Jeffrey pine seedlings. Consequently, the movement of seeds between cache sites by chipmunks may increase the probability that Jeffrey pine seedlings will establish from rodent caches. </jats:p>

TI  - Ignorant seed predators and factors affecting the seed survival of a tropical palm
PY  - 2001
AB  - In addition to acting as seed predators, some terrestrial mammals bury seeds via scatter hoarding. This study system used two permanent plots in examining the interaction between small rodents and the seeds of the palm Astrocaryum mexicanum. We tested how experimental burial, and fruiting status of the parent, distance to the parent, seed size, and microsite characteristics affect the survival of these seeds. Up to 34% of the buried seeds that were exposed only to ignorant rodent foragers (individuals not responsible for burial) survived. In comparison, less than 1% of seeds buried by scatter hoarding rodents survived in previous studies, a percentage that is comparable to the low survival of unburied seeds in this study (<2%). Although unburied seeds had very low survival, increasing distance and/or seed density positively affected survival of unburied seeds. Distance to parent had no effect on buried seed survival. Buried seed survival was most strongly and significantly determined by the fruiting status of the trees under which they occurred. Seeds experienced significantly greater predation if buried under “parent” trees that fruited during the experiment. Buried seed survival was also negatively affected by germination, as germination may signal the presence of a seed to foraging rodents. There was some indication of a positive effect of tree density on seed survival between the two plots, whereas differences in rodent abundance appear to have no effect on seed survival. Seed size and microsite characteristics had no significant effect on buried seed survival, likely due to the greater proportional effects of other factors and the longevity of A. mexicanum seeds. The results of this study were used to generate a hypothetical causal network showing how comparatively low recovery of buried seeds by ignorant foragers – combined with processes determining the removal of scatter hoarding foragers from their scattered seed caches – may affect seedling recruitment in A. mexicanum.

TI  - Distribution of palm fruits on a rain forest floor: Why white-lipped peccaries forage near objects.
PY  - 1981
AB  - Litter and soil disturbance in the wake of white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) herds in southeastern Peru indicates that these animals often forage intensively at the bases of "objects" such as trees, exposed roots, logs, and lianas. I sampled the litter and soil near such objects on the forest floor, and found that fruits of the common palm trees were encountered more frequently near objects than in the open. This pattern was especially well marked for seeds of an Astrocaryum palm having a very restricted fruiting season. Where white-lippeds had recently foraged, densities of some fruit types were significantly reduced near objects. Apparently the peccaries are consuming palm fruits that have been scatterhoarded by rodents. WHITE-LIPPED PECCARIES (Tayassu pecari) occur in larger groups than any other terrestrial mammal in neotropical rain forests. Their herds, which may contain over 100 individuals, leave broad areas of overturned litter and disturbed soil wherever they have foraged. During a study of "white-lippeds" in southeastern Peru, I invariably noted that soil and litter disturbance in the wakes of herds was concentrated near certain objects-at the' bases of plant stems, along logs and exposed roots, and beneath lianas and low shrubs with dense foliage. One possible explanation for this observation was that the white-lippeds were searching for invertebrates in such places, as Ewer (1970) suggested to explain similar habits of the African forest hog Hylochoerus meinertzhageni. However, the extent of the disturbance seemed disproportionate to the small amounts of invertebrate body parts found in white-lipped stomachs (Kiltie 1980). Another possibility was that the peccaries were searching for fruits with hard endocarp at these places, since stomach contents, feeding experiments with captive animals, and anatomical evidence (Kiltie 1980) indicated that white-lippeds are distinguished by their ability to masticate very hard fruits and seeds. This explanation was further suggested by the fact that elsewhere in the neotropics, agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) and squirrels (Sciurus granatensis) have been observed scatterhoarding fruits along tree bases, logs, roots, and beneath lianas (Smythe 1978: 26; Heaney and Thorington 1978; Morris 1962). Thus it was conceivable that white-lippeds were exploiting hard fruits that had been stored by rodents. The study described in this report was designed to see if palm fruits were more abundant near objects than elsewhere on the forest floor and to see if whitelipped peccaries were harvesting such fruits.

TI  - Seed-dispersal of Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) by caviomorph rodents in French Guiana
PY  - 1990
AB  - A possible mutualistic dispersal system between a large-seeded tree of French Guiana, Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae), and caviomorph rodents, Myoprocta exilis and Dasyprocta leporina, is described. Mast fruiting of Vouacapoua at the beginning of the wet season coincides with scatter-hoarding seed dispersal. During the wet season, almost 100% of marked seeds on three sites were removed: nearly 70% were buried and the rest were eaten by mammals. Unburied seeds were attacked by insects and/or lost their ability to germinate. Rodents preferred ungerminated seeds, and had no interest in germinated seeds. Seeds were buried individually near natural objects such as palms, branches, logs, lianas, roots and trees. After predation by rodents, seedling distribution did not differ from seed distribution. Most seeds were transported less than 5 m from the feeding plots but some were carried as far as 22.4 m. Between 40 and 85% of dispersed seeds were retrieved during the following month by rodents and eaten. The disinterest of caviomorph rodents in germinated seeds, because of rapid exhaustion of endosperm reserves, prevents feeding from hoarded Vouacapoua during the long dry season when resources are scarce. Seedlings emerging from forgotten or abandoned cached seeds appear to increase the recruitment of Vouacapoua americana.

CONCEPTUAL CHANGE: A SECOND FORM OF EVOLUTION Knowing everything there is to know about how concepts or ideas can get represented in the mind of an individual would not take us far toward an account of why individuals understand the world the way they do, or explain why their understanding differs from that of their ancestors. While some ideas fade into obscurity, others rise to prominence and spread horizontally through society, and vertically from one generation to another, getting progressively refined and embellished along the way. Ideas, like the strands of DNA that encode instructions for building and maintaining living organisms, seem to undergo a process analogous to biological evolution. Understanding this process is a vital part of unraveling our cognitive make-up. There has been a slow but steady effort to map the concept of evolution onto the dynamics of culture. Popper (1963) and Campbell (1987) alerted us to the evolutionary flavor of epistemology. Dawkins (1976) introduced the notion of a meme--a replicator of cultural information analogous to the gene. In his words: "Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperm or eggs, so do memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain." Others have drawn from mathematical models of population genetics and epidemiology to model the spread of ideas (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981; Lumsden & Wilson 1981; Schuster & Sigmund 1983; Boyd & Richerson 1985; Hofbauer & Sigmund 1988). These works point toward the possibility that memetics constitutes a second form of evolution, distinct from yet intertwined with biological evolution, with the potential to provide the kind of overarching framework for the social and cognitive sciences that the first form provides for the biological sciences. However thus far memetics has not lived up to this potential, a situation that seems unfortunate given the success of the biological precedent. Although much was known about living things before Darwin, his theory of how life evolves through natural selection united previously disparate phenomena and paved the way for further biological inquiry.

TI  - A model of caching depth: implications for scatter hoarders and plant dispersal.
PY  - 1993
AB  - The ability of foragers to detect stored seeds and nuts is known to decrease with increasing depth at which scatter hoarders bury these food items. Depth of burial of seeds and nuts is known to influence the ability of seedlings to emerge and establish if seeds are not discovered by foragers. These two patterns are combined in a model of caching depth, and implications of the model for food hoarders and plant propagules are explored. Optimal caching depth for hoarders is the depth where the probable recoverable energy in a cache discounted by the energy to make and retrieve a cache is greatest. Optimal burial depth for a propagule is where the probability of it escaping detection by a forager times the probability that it will germinate, emerge, and survive in the absence of predation is maximized. Certain aspects of the cache depth model were tested for yellow pine chipmunks caching the seed of antelope bitterbrush in field and laboratory experiments. The depths yielding the greatest probability of establishment of bitterbrush seedlings was 10-30 mm, with seeds buried 20 mm deep having the greatest success. Yellow pine chipmunks, the primary dispersal agent of bitterbrush seeds in this Sierra Nevada study area, cached most seeds between 5 and 20 mm deep, in the upper portion of the range yielding the greatest bitterbrush establishment. The partial agreement between chipmunk caching behavior and bitterbrush requirements may be largely fortuitous, but certain evolutionary adjustments by the plants may result in a closer match between seedling requirements and the behavior of seed-caching animals.

TI  - A Day in the Life of a Seed: Movements and Fates of Seeds and Their Implications for Natural and Managed Systems
PY  - 1994
AB  - We develop a model that outlines the movements and fates of seeds after they leave the parent plant, and then we examine the relative influences of abiotic and biotic factors on those movements and fates. Phase I dispersal is movement of a seed from the parent to a surface, while Phase II dispersal includes subsequent horizontal or vertical movements. Although less studied, Phase II dispersal is more likely to account for the patterning of plants in communities and ecosystems and is the focus of this review. Abiotic factors influence Phase II dispersal-the distance and type of movement depend on seed morphology, surface attributes, and the nature of the physical forces. Biotic factors (animals) move seeds to new sites passively either on body surfaces or by ingestion, or actively by consuming fruits or hoarding seeds. Animals also influence the movements of seeds through digging and burrowing activities. Arrival at microsites suitable for germination and establishment is critical and is affected not only by abiotic and biotic factors but also by seed morphology and ger- mination responses. We emphasize that seed banks are much more dynamic than they are usually portrayed. Although often poorly quantified, seed mor-

TI  - Predation and dispersal of large and small seeds of a tropical palm
PY  - 2001
AB  - Seed size may vary greatly among individuals within plant species. What effects the extremes of this variation have for seeds taken by small mammals are poorly understood. Not all seeds removed by small mammals are necessarily eaten. Small rodents are common seed predators, but they may disperse a significant proportion of seeds by scatter hoarding them via burial. Size-dependent predation and dispersal of seeds has not been directly tested within a plant species for tropical rodents. This study tested whether or not large and small nuts of Astrocaryum mexicanum (Palmae) differed in their fates due to handling by the spiny pocket mouse Heteromys desmarestianus (Heteromyidae). Exclosures were used to give small rodents exclusive access to A. mexicanum nuts. H. desmarestianus preferentially consumed large over small A. mexicanum nuts, but cached (in burrows and by scatter hoarding) similar proportions of these nuts by size. Small nuts tended to be buried farther away from exclosures than large nuts. Although sample sizes of buried nuts were small, the rodents retrieved all buried large nuts, but 30% of the small nuts remained buried long enough to germinate. I also examined predispersal predation by insects and found that insects appear to have no size preference for A. mexicanum nuts, but insect predation appears to hinder nut development. Thus, nuts attacked by insects develop to be significantly smaller, with a low proportion of undamaged endosperm, than uninfested nuts. It is hypothesized that the preferential predation of large A. mexicanum nuts by H. desmarestianus is a response by these rodents to insect predation.

TI  - Effects of desiccation on the recalcitrant seeds of Carapa guianensis Aubl. and Carapa procera DC
PY  - 1998
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine if the seeds of Cczrapa guianensis Aubl. and Carapa proceru DC. undergo physio logica l, biochemica l, and u ltrastructura l changes when they are desiccated; and to find if these changes can be used to monitor viabi lity in Carapa. Seeds were air-dried at room temperature for 7-l 1 days. Samp les were taken at frequent interva ls and germination was tested, moisture determined, lipids extracted, and samp les taken for e l ectron microscopy. The moisture content (MC) of the embryonic axes remained high throughout the experiment. The coty l edons were drier and had a higher MC variation between individua l seeds during desiccation. Whi l e Kar l Fisher moisture ana lyses indicated no re lationship between axis MC and seed viabi lity, differentia l scanning ca lorimetry (DSC) thermograms showed a strong re lationship between the me lting endotherm peak onset va lues, entha lpy (heat content) and seed germinabi lity. Both techniques were ineffective in determining changes in seed viabi lity when viabi lity remained above 50%. Ana lyses of the bu l k lipids indicated that changes were taking p lace, but gas chromatography (GC) resu lts were inconsistent from year to year. E l ectron microscopy (EM) examinations found that ce ll u lar contents of Curapa showed litt l e organization when seeds were fresh, but that spherosomes accumu lated as desiccation progressed. These data and those from the moisture, DSC and GC ana lyses, add support to the hypothesis that storage prob l ems of reca lcitrant seeds are associated with intact seed MC and with lipid composition, metabo lism, and distribution in the ce ll s.

TI  - Density-Dependent Survival of Scatterhoarded Nuts: An Experimental Appoach
PY  - 1984
AB  - We tested our earlier prediction that the food content of buried nuts will influence the density at which fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) scatterhoard each species of nut. We buried black walnuts (Juglans nigra), bur oak acorns (Quercus macrocarpa), and chinquapin oak acorns (Q. muehlenbergii) at varying densities in monospecific and mixed-species grids in three different years and three different seasons within a year, and analyzed their survival from predation over time. We also observed free- ranging squirrels scatterhoard walnuts and bur oak acorns, which we made available in equal numbers. The survival of buried nuts was dependent on the nut species, nut density, and squirrel density. The lowest meaningful density of buried nuts for squirrels was related to the food content of the nut species. Analysis of nut survival at the same burial sites in successive seasons indicated that squirrels did not use memory to return to specific sites where they had previously found nuts. Rather, they foraged preferentially in certain microhabitats. Squirrels were observed burying black walnuts farther away from a source pile than they buried bur oak acorns. The difference is consistent with the difference in food content between the two species and also with the threshhold density below which naive squirrels have no density-dependent effect on buried nuts. Our data on nut survival suggest that squirrel foraging varies with nut density but not with nut spacing.

PY  - 2002
AB  - In the Amazon Basin occur both species of the genus Carapa (Meliaceae). Roba-mahogany is well known for the quality of its timber and the oil extracted from its seeds. The provision of basic information on seed and seedlings to subsidize scientific studies and the propagation and management of these species was the objective of this study. Bio-morphology of the fruits, seeds and seedlings, and a comparative botanical description, allow the distinction of both species. The natural distribution, abundance and phenology are presented, as well as factors which may influence the natural regeneration, as the high seed predation and the infestation by Hypsipyla grandella. Roba-mahogany trees have large seeds (with an average weight of 25 g - C. guianensis and 16 g - C. procera) with a regular fructification. However, there are difficulties in seedling production due to desiccation and chilling sensitivity of the seeds. The thickness of the seed coat may cause dormancy of C. guianensis, which may delay the germination until six months. Seeds of C. procera, which normally have a thinner seed coat need in average only one month to germinate. Nursery practices and planting, as well as the use of these species are commented.

TI  - Mineral nutrient concentrations as a function of seed size within seed crops: implications for competition among seedlings and defence against herbivory
PY  - 1998
AB  - The intra-crop variation in the concentrations of major nutrients in the embryo-cum-endosperm (EE) fraction of seeds of 12 tree species of SE Asian lowland rain forest was investigated. Increased seed size was associated with a significant decrease in the EE concentration of N in 10 species, P and K in seven, Mg in six, and Ca in four. In contrast, the EE nutrient content increased with seed size, typically by about 1.6-fold where seed mass was 2-fold greater. In three species the allocation to protective tissues decreased with increased seed size. The results are potentially relevant to competition among young seedlings, optimal foraging by predators, allocation to defence by plants, and understanding the controls on filling of seeds.

TI  - Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes
PY  - 1993
AB  - Modern survival analysis and more general event history analysis may be effectively handled in the mathematical framework of counting processes, stochastic integration, martingale central limit theory and product integration. This book presents this theory, which has been the subject of an intense research activity during the past one-and-a-half decades. The exposition of the theory is integrated with the careful presentation of many practical examples, based almost exlusively on the authors' experience, with detailed numerical and graphical illustrations. "Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes" may be viewed as a research monograph for mathematical statisticians and biostatisticians, although almost all methods are given in sufficient detail to be used in practice by other mathematically oriented researchers studying event histories (demographers, econometricians, epidemiologists, actuariala mathematicians, reliability engineers, biologists). Much of the material has so far only been available in the journal literature (if at all), and a wide variety of researchers will find this an invlauable survey of the subject.

TI  - Observing seed removal: remote video monitoring of seed selection, predation and dispersal.
PY  - 2004
AB  - A study was conducted during 1996-2000 in an undisturbed tropical lowland rain forest site with an intact fauna at the Nouragues Biological Station, French Guiana, to demonstrate the potential of automated remote video monitoring for studying seed removal and seed fate. In addition, data in 1998 at Speulderbos, a mixed oak-beech forest in the Netherlands, were used. In Nouragues, a suite of different animals, including most of the ungulate and terrestrial rodent species occurring in the study area, and many other terrestrial animals. Acouchies (Myoprocta acouchy) were the first to discover seed plots in 96% of the cases and were always earlier than agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina). An important determinant of the ability of species to obtain seeds was their activity rhythm. Acouchies showed a strong apparent response to food abundance. Peccaries, in contrast, were only recorded around noon and only in low seed years, but this pattern may have been an artefact of the low number of encounters. Peccaries and squirrels removed few of the seeds (peccaries removed 5% of Carapa procera, squirrels 2% of Licania alba), yet they accounted for an important part of seed mortality. Acouchies accounted for majority of recorded removal in both Carapa (62%) and Licania (60%). Agoutis, finally, were less important seed removers than acouchies. Agoutis were two to six times heaviers than acouchies. No significant difference in dispersal distance between agoutis and acouchies was found at least not for the first 25 m. Both rapid removal and greater dispersal distance indicate a higher motivation of rodents to carefully store the seeds. If this pattern holds for other species and habitats, rapid seed removal could be a sign of higher-quality seed dispersal rather than higher predation. Agoutis and acouchies in French Guiana and wood mice in the Netherlands remove and disperse only seed at a time. The interval time between visits was proportional to the investment of rodents in scatterhoarding and their performance as seed dispersers, and can be used as a potential estimate of dispersal under incomplete seed retrieval.

TI  - CACHE MANAGEMENT BY SMALL MAMMALS: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ACORN-EMBRYO EXCISION
PY  - 2001
AB  - We conducted 2 field experiments to assess relative importance of acorn-embryo excision in the caching decisions of small mammals. In the 1st, we selectively provisioned small mammals with metal-tagged acorns of red oak (Quercus rubra) and white oak (Q. alba) at 40 point locations in 8 sites in an oak forest in northeastern Pennsylvania. We then followed the fate of cached seeds by relocating acorns with metal detectors soon after they were cached and again in spring after seeds began to germinate. At least 1 species of small mammal excised embryos of .70% of the cached acorns of white oak and ,4% of those of red oak. Animals also were observed to revisit caches in spring and excise embryos of germinating acorns. More excised acorns of white oak were found intact in spring than those of red oak, indicating that the behavior is important for long-term storage of these seeds. In a 2nd experiment, we presented free-ranging Mexican gray squirrels (Sciurus aureogaster) with pairs of acorns of 5 native white oak and 5 native red oak species and recorded caching events and whether or not cached seeds had their embryos removed. Squirrels cached significantly more acorns of white oak species, frequently excised embryos of these seeds, and only excised embryos of red oaks when they were germinating. These results support our previous hypothesis that the behavior of embryo excision is geographically widespread and has important implications for cache-management strategies of some diurnal tree squirrels and their effect on dispersal of oaks.

PY  - 1999
AB  - This study described the diet of the orange-lrumped agouti Dasyprocta leporina in French Guiana. Five food types were identified in stomach contents: seeds, pulp, fibre, leaves and animal matter. D. leporina ate mainly firuit parts, pulp and seeds, although the ingestion of animals, leaves and fibr-e was not negligible. Food intake differed firom one season to another. D. leporila was a pulp-eater (64.8% pulp in March) when fleshy firuit was plentiful and available on the ground (February-May). The level of pulp ingestion was globally in accordance witlh fiuit production. When food resources were low June-September), D. leporitna con- sumed seeds and cotyledons (73.0% seeds in August) as well as animal (16.4% in July) and to a lesser level, plant parts. By focusing on1 other food categories, and particularly seeds, it gets nutritious food thus avoiding starvation between June- September. Large proportions of seeds appeared in stomach contents and colrela- tioins between seed quantities and ground production wele negative and signific- ant; D. leporinia seemed to react to environmental factols such as rainfall and fiuit pr-oduction.

TI  - Seed Dispersal and Frugivory. Ecology, Evolution and Conservation - The Role of Seed Size in Dispersal by a Scatter-hoarding Rodent
PY  - 2002
AB  - A field experiment was conducted in the Nouragues Reserve, an undisturbed lowland rain forest in French Guiana, to test possible selective pressures towards higher seed value of Carapa procera by scatter-hoarders, and to quantify survival probabilities of seeds harvested and cached by red acouchies (Myoprocta exilis). The following hypotheses were also tested: (1) large seeds are more likely to be harvested by acouchies than small seeds; (2) large seeds are harvested by acouchies more quickly than small seeds; (3) large seeds harvested by acouchies have a higher probability than small seeds to be cached rather than eaten; (4) large seeds are cached further away and in lower densities than small seeds; (5) large seeds are recovered from caches and consumed at lower rates than small seeds; and (6) large seeds have higher survival probabilities than small seeds. All seeds were removed within 1.5 days, except for three seeds, which were removed 1-2 days later, thus hypothesis 1 was not confirmed. A total of 362 seeds were located after dispersal wherein 84% was cached and relatively few seeds (16%) were eaten, which confirms hypothesis 3. The distance at which acouchy caches were found immediately after dispersal was highly variable, both within and among plots. The nearest cache was found <1 m from the plot, from which the farthest was 124 m away. Cache distance increased with seed size, as predicted by hypothesis 4. There was also great variation in spatial isolation of acouchy caches, both within and among plots. Recovery of seeds did not necessarily lead to seed consumption since many seeds were reached or were not found again. Larger seeds had a higher probability of being recached rather than eaten while consumed seeds were found much closer to the cache site than recached seeds. These results support hypothesis 5. Seed mass strongly affected the fate pathways of seeds and how long seeds were kept in stock. The ultimate probability of survival increased with seed mass, as posited by hypothesis 6.

 trail 1 000 to 1 500 m long and 1 m wide were noted every second week, and
 all flowers and fruits which fell on the trail were collected and weighed. The
 following results were obtained :
 Fertility was always low, less than 50 % of the trees over 45 cm DBH
 bearing fruit during the two yearly cycles. Fertility also varied from one year
 to the next, being higher during the second yearly cycle. However, some trees
 which flowered normally never bore fruit.
 Most tree species (from 76 to 80 %, depending on the year) flowered
 during the « dry » season and bore fruit during the rainy season (86 to 88 %).
 The seeds of most of the species (56 %) germinated in less than one month in
 experimental conditions, and 22,2 % in more than 4 months.
 Seasonality in reproduction occured in all species of dicotyle donous trees,
 whatever their size or age (from 2 to > 60 cm DBH). It was far less marked
 in understorey trees, epiphytes and woody lianas. Seasonality in fruiting was
 particularly marked among species bearing fleshy fruits disseminated by animals,
 although some were produced at any time of the year. Seasonality was also marked among wind-dispersed and autochorous tree species. Among trees
 bearing fleshy fruits, those with the larger seeds were much more seasonal than
 those with smaller seeds. Finally, the species which were moderately abundant
 on the sampling transect were more seasonal than both the scarcer and the most
 abundant ones. Mast fruiting was observed in 8 spe cies of Eschweilera and
 Lecythis (Lecythidaceae). In the rain forest studied, the fruiting peak mostly
 results, at the species level, from the adjustment of the maturation period to
 the flowering time.
 Biotic factors undoubtedly play an important role in determining fruiting
 peaks at the community ievel

TI  - VERTEBRATE PREDATION OF BRAZIL-NUTS (BERTHOLLETIA EXCELSA, LECYTHIDACEAE),AN AGOUTI-DISPERSED AMAZONIAN SEED CROP : A TEST OF THE ESCAPE HYPOTHESIS
PY  - 1997
AB  - The effects of escape distance to parental trees and tree clusters on the removal of Brazil-nut seeds (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae) by vertebrate seed predators were examined in an entirely undisturbed stand of Brazil-nut trees of eastern Amazonia. Population density estimates, based on line-transect censuses, are also presented for Bertholletia trees and agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina), the most important scatterhoarder and seed predator of Brazil-nuts at this site. Seed removal experiments were conducted within and outside a natural Bertholletia tree cluster (castanhal) during both the wet and dry seasons. While there were no within-cluster effects of escape distance from parent trees on seed removal rates, overall seed removal within the cluster was significantly greater than that well outside the cluster. Moreover, removal rates in the wet season were consistently higher than those in the dry season both within and outside the tree cluster. Results suggest that the probability of early seed survival for Bertholletia, in relation to distance to seed sources, operates on different spatial scales, and that seed predators allocate greater foraging effort to scattered seeds during the fruitfall (wet) season, when buried seed stocks are being cached by agoutis.

TI  - MÉTODOS SIMPLES DE ARMAZENAMENTO DAS SEMENTES DE ANDIROBA (Carapa guianensisAubl. e Carapa proceraD.C. -Meliaceae).
PY  - 1996
AB  - It was intended to test several simple storage methods, which could be wildly used to conserve recalcitrant seeds of forest trees, whose reforestation is limited by the shortage of its seeds. Carapa procerae C. guianensisare tropical trees of economic interest, its seeds loose viability few days after collection. It was already shown, that for C. procera this loss of viability is correlated with the moisture content of the seeds. The storage of the seeds in plastic bags were studied during 7 months under different environmental conditions and in water. The moisture content of the seeds was observed before and after the storage. Storage under external conditions was not successful, probably because the plastic bags were destroyed by insects which caused dehydration of the seeds, or hydration of those stored in the soil, which then consequently started to germinate. Storage under current water was not possible; neither storage at low temperature (6 °C +/- 4 °C). It was possible to maintain the viability of the seeds in sealed plastic bags under air conditioning (25°C +/- 4 °C and 45 - 60% r. H.) during 7 months.

TI  - REMOVAL OF SEEDS OF CARAPA PROCERA (MELIACEAE) BY RODENTS AND THEIR FATE IN RAINFOREST IN FRENCH GUIANA
PY  - 1996
AB  - Experiments were performed to investigate monthly variations in seed fate of Carapa procera (Meliaceae), a rodent-dispersed subcanopy tree species in French Guiana. A total of 600 thread-marked seeds were placed on the ground in mature forest under 20 adult trees during different months (March, April and May 1991) of the species' fruiting season. In 1991 the seed crop reached 1536 seeds in the study area, with a majority of seeds being produced in March and May. On average, seed removal rate steadily increased from March (23%) to May (96%). Of the seeds removed, the proportion eached almost doubled between March (28%)-April (25%) and May (48%), whereas the proportion eaten (gnawed) steadily declined between March (43%) and May (9%). Approximately 75–100% seed removal was therefore associated with intense scatterhoarding and low seed predation, especially in May. Greater seed dispersal rates occurred during the late wet season when fruit diversity decreased but when overall fruit biomass peaked because of fruiting occurrence of large-seeded species. The seasonal hoarding behaviour of rodents is discussed.

TI  - The effects of seed value on the caching behavior of yellow pine chipmunks
PY  - 1995
AB  - Yellow pine chipmunks scatter-hoard a variety of seed types, and these seeds vary considerably in their inherent value to the chipmunks. Models of optimal scatter hoarding behavior predict that animals should space items of greater value farther apart than items of lesser value to discourage theft from cache robbers. This prediction was tested by comparing how yellow pine chipmunks Tamias amoenus distribute Jeffrey pine Pinus jeffreyi and antelope bitterbrush Purshia tridentata seeds to cache sites. Chipmunks prefer Jeffrey pine seeds over bitterbrush seeds ; the pine seeds provide energy 3.8 times faster and contain a higher proportion of fat than bitterbrush seeds. The prediction of the model was upheld on several counts : chipmunks carry Jeffrey pine seeds farther from source plants to cache sites, they space Jeffrey pine seed caches farther apart, and they place fewer Jeffrey pine seeds than bitterbrush seeds in individual caches. Yellow pine chipmunks appear to be sensitive to the qualities of the food items they store and modify their caching behavior to reduce loss of more valuable food items.

TI  - Ecology and social life of the red acouchy, Myoprocta exilis; comparison with the orange-rumped agouti, Dasyprocta leporina
PY  - 1988
AB  - Red acouchies were observed in French Guiana, and compared with agoutis. Acouchies frequent all forest habitats except disturbed areas. Strictly diurnal, they show most activity in early morning. Males prefer open forests, females closed habitats. The size of home ranges and the level of activity decrease in the dry season when food resources are at a minimum. The social unit is the family, one male and one female with juveniles. Family units are separated from each other. Each individual occupies a small home range which has several much-frequented areas and many resting places, often located in hollow logs and consisting of one nest in use and several old leafheaps. There are no food reserves in the nest: fruits are buried over the whole home range. Within each social unit, every individual mainly lives alone and home ranges have little overlap. The percentage of males decreases from the juvenile to the adult stage. Populations show large year to year density variations. The red acouchy is not similar to the agouti, but instead represents an unique adaptation among the terrestrial forest herbivores.

TI  - DAMAGE AND HERBIVORY TOLERANCE THROUGH RESPROUTING AS AN ADVANTAGE OF LARGE SEED SIZE IN TROPICAL TREES AND LIANAS
PY  - 1997
AB  - In her review of the adaptive value of large seed size for tropical trees of moist forests, Foster (1986) listed several potential advantages of large seeds. One advantage to having large seed reserves may be to enhance seedling tolerance to herbivory and to damage by providing energy and material for tissue replacement (Foster 1986). Phylogenetically independent contrasts of a range of Australian species have shown that large-seeded species generally tolerate defoliation better than smaller-seeded species (Armstrong & Westoby 1993). However, such comparative experiments are lacking for tropical woody species. The capacity to tolerate herbivory and physical damage may be especially important in tropical forests. Denslow (1980) found severe homopteran damage to the apical meristems of 66% of the seedlings of a bombacaceous tree species of the rainforest in Antioquia, Colombia. Clark & Clark (1985, 1989, 1991) have shown that severe damage from falling debris and herbivores is widespread and common among seedlings in lowland rainforest of Costa Rica. For example, 82% of model seedlings were 'knocked over, flattened, or uprooted' in a 1-y experiment (Clark & Clark 1989). Furthermore, very young seedlings are likely to be especially vulnerable, since many herbivorous insects prefer newly expanded leaves (Coley 1983). In this study we asked: Are large-seeded woody species of moist tropical forests better able to tolerate severe seedling damage than smaller-seeded woody species? We evaluated this question by determining the resprouting

TI  - MATERNAL EFFECTS IN PLANTS
PY  - 1987
AB  - Maternal effects in plants were recognized as long ago as 1909 (32). Recent evidence, primarily over the last 15-20 years, shows that maternal effects can contribute substantially to the phenotype of an individual, and as we show, this has important consequences for the interpretation and' design of both ecofogical and genetic studies. Following a discussion of the consequences of maternal effects and an analysis of the different ways these effects can be estimated, we review the evidence for maternal effects from the fields of physiological ecology, crop science, and quantitative genetics. We do not review all of the literature because that would be a monumental task; rather, we focus on representative studies from each of these fields. It is our contention that despite evidence that maternal effects can have a large in­ fluence on offspring phenotype, few detailed studies have identified the specific causes of maternal effects, particularly in natural populations.

TI  - It's time to flower: the genetic control of flowering time
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary In plants, successful sexual reproduction and the ensuing development of seeds and fruits depend on flowering at the right time. This involves coordinating flowering with the appropriate season and with the developmental historyoftheplant.Geneticandmolecular analysisinthe small cruciform weed, Arabidopsis, has revealed distinct butlinkedpathwaysthatareresponsiblefordetectingthe major seasonal cues of day length and cold temperature, as well as other local environmental and internal signals. The balance of signals from these pathways is integrated by a common set of genes to determine when flowering occurs. Excitingly, it has been discovered that many of these same genes regulate flowering in other plants, such as rice. This review focuses on recent advances in how three of the signalling pathways (the day-length, vernalisation and autonomous pathways) function to control flowering.

TI  - Rapid evolution of flowering time by an annual plant in response to a climate fluctuation.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Ongoing climate change has affected the ecological dynamics of many species and is expected to impose natural selection on ecologically important traits. Droughts and other anticipated changes in precipitation may be particularly potent selective factors, especially in arid regions. Here we demonstrate the evolutionary response of an annual plant, Brassica rapa, to a recent climate fluctuation resulting in a multiyear drought. Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed and raised under a set of common environments with descendant (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestordescendant hybrids. As predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9 days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The intermediate flowering time of ancestordescendant hybrids supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few generations. A systematic effort to collect and store propagules from suitable species would provide biologists with materials to detect and elucidate the genetic basis of further evolutionary shifts driven by climate change. contemporary evolution global climate change life history theory local adaptation plant phenology

TI  - Comparing evolvability and variability of quantitative traits.
PY  - 1992
AB  - There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.

TI  - Assessing the speed and predictability of local adaptation in invasive California poppies (Eschscholzia californica)
PY  - 2007
AB  - Insight into the speed and predictability of local adaptation can be gained by studying organisms, such as invasive species, that have recently expanded their geographical ranges. Common garden studies were designed to address these issues with the California poppy, Eschscholzia californica, collected from a wide range of environments in both its native (California) and invasive (Chile) ranges. We found similar patterns of plant trait variation along similar abiotic gradients in plants collected from both areas. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that coastal plants from both areas tended to be shorter, smaller plants with smaller seeds and flowers that germinate and flower later than plants collected from inland locations. In addition, size and fecundity traits in both native and invasive poppies were correlated with average rainfall totals; the plants that grew the largest and were the most fecund during the first year of growth originated from the driest areas. This parallel variation suggests that these traits are adaptive and that these patterns have evolved in Chile during the 110‐150 years since introduction.

TI  - Genetic variation in resistance and tolerance to insect herbivory in Salix cordata
PY  - 1997
AB  - 1. This study investigated whether sand-dune willow Salix cordata, exhibits genetic variation in resistance and tolerance to herbivory.



2. A field experiment using cuttings from nine willow clones demonstrated genetic variation in resistance to the specialist herbivore Altica subplicata, as measured by beetle densities. Willow clones differed significantly in both total biomass and leaf trichome densities, and herbivore densities were marginally correlated with both of these parameters.



3. Tolerance to herbivory was measured in a greenhouse experiment by comparing growth response of plants experiencing 50% artificial defoliation and plants experiencing no defoliation. Clones showed significant differences in tolerance to herbivory for some growth measures (changes in height and number of leaves), but not for other growth measures (stem diameter growth and final biomass).



4. Despite the significant genetic variation in both resistance and tolerance, no trade-off was found between resistance and tolerance to herbivory.

TI  - Phenological Patterns of Terrestrial Plants
PY  - 1985
AB  - The term phenology is derived from the Greek word phaino meaning to show or to appear. Hence, phenology is defined as the study of the seasonal timing of life cycle events. For plants the seasonal timing of such events can be critical to survival and reproduction. In agriculture the most common failure of introduced crops is the inability to adjust to the seasons imposed by the new, environment (68). In the past few years, interest in the ecology and evolution of timing of life cycle events has grown. Here we review the literature on phenological patterns of germination, flowering, and fruiting (including dispersal).

TI  - THE BIONOMICS OF APION ULICIS FÖRST. (GORSE WEEVIL), WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ITS ROLE IN THE CONTROL OF ULEX EUROPAEUS IN NEW ZEALAND†
PY  - 1928
AB  - Summary. 
1The present study of Apion vlicis Forst. is in reference to the use of this weevil in the control of Ulex europaeus in New Zealand: its synonymy and geographical distribution are dealt with.
2The external morphology of the egg, larva, pupa and imago of Apion ulicis have been studied, special attention being devoted to the mouth parts of both adult and larva. The male and female reproductive organs are also described and figured.
3The details of its life-history and feeding habits are given and an account of the damage caused by both adult and larva is included.
4A survey of 62 districts in Great Britain has been organised and as high as 92 per cent. pod infection has been observed.
5Primary attention has been given to the possibility of Apion ulicis attacking economic plants. It was found that only leguminous plants need be considered, and of these oviposition only occurred in pods of Ulex europaeus. Tests to ascertain the ability of Apion ulicis to thrive on other leguminous plants gave entirely negative results.
6A parasite identified as Splintherus leguminum, Ratz. has been bred, a 4 per cent. parasitism was estimated. Three other records of parasites of Apion ulicis are quoted.

TI  - EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL OF CHAMAECRISTA FASCICULATA IN RELATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I. CLINAL PATTERNS OF SELECTION ALONG AN ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT IN THE GREAT PLAINS
PY  - 2004
AB  - Climate change will alter natural selection on native plant populations. Little information is available to predict how selection will change in the future and how populations will respond. Insight can be obtained by comparing selection regimes in current environments to selection regimes in environments similar to those predicted for the future. To mimic predicted temporal change in climate, three natural populations of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata were sampled from a climate gradient in the Great Plains and progeny of formal crosses were reciprocally planted back into common gardens across this climate gradient. In each garden, native populations produced significantly more seed than the other populations, providing strong evidence of local adaptation. Phenotypic selection analysis conducted by site showed that plants with slower reproductive development, more leaves, and thicker leaves were favored in the most southern garden. Evidence of clinal variation in selection regimes was also found; selection coefficients were ordered according to the latitude of the common gardens. The adaptive value of native traits was indicated by selection toward the mean of local populations. Repeated clinal patterns in linear and nonlinear selection coefficients among populations and within and between sites were found. To the extent that temporal change in climate into the future will parallel the differences in selection across this spatial gradient, this study suggests that selection regimes will be displaced northward and different trait values will be favored in natural populations.

TI  - Induction of plant responses to oviposition and feeding by herbivorous arthropods: a comparison
PY  - 2002
AB  - Plants may respond both to feeding and oviposition by herbivorous insects. While responses of plants to feeding damage by herbivores have been studied intensively during the past decades, only a few, but growing number of studies consider the reactions of plants towards egg deposition by herbivorous insects. Plants showing defensive response to oviposition by herbivores do not ‘wait’ until being damaged by feeding, but may instead react towards one of the initial steps of herbivore attack, the egg deposition. Direct plant defensive responses to feeding act directly against the feeding stages of the herbivores. However, a plant may also show direct defensive responses to egg deposition by (a) formation of neoplasms, (b) formation of necrotic tissue (= hypersensitive response), and (c) production of oviposition deterrents. All these plant reactions have directly negative effects on the eggs, hatching larvae, or on the ovipositing females. Indirect plant defensive responses to feeding result in the emission of volatiles (= synomones) that attract predators or parasitoids of the feeding stages. A few recent studies have shown that plants are able to emit volatiles also in response to egg deposition and that these volatiles attract egg parasitoids. Studies on the mechanisms of induction of synomones by egg deposition show several parallels to the mechanisms of induction of plant responses by feeding damage. When considering induced plant defence against herbivores from an evolutionary point of view, the question arises whether herbivores evolved the ability to circumvent or even to exploit the plant’s defensive responses. The reactions of herbivores to oviposition induced plant responses are compared with their reactions to feeding induced plant responses.

TI  - Resistance of Salix caprea, S. phylicifolia, and their F1 hybrids to herbivores and pathogens.
PY  - 2000
AB  - AbstractTraits that make plants unpalatable to herbivores are often believed to have evolved as a response to herbivory. Thus, it has been suggested that the genetic re-combinations that occur when plants hybridize might result in a breakdown in plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens. In this study, we tested whether hybrid plants are less resistant to herbivores and pathogens than the parental species under controlled environmental conditions. Two common and widespread willow species, the tree-forming Salix caprea L. and the shrub-forming S. phylicifolia Sm. (L.) and their F1 hybrids were used in the study. To control the origin of plant material used in the experiments, we hand-pollinated plants in the field to create F1 hybrids and pure parental individuals, which were potted and kept outdoors in an experimental field. During the third growing season we measured plant survival, leaf numbers, and the densities of three species (gallers and leaf-folders of sub-genus Pontania and Phyllocolpa) of gal...

TI  - Effects of population size, seed predation and plant size on male and female reproductive success in Vincetoxicum hirundinaria (Asclepiadaceae)
PY  - 2002
AB  - Here we present the results of a study on the effects of population size, seed predation, and plant size on male and female reproductive success in ten Vincetoxicum hirundinaria populations in southwestern Finland. We investigated male reproductive success by recording pollinia removal, and studying pollen quality and quantity. Pod and seed production, and the number of ovules per ovary were counted to estimate female reproductive success. Both pollen quality and pollinia removal were higher in small V. hirundinaria populations compared to large populations. In contrast, the quantity of pollen was higher in large populations than in small populations. Pod initiation was higher in large populations. However, large populations had higher abortion rates and proportionally fewer intact pods. Plant size did not affect male reproductive success whereas pod and seed production correlated positively with plant size, although only in large populations. Population size had no clear impact on seed predation intensities. Variation was, however, observed among populations. Larger plant individuals suffered from an increased risk of being attacked only in two populations. This correlation was not clearly attributed to plant population size. The results of this study suggest that reproductive success in V. hirundinaria may be highly variable and this variation is to some extent explained by population size. Further, population size affected male and female reproductive success differently.

TI  - Genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity in flowering phenology in populations of two grasses
PY  - 2002
AB  - QUINN, J. A. (Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901-1582) AND J. D. WETHERINGTON (Biometrics Division, DuPont Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE 19880-0721). Genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity in flowering phenology in populations of two grasses. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 129:96-106. 2002.-Genetic differentiation in flowering phenology has been frequently demonstrated among populations of wide-ranging species. However, fine-tuning of flowering phenology, i.e., responses to yearly fluctuations in the local environment, should best be accomplished via phenotypic plasticity. To test theoretical expectations as to the interaction of genetic differentiation and plasticity, and conditions under which each should be most important, populations of the inbreeding Sporobolus cryptandrus and the outbreeding Panicum virgatum were compared in genetic variation among clones and in amounts and patterns of plasticity in phenology. For each species, three years of data from replicated blocks of cloned genotypes in a common garden near Fort Collins, Colorado, were treated as characters measured in three environments as a way of quantifying "environmental sensitivity" and partitioning the variance in flowering time. The three years provided major differences in length of growing season, temperatures, precipitation, and evaporation rates. The outbreeding species possessed the greatest genetic variation among clones in a population, while the inbreeding species showed less genetic variation within and more between populations. Populations of both species varied significantly in amount and highly significantly in pattern of plasticity. The long-lived, clonal Panicum showed a significantly greater plasticity than the short-lived, non-clonal Sporobolus. The plasticity variance component was the largest component overall for Sporobolus, which is found over the widest range of environments heterogeneous in space and time, and there was a highly significant relation between a population's ecological history and the relative importance of plasticity in flowering phenology. The two species did not show a consistent relationship between amounts of clonal genetic variation and plasticity, emphasizing that experiments on a diversity of species are required to appropriately test theoretical expectations.

TI  - The joint evolution of mating system, floral traits and life history in Clarkia (Onagraceae): genetic constraints vs. independent evolution.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Genetic correlations caused by pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium may influence the joint evolution of multiple traits as populations or taxa diverge. The evolutionary transition from outcrossing to selfing has occurred numerous times and is often accompanied by phenotypic and genetic changes in multiple traits such as flower size, pollen-ovule ratio, stigma and anther maturity and the age of reproductive maturity. Determining whether the recurring patterns of multitrait change are because of selection on each trait independently and/or the result of genetic correlations among traits can shed light on the mechanism that accounts for such convergence. Here, we evaluate whether floral traits are genetically correlated with each other and/or with whole-plant traits within- and between-populations and taxa. We report results from a greenhouse study conducted on two pairs of sister taxa with contrasting mating systems: the autogamously selfing Clarkia exilis and its predominantly outcrossing progenitor C. unguiculata and the autogamous Clarkia xantiana ssp. parviflora and its outcrossing progenitor C. xantiana ssp. xantiana. We examined variation within and covariation among maternal families in three populations of each taxon with respect to the age at first flower, the rate of successive flower production and the number of days between bud break and anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity within individual flowers. Based on phenotypic divergence between sister taxa, bivariate regressions, correlations among maternal family means and analysis of covariance (ancova), we did not find unilateral support indicating that genetic constraints govern the joint distribution of floral and whole-plant traits.

TI  - Fecundity above the Species Level: Ovule Number and Brood Size in the Genisteae (Fabaceae: Papilionoideae)
PY  - 1999
AB  - Per-fruit components of fecundity (ovules per ovary, seeds per fruit, seed : ovule ratio, and patterns of seed maturation within pods) were studied in 33 species of the Genisteae, a legume tribe of mostly Mediterranean shrubs, e.g., Cytisus, Ulex, that also includes more widespread herbs such as Lupinus. Species identity explained most variance in both potential (ovules) and realized (seeds per fruit and seed : ovule ratio) fecundity, and although significant population-specific effects existed, these were relatively small, indicating that estimates of fecundity were not particularly prone to environment-induced changes. Average seed : ovule ratios varied between 20% (for a few species in which fixed rates of embryo abortion result into single seeded pods) and 100% (annuals), but most taxa were in the 40%-60% range. The probability that an ovule near the base of the ovary matured into a seed was significantly lower than the pod average in the majority of species. As indicated by the large size of stigmatic pollen loads, this was unlikely to result from insufficient pollination but rather from preferential embryo abortion. High abortion rates next to pod base occurred in both presumed selfers and obligate outcrossers. Evidence points to relatively stereotyped reproductive ways and high reproductive coherence in the tribe, with major departures from the norm being high seed : ovule ratios exhibited by annual Lupinus (associated with selfing), and low ratios shown by species with single seeded pods (associated with fixed rates of embryo abortion).

TI  - Architecture of coastal and desert Encelia farinosa (Asteraceae): consequences of plastic and heritable variation in leaf characters.
PY  - 2002
AB  - The shrub Encelia farinosa (Asteraceae) exhibits geographic variation in aboveground architecture and leaf traits in parallel with environmental variation in temperature and moisture. Measurements of plants occurring across a natural gradient demonstrated that plants in desert populations produce smaller, more pubescent leaves and are more compact and branched than plants in more mesic coastal environments. This phenotypic variation is interpreted in part as adaptive genetic differentiation; small size and pubescence reduce leaf temperature and thus increase water-use efficiency but at the cost of lower photosynthetic rate, which results in slower growth and more compact growth form. We explored the basis of phenotypic variation by planting seed offspring from coastal and desert populations in common gardens in both environments. Phenotypic differences among populations persisted in both common gardens, suggesting a genetic basis for trait variation. Desert offspring outperformed coastal offspring in the desert garden, suggesting superior adaptation to hot, dry conditions. Herbivore damage was greater for all offspring in the coastal garden. Phenotypic characters also showed plastic responses; all offspring had smaller, more pubescent leaves and more compact growth form in the desert garden. Our results confirm that leaf size and pubescence are heritable characters associated with pronounced variation in plant architecture.

TI  - Adaptive evolution in invasive species.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Many emerging invasive species display evidence of rapid adaptation. Contemporary genetic studies demonstrate that adaptation to novel environments can occur within 20 generations or less, indicating that evolutionary processes can influence invasiveness. However, the source of genetic or epigenetic variation underlying these changes remains uncharacterised. Here, we review the potential for rapid adaptation from standing genetic variation and from new mutations, and examine four types of evolutionary change that might promote or constrain rapid adaptation during the invasion process. Understanding the source of variation that contributes to adaptive evolution in invasive plants is important for predicting future invasion scenarios, identifying candidate genes involved in invasiveness, and, more generally, for understanding how populations can evolve rapidly in response to novel and changing environments.

Here we present a detailed characterization of the ba1 mutant phenotype, including scanning electron microscopy of developing inflorescences, in situ hybridization analysis using a meristem marker, molecular mapping, and genetic analysis demonstrating an epistatic relationship between ba1 and teosinte branched1 (tb1). These data show that the primary defect in the ba1 mutant is a failure in axillary meristem development.

TI  - Seasonal and plant-density dependency for quantitative trait loci affecting flowering time in multiple populations of Arabidopsis thaliana.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Multiple environmental cues regulate the transition to flowering. In natural environments, plants perceive seasonal progression by changes in day length and growth temperature, and plant density is monitored by changes in the light quality reflected from neighbouring vegetation. To understand the seasonal and plant-density dependence associated with natural allelic variation in flowering time, we conducted a quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping study in Ler x Cvi, Bay x Sha and Ler x No-0 recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations of Arabidopsis thaliana. Days and total leaf number to bolting were examined under low and high plant density (200 or 1600 plants m(-2)) in autumn-winter and spring seasons. We found between 4 and 10 QTLs associated with seasonal and density variations in each RIL population. For Ler x Cvi and Bay x Sha RIL populations, a major proportion of QTLs showed seasonal and density interaction (up to 63%) and four QTLs were common to all environments (21%). Only three QTLs showed seasonal or density dependency. By aligning the linkage maps onto a common physical map, we detected at least one QTL at chromosome 2 and two QTLs at chromosome 5 that overlap between the three RIL populations, suggesting that these QTLs play a crucial role in the adaptive control of flowering time.

TI  - High genetic diversity in French invasive populations of common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, as a result of multiple sources of introduction
PY  - 2005
AB  - Ambrosia artemisiifolia is an aggressive North American annual weed, found particularly in sunflower and corn fields. Besides its economic impact on crop yield, it represents a major health problem because of its strongly allergenic pollen. Ragweed was imported inadvertently to Europe in the 18th century and has become invasive in several countries, notably in the Rhone Valley of France. It has recently expanded in both the Provence-Alpes-Cote-d’Azur and Bourgogne regions. As first steps towards understanding the causes and mechanisms of ragweed invasion, genetic variability of French and North American populations was analysed using microsatellites. Overall genetic variability was similar in North America and in the Rhone-Alpes region, but within-population levels of genetic variability were surprisingly lower in native than in invasive French populations. French populations also exhibited lower among-population differentiation. A significant pattern of isolation by distance was detected among North American populations but not among French populations. Assignment tests and distribution of rare alleles did not point to a single origin for all French populations, nor for all individuals within populations and private alleles from different North American populations were found in the same French populations. Indeed, within all French populations, individual plants were roughly equally assigned to the different North American populations. Altogether, these results suggest that the French invasive populations include plants from a mixture of sources. Reduced diversity in populations distant from the original area of introduction indicated that ragweed range expansion probably occurred through sequential bottlenecks from the original populations, and not from subsequent new introductions.

TI  - Evolutionary origins of invasive populations
PY  - 2008
AB  - What factors shape the evolution of invasive populations? Recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that an evolutionary history of disturbance might be an important factor. This perspective presents hypotheses regarding the impact of disturbance on the evolution of invasive populations, based on a synthesis of the existing literature. Disturbance might select for life-history traits that are favorable for colonizing novel habitats, such as rapid population growth and persistence. Theoretical results suggest that disturbance in the form of fluctuating environments might select for organismal flexibility, or alternatively, the evolution of evolvability. Rapidly fluctuating environments might favor organismal flexibility, such as broad tolerance or plasticity. Alternatively, longer fluctuations or environmental stress might lead to the evolution of evolvability by acting on features of the mutation matrix. Once genetic variance is generated via mutations, temporally fluctuating selection across generations might promote the accumulation and maintenance of genetic variation. Deeper insights into how disturbance in native habitats affects evolutionary and physiological responses of populations would give us greater capacity to predict the populations that are most likely to tolerate or adapt to novel environments during habitat invasions. Moreover, we would gain fundamental insights into the evolutionary origins of invasive populations.

TI  - Phenotypic and genetic differentiation between native and introduced plant populations
PY  - 2005
AB  - Plant invasions often involve rapid evolutionary change. Founder effects, hybridization, and adaptation to novel environments cause genetic differentiation between native and introduced populations and may contribute to the success of invaders. An influential idea in this context has been the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis. It proposes that after enemy release plants rapidly evolve to be less defended but more competitive, thereby increasing plant vigour in introduced populations. To detect evolutionary change in invaders, comparative studies of native versus introduced populations are needed. Here, we review the current empirical evidence from: (1) comparisons of phenotypic variation in natural populations; (2) comparisons of molecular variation with neutral genetic markers; (3) comparisons of quantitative genetic variation in a common environment; and (4) comparisons of phenotypic plasticity across different environments. Field data suggest that increased vigour and reduced herbivory are common in introduced plant populations. In molecular studies, the genetic diversity of introduced populations was not consistently different from that of native populations. Multiple introductions of invasive plants appear to be the rule rather than the exception. In tests of the EICA hypothesis in a common environment, several found increased growth or decreased resistance in introduced populations. However, few provided a full test of the EICA hypothesis by addressing growth and defence in the same species. Overall, there is reasonable empirical evidence to suggest that genetic differentiation through rapid evolutionary change is important in plant invasions. We discuss conceptual and methodological issues associated with cross-continental comparisons and make recommendations for future research. When testing for EICA, greater emphasis should be put on competitive ability and plant tolerance. Moreover, it is important to address evolutionary change in characteristics other than defence and growth that could play a role in plant invasions.

TI  - A comparison of methods to estimate cross-environment genetic correlations
PY  - 2006
AB  - Advanced techniques for quantitative genetic parameter estimation may not always be necessary to answer broad genetic questions. However, simpler methods are often biased, and the extent of this determines their usefulness. In this study we compare family mean correlations to least squares and restricted error maximum likelihood (REML) variance component approaches to estimating cross-environment genetic correlations. We analysed empirical data from studies where both types of estimates were made, and from studies in our own laboratories. We found that the agreement between estimates was better when full-sib rather than half-sib estimates of cross-environment genetic correlations were used and when mean family size increased. We also note biases in REML estimation that may be especially important when testing to see if correlations differ from 0 or 1. We conclude that correlations calculated from family means can be used to test for the presence of genetic correlations across environments, which is sufficient for some research questions. Variance component approaches should be used when parameter estimation is the objective, or if the goal is anything other than determining broad patterns.

TI  - The role of evolution in the invasion process.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Biological invasions occur when organisms are transported and become established in a new range in which they persist, proliferate, and spread (1). The negative consequences of invasions include loss of native biological diversity and community structure (and in extreme cases, the extinction of native species) (2); modification of ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and productivity patterns; alteration of disturbance regimes, especially the frequency of wildfires (3); reduced agricultural productivity; human health concerns; and enormous economic costs (1, 4). Consequently, invasive species are now considered to be one of the leading contributors to global change (5) and thus have been the focus of an extensive amount of ecological and ecosystem-level research. Much of this research has focused on answering a series of questions associated with predicting invasions: Which species will become invasive? Which life-history traits contribute to invasiveness? Which communities are susceptible to invasion? What will be the ecological and ecosystem-level consequences of invasion? Unfortunately, answers to these questions remain elusive (1). It is surprising to note, however, that little research has focused on the evolutionary aspects of biological invasions and addressed how evolutionary mechanisms may contribute to the success of an invasion (2, 6, 7). In contrast, the research of Lavergne and Molofsky (8) reported in this issue of PNAS examines the factors that contribute to range expansion and the invasiveness of Phalaris arundinacea L. (reed canarygrass) in North America and provides powerful insights into the role of evolution in the invasion process.

The invasion process can be viewed as a series of steps that are initiated when propagules of a species (seeds, eggs, larvae, vegetative material, mature individuals, etc.) are sampled in their native range and transported to a new area (1, 4). These immigrants probably experience high mortality rates while in transit, and …

TI  - Inheritance of flowering pattern among four annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) genotypes
PY  - 1998
AB  - Poa annua L. is a turfgrass commonly found on golf course putting greens, as well as many other environments in temperate regions of the world. Although it can produce a very desirable putting surface, the species is usually considered a weed, in part because it is characterized by continuous flowering during the growing season. Flowering at the low mowing heights of a golf green, is detrimental to the putting quality of the green and the stress tolerance of the plants. However, many individuals of P. annua flower only in the spring. We conducted this inheritance study to investigate the genetic control of flowering pattern in four representative genotypes, then relate the information to the ecology of the species in golf course environment, and propose improvements for P. annua breeding. One annual and three perennial tetraploid P. annua genotypes were crossed in all combinations. F 1 , F 2 , and in most cases F 3 populations were grown and observed in field or greenhouse conditions over 1 to 3 yr. Each plant was rated for flowering pattern during the growing season. A genetic model involving one locus and two alleles with continual flowering completely dominant to seasonal flowering is proposed for control of flowering pattern based on F 2 populations exhibiting 3:1 ratios of continual to seasonal flowering pattern types. Three distinct F 3 populations are produced from F 2 progeny: all continual flowering, all seasonal flowering, and segregating 3:1 continual to seasonal, similar to the F 2 generation. There may also be evidence of modifying loci and maternal effects in some populations. This simple inheritance may explain the high heritability of flowering traits and rapid evolution of plant types in golf course turfgrass. Qualitative inheritance also provides the opportunity for effcient selection of desirable seasonal flowering P. annua plants.

TI  - Genetic architecture of fitness and nonfitness traits: empirical patterns and development of ideas.
PY  - 1999
AB  - Comparative studies of the genetic architecture of different types of traits were initially prompted by the expectation that traits under strong directional selection (fitness traits) should have lower levels of genetic variability than those mainly under weak stabilizing selection (nonfitness traits). Hence, early comparative studies revealing lower heritabilities of fitness than nonfitness traits were first framed in terms of giving empirical support for this prediction, but subsequent treatments have effectively reversed this view. Fitness traits seem to have higher levels of additive genetic variance than nonfitness traits — an observation that has been explained in terms of the larger number loci influencing fitness as compared to nonfitness traits. This hypothesis about the larger functional architecture of fitness than nonfitness traits is supported by their higher mutational variability, which is hard to reconcile without evoking capture of mutational variability over many loci. The lower heritabilities of fitness than nonfitness traits, despite the higher additive genetic variance of the former, occur because of their higher residual variances. Recent comparative studies of dominance contributions for different types of traits, together with theoretical predictions and a large body of indirect evidence, suggest an important role of dominance variance in determining levels of residual variance for fitness-traits. The role of epistasis should not be discounted either, since a large number of loci increases the potential for epistatic interactions, and epistasis is strongly implicated in hybrid breakdown.

TI  - Phenotypic selection on flowering synchrony in a high mountain plant, Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae)
PY  - 1993
AB  - 1) In this paper, the effect of flowering synchrony on the reproductive success of Hormathophylla spinosa, a plant living in the Mediterranean high-mountains of the Sierra Nevada (SE Spain), is demonstrated. Eighty plants belonging to three populations were permanently labelled during the period 1988-91, and in each plant the duration and date of flowering as well as the estimated flowering synchrony, were noted. The composition and abundance of the pollinator assemblage, the abundance of the floral herbivores and the effect of the seed and fruit consumers were also recorded. 2) In 1989, 1990 and 1991, the relationship between the flowering synchrony and the three rate-based components of reproductive success (fruit set, brood size and female fertility) were studied

TI  - Increased genetic variation and evolutionary potential drive the success of an invasive grass.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Despite the increasing biological and economic impacts of invasive species, little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that favor geographic range expansion and evolution of invasiveness in introduced species. Here, we focus on the invasive wetland grass Phalaris arundinacea L. and document the evolutionary consequences that resulted from multiple and uncontrolled introductions into North America of genetic material native to different European regions. Continental-scale genetic variation occurring in reed canarygrass' European range has been reshuffled and recombined within North American introduced populations, giving rise to a number of novel genotypes. This process alleviated genetic bottlenecks throughout reed canarygrass' introduced range, including in peripheral populations, where depletion of genetic diversity is expected and is observed in the native range. Moreover, reed canarygrass had higher genetic diversity and heritable phenotypic variation in its invasive range relative to its native range. The resulting high evolutionary potential of invasive populations allowed for rapid selection of genotypes with higher vegetative colonization ability and phenotypic plasticity. Our results show that repeated introductions of a single species may inadvertently create harmful invaders with high adaptive potential. Such invasive species may be able to evolve in response to changing climate, allowing them to have increasing impact on native communities and ecosystems in the future. More generally, multiple immigration events may thus trigger future adaptation and geographic spread of a species population by preventing genetic bottlenecks and generating genetic novelties through recombination.

TI  - Genetic variation in flowering time induces phenological assortative mating: quantitative genetic methods applied to Brassica rapa.
PY  - 2004
AB  - It has been argued from first principles that plants mate assortatively by flowering time. However, there have been very few studies of phenological assortative mating, perhaps because current methods to infer paternal phenotype are difficult to apply to natural populations. Two methods are presented to estimate the phenotypic correlation between mates-the quantitative genetic metric for assortative mating-for phenological traits. The first method uses individual flowering schedules to estimate mating probabilities for every potential pairing in a sample. These probabilities are then incorporated into a weighted phenotypic correlation between all potential mates and thus yield a prospective estimate based on mating opportunities. The correlation between mates can also be estimated retrospectively by comparing the regression of offspring phenotype over one parent, which is inflated by assortative mating, to the regression over mid-parent, which is not. In a demonstration experiment with Brassica rapa, the prospective correlation between flowering times (days from germination to anthesis) of pollen recipients and their potential donors was 0.58. The retrospective estimate of this correlation strongly agreed with the prospective estimate. The prospective method is easily employed in field studies that explore the effect of phenological assortative mating on selection response and population differentiation.

TI  - Genotype-by-environment interactions leads to variable selection on life-history strategy in Common Evening Primrose (Oenothera biennis).
PY  - 2006
AB  - Monocarpic plant species, where reproduction is fatal, frequently exhibit variation in the length of their prereproductive period prior to flowering. If this life-history variation in flowering strategy has a genetic basis, genotype-by-environment interactions (G x E) may maintain phenotypic diversity in flowering strategy. The native monocarpic plant Common Evening Primrose (Oenothera biennis L., Onagraceae) exhibits phenotypic variation for annual vs. biennial flowering strategies. I tested whether there was a genetic basis to variation in flowering strategy in O. biennis, and whether environmental variation causes G x E that imposes variable selection on flowering strategy. In a field experiment, I randomized more than 900 plants from 14 clonal families (genotypes) into five distinct habitats that represented a natural productivity gradient. G x E strongly affected the lifetime fruit production of O. biennis, with the rank-order in relative fitness of genotypes changing substantially between habitats. I detected genetic variation in annual vs. biennial strategies in most habitats, as well as a G x E effect on flowering strategy. This variation in flowering strategy was correlated with genetic variation in relative fitness, and phenotypic and genotypic selection analyses revealed that environmental variation resulted in variable directional selection on annual vs. biennial strategies. Specifically, a biennial strategy was favoured in moderately productive environments, whereas an annual strategy was favoured in low-productivity environments. These results highlight the importance of variable selection for the maintenance of genetic variation in the life-history strategy of a monocarpic plant.

TI  - Plant phenology and seed predation: interactions between gorses and weevils in Brittany (France)
PY  - 2007
AB  - Exapion ulicis (Forster) and Exapion lemovicinum (Hoffmann) (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea: Apionidae) are seed predators of the three gorse species occurring in Brittany (France): Ulex europaeus L., Ulex gallii Planch., and Ulex minor Roth.(Fabaceae). Host-plant phenology plays a major role in the relationship between apionid weevils and their gorse species, because larvae develop within gorse pods and adults have to wait for pod dehiscence to be released. We monitored flowering and fruiting phenology of gorse species, weevil reproductive behaviour, and egg-laying patterns in six natural populations in the native area of these gorse species. At each site, U. europaeus, which flowers mainly in spring, was sympatric with one of two autumn flowering gorse species, U. gallii and U. minor. We noticed that E. ulicis laid eggs in spring and was restricted to U. europaeus whereas E. lemovicinum laid eggs in autumn and was restricted to the two autumn-flowering species U. gallii and U. minor. Therefore, host specificity depended on gorse phenology, and not on geographic proximity. In addition, the infested pod content showed that E. ulicis laid several eggs per pod and suggested that females chose pods with the highest numbers of seeds. In contrast, E. lemovicinum laid a single egg per pod and showed no preference for pods with many seeds. Finally, the impact of seed predation by E. ulicis was higher than that of E. lemovicinum.

TI  - How is the invasive gorse Ulex europaeus pollinated during winter? A lesson from its native range
PY  - 2007
AB  - Many examples of plant-insect interac- tions have shown that selection from herbivores can act on flowering and fruiting phenology. In Ulex europaeus (Fabaceae), escaping seed predation resulted in extended, but variable flowering periods, with some plants flowering from autumn until spring and others flowering only in spring. The present study aims at understanding how gorses can have a high reproductive success during winter despite harsh climatic conditions and low number of pollinators. We measured pollen production, flower size and seed production in spring and winter, and compared the different seasons. The pollination success of flowers was high in both seasons. The flowers produced as much pollen, and were of comparable size in spring and winter, but they stayed open twice as long in winter than in spring. The high pollination rate we observed was thus due to the longer opening period of flowers and the high attractiveness of flowers during winter. However, pod abortion was higher in winter, with 43% of the flowers in winter and 75% in spring producing ripe pods. Antagonistic selective pressures exerted by biotic and abiotic interactions may, therefore, have lead to the observed flowering polymorphism, and allow U. europaeus to thrive in various climates, thus, increasing its invasiveness in different countries.

TI  - Heritable variation and genetic correlation of quantitative traits within and between ecotypes of Avena barbata.
PY  - 2008
AB  - We examined heritable variation for quantitative traits within and between naturally occurring mesic and xeric ecotypes of the slender wild oat (Avena barbata), and in 188 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the ecotypes. We measured a suite of seedling and adult traits in the greenhouse, as well as performance-related traits in field sites native to the two ecotypes. Although the ecotypes were genetically diverged for most traits, few traits showed significant heritable variation within either ecotype. In contrast, considerable heritable variation was released in the recombinant progeny of the cross, and transgressive segregation was apparent in all traits. Heritabilities were substantially greater in the greenhouse than in the field, and this was associated with an increase in environmental variance in the field, rather than a decrease in genetic variance. Strong genetic correlations were evident among the recombinants, such that 22 measured traits could be well represented by only seven underlying factors, which accounted for 80% of the total variation. The primary axis of variation in the greenhouse described a trade-off between vegetative and reproductive allocation, mediated by the date of first flowering, and fitness was strongly correlated with this trade-off. Other factors in the greenhouse described variation in size and in seedling traits. Lack of correlation among these factors represents the release of multivariate trait variation through recombination. In the field, a separate axis of variation in overall performance was found for each year/site combination. Performance was significantly correlated across field environments, but not significantly correlated between greenhouse and field.

TI  - Environmental and genetic influences on phenology and plant size in a perennial herb, Senecio integrifolius
PY  - 1991
AB  - Individual plants of the perennial herb Senecio integrifolius showed a highly significant correlation between rank order of the dates of first flowering and of first fruiting in a natural population and in cultivation. Plants exposed to full sunshine were smaller and flowered earlier than shaded plants both in a natural population and in cultivation. Within the two groups, plants with large inflorescences started to flower first. Duration of flowering was regulated by the size of the inflorescence; plants with many heads flowered longer than plants with few heads. There was a significant correlation between phenological rank order of mother plants in natural populations and their progenies in cultivation, but no consistent relationship between mother size and progeny size was found. Cultivated plants were consistent in rank order of flowering and in size over the years. Key words: flowering phenology, plant size, genetic variation, Senecio.

PY  - 1992
AB  - Prostrate ecotypes of the species Ulex europaeus and Ulex gallii occurring in coastal heathlands of Brittany, France frequently exhibit irregularities during meiosis that lead to partial or total male sterility. Microsporogenesis in prostrate individuals grown in an experimental garden located far from the coast appears to be normal. Their fertility is also higher, as shown by counts made on seeds and pods. Comparison of plants growing in both places suggests that the low level of fertility may be due to environmental factors like drought or salinity. On the other hand, there is no correlation between the prostrate habit and the impairment of microsporogenesis under stress. Key words: water stress, microsporogenesis, Ulex, coastal heathlands.

TI  - Antagonistic pleiotropy, dominance and genetic variation
PY  - 1982
AB  - Although the importance of antagonistic pleiotropy of genes affecting components of fitness has long been argued, explicit population genetic models involving pleiotropy have only recently been developed. Simple, deterministic models of this kind are given, and then analyzed for conditions sufficient for protected polymorphism. It is found that dominance in gene action plays a key role in fostering the establishment of polymorphism in these models. However, the genetic variance for individual fitness components generally remains predominantly additive in spite of this. Though these models are not very robust, they do illustrate in principle one means of explaining recent experimental findings concerning the quantitative genetics of components of fitness in populations free of inbreeding.

TI  - Seasonal and geographic variation in the predation of gorse seed, Ulex europaeus L., by the seed weevil Apion ulicis Forst
PY  - 1991
AB  - AbstractGorse seed weevil, Apion ulicis Forst., was released into New Zealand in 1931 to help control gorse, Ulex europaeus L. This study examines the effect of the weevil in reducing annual seed production of gorse at three sites over 3 years. Weevils oviposited only during spring, and infested up to 90% of immature pods during that period. However, the many pods produced both earlier and later than this escaped attack. Lack of synchrony between weevil reproductive activity and gorse pod production limits the impact of the weevil on the annual gorse seed crop. Better adapted populations of Apion ulicis may exist in southern Europe and these could be introduced to increase predation on seed.

TI  - The evolution of trade-offs: where are we?
PY  - 2006
AB  - Trade-offs are a core component of many evolutionary models, particularly those dealing with the evolution of life histories. In the present paper, we identify four topics of key importance for studies of the evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we consider the underlying concept of 'constraint'. We conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely and suggest that 'constraint' in the sense of a bias should be clearly distinguished from 'constraint' in the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the utility of the acquisition-allocation model (the 'Y-model'). We find that, whereas this model and its derivatives have provided new insights, a misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under directional selection. A quantitative genetic model predicts that, under weak or short-term selection, the intercept will change but the slope will remain constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction but these are based on comparisons of geographic populations: more direct tests will come from artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at present little attention has been given to this question. We distinguish between phenotypic and genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors deserving investigation are mutation-selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it provides a rich ground for further study and the integration of many disciplines, including the emerging field of genomics.

TI  - Time after time: flowering phenology and biotic interactions
PY  - 2007
AB  - The role of biotic interactions in shaping plant flowering phenology has long been controversial; plastic responses to the abiotic environment, limited precision of biological clocks and inconsistency of selection pressures have generally been emphasized to explain phenological variation. However, part of this variation is heritable and selection analyses show that biotic interactions can modulate selection on flowering phenology. Our review of the literature indicates that pollinators tend to favour peak or earlier flowering, whereas pre-dispersal seed predators tend to favour off-peak or later flowering. However, effects strongly vary among study systems. To understand such variation, future studies should address the impact of mutualist and antagonist dispersal ability, ecological specialization, and habitat and plant population characteristics. Here, we outline future directions to study how such interactions shape flowering phenology.

TI  - Genetic variation in host susceptibility to attack by the mahogany shoot borer, Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller)
PY  - 1999
AB  - Summary

1 Attack by shoot borers (Hypsipyla grandella Zeller) is the main factor limiting the cultivation of Cedrela odorata and Swietenia macrophylla, two economically important members of the mahogany family. No viable methods of pest control are currently available. To assess for genetic variation in susceptibility to pest attack, a combined progeny/provenance test of C. odorata and a provenance test of S. macrophylla were established separately at CATIE, Turrialba, Costa Rica, and assessed intensively over an 84-week period.



2 Variation in height growth between provenances was highly significant in both species, provenance means varying by a factor of 2.7 and 1.2 in C. odorata and S. macrophylla, respectively. Cedrela odorata also displayed provenance variation in foliar phenology, as 94.7% of the trees from a ‘wet zone’ provenance remained foliated, whereas > 35% of trees from three ‘dry zone’ provenances abscised their leaves during the dry season.



3 Both species displayed significant genetic variation in susceptibility to shoot borer attack. At the peak of attack during the second year of growth, the effect of provenance was highly significant in both species, the mean number of attacks per tree varying between 0.8–2.4 and 0.6–1.3 in different provenances of C. odorata and S. macrophylla, respectively. A provenance of C. odorata from San Carlos, Costa Rica, displayed consistently lower susceptibility to pest attack, being subjected to fewer attacks during the first year and demonstrating a higher mean height to first point of damage.



4 The nitrogen, total tannin and proanthocyanidin concentration of foliage varied significantly between C. odorata provenances: nitrogen concentration was significantly lower and tannin and proanthocyanidin contents were significantly higher in trees from the San Carlos provenance, Costa Rica. This study therefore suggests that proanthocyanidins may reduce susceptibility of C. odorata to H. grandella, at least during the early period of growth.



5 These results provide support for the development of plant resistance as a strategy for managing shoot borers. In particular, there may be scope for selecting for high foliar proanthocyanidin content and the ability to tolerate attack by vigorous apical growth.

TI  - Correlational selection and the evolution of genomic architecture
PY  - 2002
AB  - We review and discuss the importance of correlational selection (selection for optimal character combinations) in natural populations. If two or more traits subject to multivariate selection are heritable, correlational selection builds favourable genetic correlations through the formation of linkage disequilibrium at underlying loci governing the traits. However, linkage disequilibria built up by correlational selection are expected to decay rapidly (ie, within a few generations), unless correlational selection is strong and chronic. We argue that frequency-dependent biotic interactions that have 'Red Queen dynamics' (eg, host-parasite interactions, predator-prey relationships or intraspecific arms races) often fuel chronic correlational selection, which is strong enough to maintain adaptive genetic correlations of the kind we describe. We illustrate these processes and phenomena using empirical examples from various plant and animal systems, including our own recent work on the evolutionary dynamics of a heritable throat colour polymorphism in the side-blotched lizard Uta stansburiana. In particular, male and female colour morphs of side-blotched lizards cycle on five- and two-generation (year) timescales under the force of strong frequency-dependent selection. Each morph refines the other morph in a Red Queen dynamic. Strong correlational selection gradients among life history, immunological and morphological traits shape the genetic correlations of the side-blotched lizard polymorphism. We discuss the broader evolutionary consequences of the buildup of co-adapted trait complexes within species, such as the implications for speciation processes.

TI  - EFFECTS OF POLLINATORS, HERBIVORES, AND SEED PREDATORS ON FLOWERING PHENOLOGY
PY  - 1997
AB  - The evolution of flowering phenology has most often been examined in light of one set of organisms, namely pollinators. However, the patterns of flowering phenology observed in nature are likely to reflect evolutionary compromises in response to a variety of selective forces. Two of the most important potentially opposing selective forces that could elicit such a compromise are pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators. Using a case study from my own work on the pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators of two members of the Polemoniaceae, Polemonium foliosissimum and Ipomopsis aggregata, I show that the outcome of selective pressures is not always predictable by examining one group of organisms or another. In addition, the outcome of separate and combined selective pressures is variable among years. Thus I show that only by considering all organisms that affect the fitness of a plant may we gain a complete understanding of the evolution of floral traits. I argue that we must account for both geographical and temporal variation in assessing the ecological and evolutionary importance of interacting organisms.

TI  - Nitrogen-richness and protection of seeds in Australian tropical rainforest: a test of plant defence theory
PY  - 1998
AB  - Some species invest more in protecting their seeds or embryos than others, yet the reasons behind this disparity have not been clearly identified. In order to test the hypotheses that species with marked protection in the fruit have high nitrogen concentration ([N]) in the seeds, and species with marked protection in the seeds have high [N] in the embryo-cum-endosperm fraction (EE), we determined the [N] in the seeds and EE of 194 species from lowland tropical rainforest in NE Queensland. For species in which the fruit provides marked protection of the seed there is a significant negative linear relationship between [N] and log seed mass. There is a similar relationship for 'unprotected' species, but the intercept on the y-axis is significantly and markedly higher for the group of'protected' species. This relationship holds true when genera rather than species are considered. We are also able to make taxonomically controlled comparisons within six families and within four genera: all six familial comparisons and two of the generic comparisons support the finding for the collection of species as a whole. We then compare the [N] in the EE of species in which the fruit does not offer marked protection, but in which there is a range of investment in the seed wall fraction. Species with > 60% dry mass in the wall have significantly higher [N] than species with less massive walls. Possible advantages of having nitrogen-rich seeds are discussed.

TI  - The ecology of seed dispersal by small rodents: a role for predator and conspecific scents
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Seed-caching rodents play a key role in the ecology of seed dispersal by not only consuming but also dispersing seeds. Rodent foraging behaviour is usually framed within optimal models, which predict that their decisions should maximize food intake and minimize foraging costs. Although predation risk and seed pilferage by conspecifics have been envisaged as two potential costs, their relevance for seed-caching behaviour and seed dispersal has barely been addressed. 2. To test the effect of predation and pilferage risk on the patterns of seed predation/dispersal by rodents, we performed a field experiment using a tri-trophic-level model (plant–mice–carnivore; Quercus spp-Apodemus sylvaticus-Genetta genetta) and the scents of the predator and conspecifics as direct cues. The behaviour of mice was analysed with video cameras set for continuous recording on consecutive nights, and we used tagged acorns to assess the patterns of acorn predation and dispersal. 3. Our results revealed that rodents were able to discriminate between the scents of genet and conspecifics and modified their seed dispersal behaviour accordingly. Mice spent more time ‘sniffing’ in rodent cages than in genet cages, where they displayed more ‘vigilance and freezing’ behaviours. In sites with mice scents, acorns were dispersed at shorter distances and were less predated. Conversely, in sites with genet scents acorn removal was delayed. 4. These results show that chemosensory information on predators and conspecifics influences the foraging decisions of seed-caching rodents over short spatial and temporal scales. This might entail cascading effects on the regeneration of plants. In sites where rodents perceive the risk of predation, inefficient foraging behaviour may result in less successful seed dispersal. Conversely, the detection of conspecific scents may increase dispersal efficiency and seedling recruitment. 5. Ultimately, the relationships between two distant levels in trophic webs (plants–carnivores) appear intricate, since carnivores may affect seed dispersal by changing the foraging behaviour of their prey (the seed disperser). This indirect relationship should be considered as a new dimension of the ecology of seed dispersal by small rodents.

TI  - Evolutionary advantages of mast seeding in Fagus crenata
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary


1
Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolutionary advantages of mast seeding (the intermittent production of large crops of flowers or seeds by a population of perennial plants). Mast seeding could have evolved as a result of increased pollination efficiency in mast-flowering years and/or as an anti-predator adaptation that increases the survival of seeds by alternately starving seed predators in non-mast years and satiating them in mast years.

2
We investigated annual seed crops to test the relative contributions of pollination efficiency and pre-dispersal predator satiation to mast seeding in Fagus crenata, a tall tree species dominating cool-temperate forests in Japan. Thirteen-year (1990–2002) time series data were collected for five beech forests in south-western Hokkaido.

3
The negative relationship observed between the pollination failure rate and the total seed crop in the current year supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The predator satiation hypothesis was also supported by the fact that the predation rate showed a good fit to the ratio of successive total seed crops, suggesting that a numerical response (starving the predator in low seed years) operated in F. crenata.

4
Key-factor analysis revealed that pre-dispersal seed predation had a larger effect on seed production per flower than did pollination efficiency.

5
We used a simulation model to examine how the magnitude of fluctuation in the total seed crop would influence the pollination failure rate, the predation rate and the viable seed rate. The mean levels of fluctuation of total seed crops of F. crenata were just large enough to provide maximum benefits from predator satiation at some sites.

6
Mast seeding in F. crenata thus appears to be determined by selective pressures from its seed predators.

TI  - Of mast and mean: differential-temperature cue makes mast seeding insensitive to climate change
PY  - 2012
AB  - Mast-seeding plants often produce high seed crops the year after a warm spring or summer, but the warm-temperature model has inconsistent predictive ability. Here, we show for 26 long-term data sets from five plant families that the temperature difference between the two previous summers (ΔT) better predicts seed crops. This discovery explains how masting species tailor their flowering patterns to sites across altitudinal temperature gradients; predicts that masting will be unaffected by increasing mean temperatures under climate change; improves prediction of impacts on seed consumers; demonstrates that strongly masting species are hypersensitive to climate; explains the rarity of consecutive high-seed years without invoking resource constraints; and generates hypotheses about physiological mechanisms in plants and insect seed predators. For plants, ΔT has many attributes of an ideal cue. This temperature-difference model clarifies our understanding of mast seeding under environmental change, and could also be applied to other cues, such as rainfall.

TI  - Positive cascade effects of forest fragmentation on acorn weevils mediated by seed size enlargement
PY  - 2011
AB  - .  1. Today, forest fragmentation is one of the major threats to biodiversity worldwide. In this context, fragmented populations of specialised forest organisms face an increasing risk of extinction because of factors such as local food scarcity. Nonetheless, the role of food availability may differ depending on organism size, which is expected to determine the energy requirements and mobility between fragments.



2. A field study was carried out on Curculio elephas, a forest beetle with low dispersal potential, whose larval development takes place in oak Quercus spp. acorns.



3. For a similar seed crop per tree, acorn size was larger in isolated oaks than in trees located in forest patches. Thus, fragmentation increased local food availability for C. elephas. Larger acorns enabled larval size to increase, a key fitness proxy associated with individual survival, adult size, and potential female fecundity. Indeed, the number of both adults and larvae was higher in isolated trees than in forest patches.



4. In the current scenario of increasing forest fragmentation, the survival likelihood of specialist insects may strongly depend on their ability to adapt to altered environmental conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on how some forest insects may take advantage of fragmentation-mediated changes to survive in isolated trees.



5. From a conservation perspective, management policies should preserve isolated trees as a source of seeds and fauna for the natural regeneration of forest ecosystems after unproductive farmlands have been abandoned.

TI  - Masting and trophic cascades: interplay between rowan trees, apple fruit moth, and their parasitoid in southern Norway
PY  - 2004
AB  - We analyzed berry production in rowan, Sorbus aucuparia L., in southern Norway and examined the ramifying effects of rowan masting on the dynamics of the dominant seed predator and its parasitoid. The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella Zeller, is a pre-dispersal seed predator of rowan. The larva of the apple fruit moth rely on rowan berries, which in turn is attacked by the parasitoid wasp, Microgaster politus Marsh. We found classic masting in rowan: berry production varied across years (the mean coefficient of variation=1.02) and was spatially synchronized at large scale (the averaged correlation coefficient = 0.67). Berry production represented a two-year cycle in western but a three-year cycle in eastern Norway. The abundance of the moth and the parasitoid also varied across years and were spatially synchronized. The degree of spatial synchrony decreased and cyclicity became obscure with increasing trophic level. We attempted to assess two different components to the predator satiation, functional and numerical satiations, based on a simple population dynamics model. The observed pattern of seed predation testified that both of functional and numerical satiations were at work in this system. In a comparison at different locations, rowan trees with more variable berry production were more effective in reducing losses to the seed predator. The parasitoids also seemed to experience satiation through the fluctuation in their host abundance. These results show that rowan masting has an adaptive foundation, which impacts the dynamics of higher trophic levels.

TI  - Galls of the Temperate Forest of Southern South America: Argentina and Chile
PY  - 2014
AB  - South American temperate forests are of special conservation concern due to their highly endemic flora and fauna, and the occurrence of unique plant-animal interactions. Yet, knowledge regarding gall inducers diversity is limited although increasing rapidly in the last two decades. Here, we performed a review of the literature, supplemented with field collected data by the authors, in order to provide the most up to date knowledge of gall inducers’ diversity associated with native woody species of the temperate forest of Chile and Argentina. We present data for 90 morphospecies of galls associated with 39 host-plant species (21 genera, 15 families), spanning insects and arachnids of at least 6 orders and nematodes. Most of this richness is associated to the best surveyed host-plant genus, Nothofagus, with up to 43 morphospecies of galls in just 8 dominant tree species. Moreover, we provide evidence that gall species richness across all woody host-plant species decreases with elevation, probably driven by decreased temperature and number of available host-plant species. However, this overall trend vary among host plant species and scales of observation. Overall, the study of gall diversity and the biotic and abiotic factors that shape their distribution in these austral forests offer an exciting and fertile field for future research. Besides emphasizing the need for more in depth taxonomic and diversity studies of the gall fauna of these forests, we propose several future lines of research that promise to further elucidate our understanding of the evolution of plant-gall interactions in these forests.

TI  - The spatial scale of plant-animal interactions: effects of resource availability and habitat structure
PY  - 2011
AB  - Plant–animal interactions are crucial nodes in the structure of communities and pivotal drivers of ecosystem functioning. Much of this relevance may depend on how animals cope with plant resources at different spatial scales. However, little is known about how and why different interactions perform at different scales in the same environmental setting. In this study we assess the spatial scales at which two plant–animal interactions operate and disentangle the environmental factors (plant resource availability vs. habitat structure) underpinning these operational scales. We studied two interactions with opposite (mutualistic vs. antagonistic) ecological effects on fleshy-fruited trees, frugivory and seed dispersal by birds, and the later predation by rodents on bird-dispersed seeds. Employing a standardized sampling, we covered three temperate ecosystems hosting structurally similar plant–frugivore–seed predator systems: Cantabrian forest, Mediterranean shrubland, and Patagonian forest. We sampled habitat...

TI  - Effects of nitrogen deposition on reproduction in a masting tree: benefits of higher seed production are trumped by negative biotic interactions
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary
Relatively little is known about the effects of anthropogenic environmental changes on reproductive ecology of trees. Yet, recruitment is a primary determinant of the long-term dynamics of plant populations in changing environments.
We used the Long-Term Ecological Research site at Harvard Forest to evaluate the effects of chronic (over 25 years) nitrogen fertilization on reproductive ecology of red oaks (Quercus rubra).
Oaks growing in fertilized plots produced 4-9 times more acorns than control trees. However, nitrogen deposition simultaneously affected oaks’ biotic interactions. It increased pre-dispersal seed predation by insects (primarily weevils, Curculio spp.) on fertilized plots, most likely as the result of the disruption of predator satiation. In addition, infestation by weevils was more likely to result in embryo destruction in fertilized than in control acorns. Furthermore, the proportion of acorns dispersed and cached by rodents decreased on fertilized plots. Finally, germination of fertilized acorns was lower than control acorns, even after controlling for effects of weevils and rodents.
Inclusion of the altered biotic interactions reversed the final picture of the effects of long-term nitrogen fertilization on oak reproduction: the positive effects on acorn quantity were trumped by the nitrogen-mediated changes in biotic interactions.
Synthesis. Our results stress the importance of considering indirect effects and consumer interactions when evaluating effects of environmental change on plant population dynamics. Long-term nitrogen fertilization has a strong potential to decrease the recruitment of masting trees. Given the ubiquitous increase in the anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, processes similar to those found in our system might operate in others, resulting in a widespread alteration of trees’ recruitment dynamics.

TI  - Seed production and recruitment in primary and harvested Nothofagus pumilio forests: Influence of regional climate and years after cuttings
PY  - 2015
AB  - Aim of study : Harvesting proposals (e.g. variable retention) for Nothofagus pumilio forests are based on canopy opening, to increase recruitment and enhance seedling growth, by modifying light and soil moisture. Seed production and seedling recruitment will define the success of harvesting, where remnant forest structure are the main influence factors, as well as biotic and abiotic factors. The objective was to analyse seed production, seedling recruitment and recruitment efficiency in primary and harvested forests through variable retention along the first 10 years after harvesting, as well as the influence of regional climate. Area of study : The study were conducted in a pure Nothofagus pumilio forest located in centralTierra del Fuego (54o18’ S, 67o49’ W), where harvested stands with variable retention and unmanaged forests were sampled in long-term permanent plots. Material and methods : Data of forest regeneration plots were used (n=72) (2007 a 2014), and forest structure and seed production (2006 a 2013) were also measured. Regional climate was characterised for these years from satellite images (Sea Surface Temperature) and climate re-analysis models (rainfall and temperature of land surface). Main results : Harvesting modified forest structure; however, aggregated retention maintained some characteristics of the primary unmanaged forests. These changes influenced seed production and recruitment. Seed production and recruitment were related to crown cover and the amount of seed production; however, recruitment efficiency was not affected by harvesting. The studied variables significantly changed along the years after harvesting. Seed production and recruitment were also related to regional climate factors, where it was possible to explain their variations through temperature (e.g. summer temperature) and rainfall (e.g. winter rainfall) for the different retention types in harvested forests and the primary forests. Research highlights : Variable retention harvesting generated different micro-conditions that influence seed production and recruitment. These variables were related to canopy cover. However, recruitment efficiency was not affected by harvesting. Seed production and recruitment (primary forests and harvested stands) were related to regional climate factors and their variations can be explained from variables related to temperature and rainfall. Key words: regeneration; forest management; crown cover; regional climate; modelling; Tierra del Fuego.

TI  - Cumulative Effects on the Reproductive Output of Pistacia terebinthus (Anacardiaceae)
PY  - 1994
AB  - This study identifies the factors that influence the reproductive output (number of viable seeds dispersed) of Pistacia terebinthus (Anacardiaceae), examines the magnitude and variability of their effects, and considers how plant traits affect the relative importance of each factor in reducing reproductive potential. Pre-dispersal reproductive losses were measured in a total of 28 individuals from anthesis to seed dispersal. Post-dispersal seed predation was estimated as well by placing seeds in different locations and checking them periodically. A total of eight factors were found to reduce plant reproductive potential during the pre-dispersal phase. Ordered according to the importance of their effects these factors were: abortion of flowers and latent ovaries, abortion of seeds, fruit dryness (mainly caused by hemipterans that suck the fruit pulp), parthenocarpy (production of empty seeds), consumption of viable fruits by non-legitimate seed dispersers, fruit damage by psyllids, seed damage by chalcidoid wasps, and fruit damage by fungi. There was much inter-individual variability in the effects of all those factors. That variation, however, was in most cases independent of the plant traits examined (plant size, fecundity, distance to males, flowering synchrony, peak date of fruit ripening). The most relevant associations were found between plant fecundity and (1) proportion of wasp-damaged seeds (larger fruit crops experienced greater seed predation by these insects) and (2) proportion of fruits removed by non-legitimate seed dispersers (smaller fruit crops with greater proportions of viable seeds had higher bird predation rates). Also, plants that had most fruits ripen in early September had more viable seeds removed by non-legitimate dispersers than those that had most fruits ripen in late September. A key factor analysis showed that factors intrinsic to the plant, such as flower and ovary abortion and seed inviability, accounted for low among-plant variation in total reproductive losses, even though their relative contribution to such losses was great. Extrinsic factors such as fruit or seed damage by animals accounted for a low reproductive loss but for great among-plant variation in the number of viable seeds dispersed, and appeared to act as selective agents on plant fecundity. Post-dispersal seed predators (mainly field mice, chaffinches, and ants) removed a significant proportion of the seeds placed in different locations where birds can drop them, indicating that seedling recruitment in a given site is largely determined by the abundance of these animals at that site.

TI  - The interplay among acorn abundance and rodent behavior drives the spatial pattern of seedling recruitment in mature Mediterranean oak forests
PY  - 2015
AB  - The patterns of seedling recruitment in animal-dispersed plants result from the interactions among environmental and behavioral variables. However, we know little on the contribution and combined effect of both kinds of variables. We designed a field study to assess the interplay between environment (vegetation structure, seed abundance, rodent abundance) and behavior (seed dispersal and predation by rodents, and rooting by wild boars), and their contribution to the spatial patterns of seedling recruitment in a Mediterranean mixed-oak forest. In a spatially explicit design, we monitored intensively all environmental and behavioral variables in fixed points at a small spatial scale from autumn to spring, as well as seedling emergence and survival. Our results revealed that the spatial patterns of seedling emergence were strongly related to acorn availability on the ground, but not by a facilitationeffect of vegetation cover. Rodents changed seed shadows generated by mother trees by dispersing most seeds from shrubby to open areas, but the spatial patterns of acorn dispersal/predation had no direct effect on recruitment. By contrast, rodents had a strong impact on recruitment as pilferers of cached seeds. Rooting by wild boars also reduced recruitment by reducing seed abundance, but also by changing rodent’s behavior towards higher consumption of acorns in situ. Hence, seed abundance and the foraging behavior of scatter-hoarding rodents and wild boars are driving the spatial patterns of seedling recruitment in this mature oak forest, rather than vegetation features. The contribution of vegetation to seedling recruitment (e.g. facilitation by shrubs) may be context dependent, having a little role in closed forests, or being overridden by directed seed dispersal from shrubby to open areas. We warn about the need of using broad approaches that consider the combined action of environment and behavior to improve our knowledge on the dynamics of natural regeneration in forests.

TI  - Competing for seed dispersal: evidence for the role of avian seed hoarders in mediating apparent predation among oaks
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary
In communities of large-seeded tree species, generalist seed hoarders often link the temporally variable dynamics of various species in ways that can result in indirect ecological interactions. A special case of such interactions is “apparent predation” – when variation in seed production of one tree species changes the outcome of the interaction between seed hoarders and another tree species from seed dispersal mutualism to predation.
We investigated how two species of avian hoarders responded to differences in acorn availability among individual valley oaks (Quercus lobata) and across a landscape dominated by blue oaks (Q. douglasii) to determine whether seed dispersal and predation dynamics result in apparent predation between these oak species.
California scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica), high-quality seed dispersers with large spatial scales of resource perception, showed strong numerical and functional responses to individually large Q. lobata acorn crops when landscape-level acorn crops were low, but the numerical response was not observed when Q. douglasii produced a good acorn crop the subsequent year. In contrast, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), which are significant acorn predators, exhibited a consistent functional response to individual Q. lobata acorn crops independent of landscape-wide availability. Consequently, Q. lobata experienced increased predation and a near absence of high-quality seed dispersal when Q. douglasii acorns were abundant.
Our results suggest that apparent predation among oak species can arise from contrasting responses of generalist seed predators and dispersers to acorn availability on different spatial scales. Thus, the spatial scale of resource perception, which can differ greatly among generalist seed hoarders, may provide a proximate mechanism underlying indirect, temporally-variable ecological affects such as apparent predation among sympatric species of large-seeded trees.

TI  - Pre-dispersal acorn predation in mixed oak forests: interspecific differences are driven by the interplay among seed phenology, seed size and predator size
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary

1. Pre-dispersal seed predation (PSP) often occurs in multi-host–predator systems (e.g. several plant species exposed to a common array of granivorous insects). However, whether the interaction among seed phenology, seed size and predator size accounts for interspecific differences in PSP remains elusive.



2. We studied PSP in a mixed-oak forest with two oaks (the larger-seeded Quercus humilis and the smaller-seeded Q. ilex), both depredated by two acorn weevils (the smaller Curculio glandium and the larger C. elephas). We intensively monitored acorn production and infestation phenology and we identified the weevil species depredating acorns by means of DNA taxonomy.



3. The minimum acorn size required for infestation was lower for C. glandium than for C. elephas, in accordance with their different body sizes. This resulted in an earlier infestation phenology in C. glandium and the ability of this species to infest both smaller and larger acorns. Above a minimum acorn size threshold, no selection for larger acorns by weevils was observed.



4. Initial acorn crop size was similar in the two oaks. Nonetheless, the earlier acorn phenology and the production of larger acorns in Q. humilis favoured the earlier infestation by C. glandium and the predation by both small and large weevils. Smaller acorns of Q. ilex almost excluded infestation by the larger C. elephas.



5. Although larger acorns of Q. humilis could better survive infestation (preserve the embryo), higher PSP in this species finally resulted in a lower mature acorn crop size than in Q. ilex.



6. Synthesis. In a multi-host–predator system, smaller-seeded species may benefit from a reduced PSP because they exclude larger granivorous insects, but also by means of a ‘free-rider effect’, if larger-seeded heterospecifics earlier reach a critical size to be depredated. These results also highlight the benefits of a small body size in granivorous insects to depredate seeds earlier and to forage on a wider range of seed sizes. Whether the advantage of ‘being small’ in this antagonistic plant–animal interaction is offset by other processes, or whether it results in a pressure towards seed and insect size reduction, deserves further attention.

TI  - Increased drought reduces acorn production in Quercus ilex coppices: thinning mitigates this effect but only in the short term
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary In order to explore the effects of climate change on Mediterranean regenerating forests, we experimentally assessed the effects of increased drought on the reproductive attributes of Quercus ilex over a 4-year period (2005 – 2008). We also investigated whether traditional thinning (selection of one to a few stems per stump) could mitigate the consequences of increased drought in oak coppices. Increased drought reduced the number of reproductive trees, mean number of female fl owers produced and acorn crop size, although most of these effects appeared only in the last 2 years of the experiment. In a different way, thinning enhanced all reproductive attributes, but its main effects were transient and covered only 1 or 2 years after the application of the treatments. Our results indicate that a moderate reduction in rainfall (15 per cent ) reduces the reproductive ability of Q. ilex . This may have long-term negative consequences for recruitment as well as for the fauna feeding on acorns. Although traditional thinning may mitigate the consequences of increased drought, it has a remarkably short-term effect. This highlights the need to re-examine traditional forestry practices as potential adaptive strategies for coping with climate change in Mediterranean regenerating forests.

TI  - Modelos forzados y no forzados para el cálculo del índice de sitio en bosques de Nothofagus antarctica en Patagonia Sur
PY  - 2011
AB  - El potencial de produccion de un rodal puede definirse a traves de la calidad de sitio. Una forma de medir dicha calidad es a traves de ecuaciones de indice de sitio, existiendo distintos tipos de ecuaciones (forzadas y no forzadas). El objetivo fue comparar el ajuste de diferentes ecuaciones de indice de sitio con diferentes edades base mediante validaciones a lo largo de gradientes de edad y clase de sitio en bosques de Nothofagus antarctica de Patagonia Sur. Se ajustaron cuatro ecuaciones de crecimiento en altura, dos no forzadas y dos forzadas. Las edades base utilizadas para el ajuste fueron 30, 40 y 50 anos. Se realizaron autovalidaciones de las ecuaciones a lo largo de gradientes de edad y de calidad de sitio. Los menores errores se obtuvieron al utilizar una edad base de 50 anos para todas las ecuaciones. Los mejores ajustes en los gradientes de edad y calidad de sitio se obtuvieron con los modelos de Weibull, Richards y Newnham. Los valores provenientes de la autovalidacion de las ecuaciones seleccionadas fueron comparables a los encontrados por otros autores que trabajaron con curvas de indice de sitio aplicadas a bosques de Nothofagus spp. La ecuacion de Newnham fue la que mejor describio el crecimiento en altura dominante de N. antarctica, cumpliendo con las condiciones que deben tener las curvas de crecimiento. Estos resultados permiten senalar que el modelo es recomendable para ser usado como una herramienta de prediccion en la planificacion del manejo de los bosques de N. Antarctica.

TI  - Evidence for insect seed predator dynamics mediated by vertebrate frugivores
PY  - 2013
AB  - Se ha sugerido que los vertebrados frugivoros reducen la depredacion de semillas, al controlar indirectamente las poblaciones de insectos depredadores de semillas (IDS) por medio del consumo de muchos individuos cuando se alimentan de los frutos. No obstante, no se ha explorado la posibilidad de que esta 'depredacion frugivora' pueda afectar diferencialmente a los IDS de acuerdo a diferencias especificas en el tiempo de desarrollo larval dentro del fruto. En las especies del bosque seco tropical Acacia pennatula y Guazuma ulmifolia comparamos la depredacion de semillas y las abundancias absolutas y relativas de las especies de escarabajos bruquidos (Bruchinae) en dos sitios, uno con grandes frugivoros (ganado) y el otro libre de ganado por un tiempo considerable. En el sitio con ganado encontramos una notable reduccion general en la proporcion de semillas depredadas (ca. 15 %) respecto al sitio sin ganado, y cambios en la comunidad de IDS, en particular una reduccion en la abundancia absoluta y relativa de la especie de bruquido con el tiempo de desarrollo larval mas largo. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la interaccion entre procesos evolutivos (resultantes en variaciones de las historias de vida de los insectos) y las complejas interacciones ecologicas (consumo inadvertido por grandes animales) puede contribuir a la coexistencia de distintas especies de insectos alimentandose de la misma planta huesped.

TI  - Empty seeds are not always bad: simultaneous effect of seed emptiness and masting on animal seed predation.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Seed masting and production of empty seeds have often been considered independently as different strategies to reduce seed predation by animals. Here, we integrate both phenomena within the whole assemblage of seed predators (both pre and post-dispersal) and in two contrasting microsites (open vs. sheltered) to improve our understanding of the factors controlling seed predation in a wind-dispersed tree (Ulmus laevis). In years with larger crop sizes more avian seed predators were attracted with an increase in the proportion of full seeds predated on the ground. However, for abundant crops, the presence of empty seeds decreased the proportion of full seeds predated. Empty seeds remained for a very long period in the tree, making location of full seeds more difficult for pre-dispersal predators and expanding the overall seed drop period at a very low cost (in dry biomass and allocation of C, N and P). Parthenocarpy (non-fertilized seeds) was the main cause of seed emptiness whereas seed abortion was produced in low quantity. These aborted seeds fell prematurely and, thus, could not work as deceptive seeds. A proportion of 50% empty seeds significantly reduced ground seed predation by 26%. However, a high rate of parthenocarpy (beyond 50% empty seeds) did not significantly reduce seed predation in comparison to 50% empty seeds. We also found a high variability and unpredictability in the production of empty seeds, both at tree and population level, making predator deception more effective. Open areas were especially important to facilitate seed survival since rodents (the main post-dispersal predators) consumed seeds mostly under shrub cover. In elm trees parthenocarpy is a common event that might work as an adaptive strategy to reduce seed predation. Masting per se did not apparently reduce the overall proportion of seeds predated in this wind-dispersed tree, but kept great numbers of seeds unconsumed.

TI  - Anticipation and tracking of pulsed resources drive population dynamics in eastern chipmunks
PY  - 2011
AB  - Pulsed systems are characterized by boom and bust cycles of resource production that are expected to cascade through multiple trophic levels. Many of the consumers within pulsed resource systems have specific adaptations to cope with these cycles that may serve to either amplify or dampen their community-wide consequences. We monitored a seed predator, the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), in an American beech (Fagus grandifolia) dominated forest, and used capture–mark–recapture analyses to estimate chipmunk vital rates and relate them to interannual variation in beech seed production. The summer activity and reproduction of adults anticipated autumn beech production, with high activity and intense reproduction occurring in summers prior to beech masts. Chipmunks also reproduced every spring following a beech mast. However, adult survival was independent of beech production. In contrast, juvenile survival was lower in years of mast failure than in years of mast production, but their activity was consist...

TI  - Impact of insect herbivores on competition between birds and mammals for pinyon pine seeds
PY  - 1993
AB  - Few studies have considered impacts of insect cone herbivores on bird and mammal seed consumers. Harvests of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) cones by insects, birds, and mammals were negatively correlated both within and across sites. Birds and mammals significantly increased their cone harvest when the other group was experimentally pre- vented access to trees, and mammals harvested more cones when insects were removed from trees with an insecticide. These results suggest that stem- and cone-boring insects (primarily Dioryctria albovittella), birds (Clark's Nutcrackers, Pinyon Jays, and Scrub Jays), and mammals (cliff chipmunks and rock squirrels) compete for pinyon pine seeds. Addi- tionally, insects affected the interaction between birds and mammals because the ratio of mammal to bird harvest increased up to 350-fold as insect cone consumption increased. Because insect-infested and uninfested pinyon pines are genetically different, these obser- vations and experiments suggest that genetic interactions between plants and herbivores can affect the structure of a seed-consumer community.

TI  - Consumption of Larvae by the Austral Parakeet (Enicognathus ferrugineus)
PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract We report observations of the Austral Parakeet (Enicognathus ferrugineus) feeding on larvae in the northern part of its distribution in the austral temperate forests of Argentine Patagonia during the pre- and post-reproductive seasons. Larvae consumed were Aditrochus fagicolus (Chalcidoidea: Pteromalidae) in leaf galls of Nothofagus pumilio (79 observations), larvae from Homoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera in seed galls of N. pumilio (12 observations), and larval Nemonychidae (Coleoptera) in male cones of Araucaria araucana (69 observations). Our observations suggest Enicognathus ferrugineus could be more insectivorous than previously thought, perhaps to help meet their demand for high-quality food during the pre- and post-reproductive seasons.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in tree seed production and dispersal in a New Zealand temperate rainforest
PY  - 2014
AB  - Spatial and temporal variation in tree seed production is an important driver of the population dynamics of trees and of mammalian and avian seed consumers. Many studies have documented strong synchrony in production of intermittent large tree seed crops (masting), with cascading effects on the food webs of seed consumers and their predators. We used inverse modeling to characterize spatial and temporal variation in seed production and dispersal by four dominant tree species (two angiosperms and two conifers) over 8 years in southern temperate rainforests of New Zealand. In contrast to expectations from masting theory, there was little evidence of synchrony across species in years of high seed production, and only weak evidence in support of the expectation that temporal variation in seed production within species was strongly bimodal. Contrary to expectation from allometric scaling rules, there was no increase in reproductive effort once tree size (DBH) exceeded a minimum threshold (22–29 cm DBH) in the two angiosperm species. In the conifers, the minimum estimated size threshold for seed production was much higher (42–56 cm DBH), and in one of the species increased faster than linearly with biomass above the threshold size, indicating that the very largest trees in the conifer populations dominated seed production. Of the two species that occurred commonly on both fertile alluvial sites and less fertile uplifted marine terraces, the angiosperm species had higher per capita seed production on the fertile sites, while the conifer had higher per capita seed production (during seed years) on the less fertile sites. Local seed rain from all four species declined steeply with increasing distance from a parent, with peak local dispersal within 6 m of parent trees. This is not surprising given that the species are predominately gravity or animal dispersed with poor adaptations for wind dispersal. A substantial fraction of the input of seeds of all four species could not be attributed to local parent trees, consistent with longer distance dispersal by animals.

Viable seed fall of yellow birch began in August and continued through autumn and winter. Most of the viable sugar maple seed fell during a short period in October. Beech seed fall occurred slightly later than sugar maple. Seed losses caused by pollination or fertilization failure, abortion, incomplete development, insects, small mammals, and birds averaged about 213 of the total seed fall, but varied widely among years.

TI  - Scatter-hoarding corvids as seed dispersers for oaks and pines: A review of a widely distributed mutualism and its utility to habitat restoration
PY  - 2016
AB  - ABSTRACT Seed dispersal mutualisms with scatter-hoarders play a crucial role in population dynamics of temperate large-seeded trees. These behaviors shape seed dispersal patterns, which can be applied to conservation of populations, communities, and even ecosystems dominated by large-seeded trees. We draw on a growing body of literature to describe the ecological context and consequences of scatter-hoarding as a seed dispersal mechanism. We synthesize the quantitative literature on the interaction between members of the avian family Corvidae (crows, ravens, jays, magpies, and nutcrackers) and nut-bearing trees such as pines (Pinus spp.) and oaks (Quercus spp.) to examine unique aspects of avian scatter-hoarders as seed dispersers. During the scatter-hoarding process, seed selectivity, transportation distance, hoarding frequency, and cache placement affect seed dispersal effectiveness, a measure of the quantity and quality of dispersal. Case studies from around the world highlight the role of corvid seed d...

The primary predispersal seed predators of H. courbaril in Costa Rica, Rhinochenus spp., are absent from Puerto Rico, and it is postulated that this is a major cause of the interpopulation differences.

TI  - Dispersal Distance and Burial Mode of Acorns in Eurasian Jays Garrulus glandarius in European Temperate Forests
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dispersal distance and burial mode of acorns are two of the most important characteristics in renewal processes of oaks that result from the food hoarding ecology of the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius. To obtain the dispersal distance and to locate precisely the caches with scattered acorns we used radio-tracked transmitters with flexible 13 cm long sticking out antennae injected into drilled acorns. From mid-September to mid-October acorns of Pedunculate Oak Quercus robur with transmitters were mixed with untagged acorns and exhibited on five feeders distributed from each other at a distance of at least 1.3 km (max. 3.8). We obtained information on 121 tagged acorns scattered by Jays in two consecutive years (2014 — 42 records, 2015 — 79 records). For both seasons, mean dispersal distance was 115.7 metres (SE = 9.2). The maximum detected distance was 456 m, the minimum was 3 m. Most of the acorns (52.6%) were deposited by Jays up to 100 m from the source. Dispersal distance differed significantly between the two years of research and between feeders. Mean dispersal distance was much higher in 2014 (166 m, N = 42) than in 2015 (86 m, N = 72) and differed between seasons while the seed crop was similar and low. Only four acorns (3.5%) were found on the litter with no signs of hiding, which suggests accidental loss during transport (dyszoochory). Most of the cached acorns (44.6%) were deposited in the Scots Pine Pinus silvestris litter or moss cushions no deeper than 0.5 cm. The additional covering of caches with pieces of bark or leaves were noted accidentally in nine cases (9.8%).

TI  - Seasonal patterns of food storing in the Jay Garrulus glandarius
PY  - 1996
AB  - This study investigated seasonal patterns in food consumption and food storage in six captive Jays Garrulus glandarius. In the first experiment, seasonal changes in food-storing intensity were tested by presenting acorns (oak seeds, Quercus spp.) in spring, summer and autumn. There were no significant differences between the seasons in the amount of food eaten. However, significantly more food was taken and stored in the autumn than in the spring and summer months. In the spring and summer, the acorns were stored between the doorframes, on the ledges of the aviaries and under the bark of branches. In the autumn, Jays also began to hoard underneath the plastic sheeting covering the hard-board flooring by ripping the polythene to create a hidden cache site. The length of time over which the stored food was left before retrieval increased from summer to autumn. Food storing also occurred in spring and summer but was short term. The second experiment tested whether or not there were seasonal changes in food preference by presenting birds with acorns, peanuts and mealworms in the summer and autumn. More peanuts were eaten, taken and stored in the autumn than in the summer, and, as in the first experiment, significantly more acorns were taken and stored in the autumn. In the autumn, only a few mealworms were eaten before the birds stored acorns and peanuts, whereas in the summer, birds tended to eat most of the mealworms before they began to store. As in the first experiment, items tended to be buried in the ground in the autumn and left for longer periods before retrieval. These results are discussed in relation to the demand that each food type places on the Jay's time.

TI  - Increasing spring temperatures favor oak seed production in temperate areas.
PY  - 2017
AB  - The changes in reproductive phenology (i.e. timing of flowering and fruiting) observed in recent decades demonstrate that tree reproduction has already been altered by climate change. However, understanding the impact of these changes in reproductive success and fitness remains a major challenge for ecologists. We describe here a previously unreported phenomenon: a significant increase in the reproductive effort (seed production) of temperate oaks with increasing spring temperature, observed over the last decade. In contrast, no relationship was found between seed production and precipitation. This sensitivity of seed production to temperature was confirmed by a "space-for-time" substitution based on elevation gradients. Our findings suggest that global warming may enhance oak reproductive effort in temperate ecosystems. Nevertheless, while fitness can be enhanced by higher levels of seed production, it also depends on the frequency and synchronization of mast seeding production, which may also be influenced by climate change.

TI  - Effective nut dispersal by magpies (Pica pica L.) in a Mediterranean agroecosystem
PY  - 2017
AB  - Scatter-hoarding animals such as corvids play a crucial role in the dispersal of nut-producing tree species. This interaction is well known for some corvids, but remains elusive for other species such as the magpie (Pica pica), an abundant corvid in agroecosystems and open landscapes of the Palearctic region. In addition, the establishment of the individual dispersed seeds—a prerequisite for determining seed-dispersal effectiveness—has never before been documented for the interaction between corvids and nut-producing trees. We analyzed walnut dispersal by magpies in an agroecosystem in southern Spain. We used several complementary approaches, including video recording nut removal from feeders, measuring dispersal distance using radio tracking (with radio transmitters placed inside nuts), and monitoring the fate of dispersed nuts to the time of seedling emergence. Magpies were shown to be highly active nut dispersers. The dispersal distance averaged 39.6 ± 4.5 m and ranged from 4.1 to 158.5 m. Some 90% of the removed walnuts were cached later, and most of these (98%) were buried in the soil or hidden under plant material. By the time of seedling emergence, ca. 33% of nuts remained at the caching location. Finally, 12% of the cached nuts germinated and 4% yielded an emerged seedling, facilitating the transition to the next regeneration stage. The results demonstrate for the first time that magpies can be an effective scatter-hoarding disperser of a nut-producing tree species, suggesting that this bird species may play a key role in the regeneration and expansion of broadleaf forests in Eurasia.

TI  - Mast pulses shape trophic interactions between fluctuating rodent populations in a primeval forest.
PY  - 2012
AB  - How different functional responses of consumers exploiting pulsed resources affect community dynamics is an ongoing question in ecology. Tree masting is a common resource pulse in terrestrial ecosystems that can drive rodent population cycles. Using stable isotope (δ13C, δ15N) analyses, we investigated the dietary response of two fluctuating rodent species, the yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and the bank vole Myodes glareolus, to mast events in Bialowieza Forest (NE Poland). Rodent hair samples were obtained non-invasively from faeces of their predators for an 11-year period that encompassed two mast events. Spectacular seed crops of deciduous trees, namely oak Quercus robur and hornbeam Carpinus betulus, occur after several intermediate years of moderate seed production, with a post-mast year characterised by a nil crop. While a Bayesian isotopic (SIAR) mixing model showed a variety of potential vegetation inputs to rodent diets, the isotopic niche of the yellow-necked mouse was strongly associated with mast of deciduous trees (>80% of diet), showing no variation among years of different seed crop. However, bank voles showed a strong functional response; in mast years the vole shifted its diet from herbs in deciduous forest (~66% of diet) to mast (~74%). Only in mast years did the isotopic niche of both rodent species overlap. Previous research showed that bank voles, subordinate and more generalist than mice, showed higher fluctuations in numbers in response to masting. This study provides unique data on the functional response of key pulse consumers in forest food webs, and contributes to our understanding of rodent population fluctuations and the mechanisms governing pulse–consumer interactions.

TI  - Masting in wind-pollinated trees: system-specific roles of weather and pollination dynamics in driving seed production
PY  - 2017
AB  - Masting, the highly variable production of synchronized large seed crops, is a common reproductive strategy in plant populations. In wind-pollinated trees, flowering and pollination dynamics are hypothesized to provide the mechanistic link for the well-known relationship between weather and population-level seed production. Several hypotheses make predictions about the effect of weather on annual pollination success. The pollen coupling hypothesis predicts that weather and plant resources drive the flowering effort of trees which directly translates into the size of seed crops through efficient pollination. In contrast, the pollination Moran effect hypothesis predicts that weather affects pollination efficiency, leading to occasional bumper crops. Furthermore, the recently formulated phenology synchrony hypothesis predicts that Moran effects can arise because of weather effects on flowering synchrony, which, in turn, drives pollination efficiency. We investigated the relationship between weather, airborne pollen, and seed production in common European trees, two oak species (Quercus petraea and Q. robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) with a 19-year data set from three sites in Poland. Our results show that warm summers preceding flowering correlated with high pollen abundance and warm springs resulted in short pollen seasons (i.e. high flowering synchrony) for all three species. Pollen abundance was the best predictor for seed crops in beech, as predicted under pollen coupling. In oaks, short pollen seasons, rather than pollen abundance, correlated with large seed crops, providing support for the pollination Moran effect and phenology synchrony hypotheses. Fundamentally different mechanisms may therefore drive masting in species of the family Fagacae.

TI  - Dispersal of Whitebark Pine Seeds by Clark's Nutcracker: A Mutualism Hypothesis
PY  - 1982
AB  - (1) Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) store a mean of only 3.7 whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seeds per cache, which reduces competition for moisture and space. The mean depth at which seeds are stored, 2.0 cm, is compatible with germination requirements, and many sites selected appear suitable for seed germination. (2) One nutcracker stores about 32 000 whitebark pine seeds at subalpine elevations each year, which represent 3-5 times its energetic requirements. Although parent nutcrackers feed stored seeds to juveniles, in some years there is probably an excess of seeds stored by the population as a whole. (3) Experimental results suggest that seeds retrieved from nutcracker caches are as viable as seeds extracted by hand from cones and that seedlings originating in nutcracker caches have a good survival rate: 56% over the first year and 25% by the fourth year. (4) In comparison with Clark's nutcracker, alternative disperal agents, i.e. rodents and cone disintegration, disperse fewer seeds, disperse seeds shorter distances from parent trees, place seeds in sites less suitable for germination, and/or make large seed caches which lower reproductive potential. Nutcrackers disseminate seeds throughout the subalpine habitat and are, in part, responsible for the 'pioneering' status of whitebark pine. (5) The evolution of wingless seeds and indehiscent cones in the Cembra pine group was probably a consequence of seed dispersal by an ancestral nutcracker form. It appears that the Clark's nutcracker-whitebark pine interaction is both coevolved and mutualistic.

TI  - Costs of reproduction: an evaluation of the empirical evidence
PY  - 1985
AB  - Theoretical studies of life history evolution almost unanimously incorporate some form of tradeoff between life history variables, such as reduced parental survival due to increased reproductive effort. These tradeoffs, or costs of reproduction, are fundamental in predicting the optimal life history in any given environment. The importance of such costs in theoretical models has motivated researchers to check that they exist by seeking an association between some component of reproductive effort, such as fecundity, and some form of cost, such as parental survival. Four methods have been used for making these evaluations: 1) Phenotypic correlations, where some index of reproductive effort is correlated with a potential cost, 2) Experimental manipulations, where reproduction is directly manipulated and a cost-related response is measured, 3) Genetic correlations, where formal quantitative genetic designs are used to estimate the genetic correlation between some component of reproductive effort and some component of cost, and 4) Correlated responses to selection, where artificial selection causes correlated changes in reproductive effort and some component of costs. Because the theoretical studies are models of evolution, I argue that a relevant empirical study must deal with genetically based tradeoffs. By this criterion, only the last two methods (which represent a small minority of the reviewed studies) properly address the "costs" dealt with by theoreticians; however, this evaluation is not intended as a litmus test for the merits of a given approach to the problem. I discuss both the important contributions of the first two methods to our understanding of the costs of reproduction and the limitations of the last two methods in assessing "costs".

TI  - Ecophysiology of the internal cycling of nitrogen for tree growth
PY  - 1996
AB  - Internal cycling of nitrogen has been shown to be a major source of nitrogen used for the seasonal growth of both evergreen and deciduous trees providing up to 90% of N used for leaf growth of some species. The processes of internal cycling comprise seasonal nitrogen storage, followed by remobilisation during either periods of growth (e.g. in the spring) or during leaf senescence. The ecophysiology of these processes is reviewed, along with the methods used to quantify their contribution to tree growth.

Nitrogen budget studies have been widely used to estimate internal cycling, particularly in relation to soil fertility. These studies have shown that as trees develop their rate of N uptake decreases, but as they grow their storage capacity increases, However, budget studies are imprecise and have not always quantified remobilisation adequately. An alternative approach has been the use of 15N to quantify N uptake and partitioning, allowing precise measurements of N storage and remobilisation to be made. The use of isotopes has allowed experiments to be run which have shown that environmental factors such as soil fertility influence the amount of N stored, but have no direct influence upon the amount of N remobilised. These methods are discussed in light of recent research on N remobilisation, which has provided an understanding of the processes of storage and remobilisation which potentially allows direct measurements to be made in field grown trees for the first time.

TI  - Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves of perennials: are there general patterns?
PY  - 1996
AB  - 1 Possible patterns in nutrient resorption efficiency (% of the leaf nutrient pool resorbed) from senescing leaves of perennials were examined at both the intra- and the interspecific level. Most of the data used originated from studies with evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees. 2 Combining all data, mean nutrient resorption efficiency was 50% for N (n = 287) and 52% for P (n = 226). N resorption efficiency of evergreen shrubs and trees (47%) was significantly lower than in deciduous shrubs and trees (54%), whereas P resorption efficiency did not differ significantly between these growth-forms (51 and 50%, respectively). Although nutrient resorption is an important nutrient conservation mechanism at the species level, it does not differ strongly between growth-forms. 3 Mean N and P concentrations in leaves of deciduous shrubs and trees were about 60% higher than in evergreen species. There were only small differences in mean resorption efficiency and nutrient concentrations in leaf litter of deciduous species were therefore much higher than in evergreens. This implies that, in comparison with deciduous species, the low nutrient concentrations in mature leaves of evergreens contribute far more to nutrient conservation than does nutrient resorption. 4 Relations between leaf nutrient status and leaf nutrient resorption were absent or very weak. Assuming that leaf nutrient status reflects nutrient availability, this implies that nutrient resorption is only weakly controlled by nutrient availability. 5 At the intraspecific level, nutrient resorption was not very responsive to increased nutrient availability. There was no response in 63% of the experiments analysed (covering 60 spp.), whereas in 32% there was a decrease in N resorption in response to increased nutrient availability. For P (37 species analysed) there was no response in 57% of the cases and in 35% of the cases P resorption decreased upon enhanced nutrient supply. Evergreen shrubs and trees showed especially low responsiveness. 6 This review shows that there are no clear nutritional controls on nutrient resorption efficiency. Future research should focus on the biochemical basis of variation in nutrient resorption efficiency and on the factors, other than nutrient availability, that control nutrient resorption efficiency.

TI  - Quantitative estimates of uptake and internal cycling of 14N-labeled fertilizer in mature walnut trees
PY  - 1998
AB  - Summary Uptake and internal cycling of nitrogen (N) in mature walnut trees was studied over a period of 6 years using 15 N-depleted fertilizer and full-canopied walnut (Juglans regia L. cv Hartley) trees. The magnitude of internal N cycling, i.e., the availability of N for new growth from internal N pools, was quantified using both the percent annual depletion (PAD) and the N balance budget approaches. There was good agreement between the two measures, and about 60% of annual N demand was derived from N redistribution from internal pools. The remaining 40% of annual tree N demand was met by an influx of N from the soil/fertilizer pool. Trees were excavated, processed and analyzed after 6 years to determine total tree N content and labeled N recovery. Trees recovered 29.4% of the labeled N applied and, based on previous evidence, we as sumed that tree accumulation of labeled N occurred entirely in the first year. Labeled N in the fruits and leaves harvested in the first year represented 26% of the total labeled N accumulated, and the remaining 74% of the labeled N accumulated that year was stored and used to support development of annual organs in subsequent years. In the first year, the early maturing catkins did not accumulate labeled N, indicating their exclusive reliance on internal N. Using the atom% 14 N excess values of catkins and an exponential decline equation to determine turnover rate, the Mean Residence Time (MRT) of storage N in the tree was estimated to be 2.0 years. The size of the cycling pool of storage N in the tree was estimated to be about 50% of the total N content of perennial tree parts. Our data support the hypotheses that: (1) in any given year, mature walnut trees store the majority of soil and fertilizer N absorbed and within 2 years following uptake the N is remobilized and used for new growth, and (2) about half of the total N content of the perennial parts of mature walnut trees is present as nonstructural N and is available for recycling.

TI  - Variation in the masting of common beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.) in northern Europe over two centuries (1800–2001)
PY  - 2003
AB  - Records of beech masting for Germany, Denmark, The Netherlands, England and Sweden over the past two centuries have been collected from published research. They have been converted to a common five-point scale to permit comparison between masting in different countries and different years. Very good masts occurred in both Germany and Denmark in 1888, 1909 and 1918. Good/very good masts occurred in at least three of the countries in 1909, 1918, 1926, 1948, 1956 and 1976. The number of very poor years which occurred in Europe during the last two centuries is very much greater, with 71 since 1900. Moderate mast years are more likely to occur in only one or two of the countries at a time and have the effect of a partial depletion of resources within the tree, which distorts the masting pattern for following years. There is a presumption for an inherent biennial masting pattern, constrained by the internal resources of the tree, which is then strongly affected by climatic conditions.

TI  - Translocation of nitrogen in the xylem of field-grown cherry and poplar trees during remobilization.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Studies of small trees growing in pots have established that individual amino acids or amides are translocated in the xylem sap of a range of tree species following bud burst, as a consequence of nitrogen (N) remobilization from storage. This paper reports the first study of N translocation in the xylem of large, deciduous, field-grown trees during N remobilization in the spring. We applied 15N fertilizer to the soil around 10-year-old Prunus avium L. and Populus trichocharpa Torr. & Gray ex Hook var. Hastata (Dode) A. Henry x Populus balsamifera L. var. Michauxii (Dode) Farwell trees before bud burst to label N taken up by the roots. Recovery of unlabeled N in xylem sap and leaves was used to demonstrate that P. avium remobilizes N in both glutamine (Gln) and asparagine (Asn). Sap concentrations of both amides rose sharply after bud burst, peaking 14 days after bud burst for Gln, and remaining high some 45 days for Asn. There was no 15N enrichment of either amide until 21 days after bud burst. In the Populus trees, nearly all the N was translocated in the sap as Gln, the concentration of which peaked and then declined before the amide was enriched with 15N, 40 days after bud burst. Xylem sap of clonal P. avium trees was sampled at different positions in the crown to assess if the amino acid and amide composition of the sap varied within the crown. Sap was sampled during remobilization (when the concentration of Gln was maximal), at the end of remobilization and at the end of the experiment (68 days after bud burst). Although the date of sampling had a highly significant effect on sap composition, the effect of position of sampling was marginal. The results are discussed in relation to N translocation in adult trees and the possibility of measuring N remobilization by calculating the flux of N translocation in the xylem.

TI  - Masting in Fagus crenata and its influence on the nitrogen content and dry mass of winter buds.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary In Fagus, full-mast seeding years are invariably followed by at least one non-mast year. Both flower and leaf primordia develop during the summer within the same winter buds. Flower bud initiation occurs when the N content of developing seeds is increasing rapidly. We hypothesized that competition for nitrogen (N) between developing seeds and buds limits flower primordium formation in mast years and, hence, limits seed production in years following mast years. We tested this hypothesis in three Fagus crenataBlume forests at elevations of 550, 900 and 1500 m. Bud N concentration (Ncon), amount of N per bud (Nbud) and dry mass per bud (DM) were compared between a mast year (2005) and the following non-mast year (2006), and between winter buds containing both leaf and flower primoridia (BF), which were formed during the non-mast year, and winter buds containing leaf primordia only (BL), which were formed in both mast and non-mast years. In addition, leaf numbers per shoot corresponding to the analyzed buds were counted, and the effect of masting on litter production was analyzed by quantifying the amounts of litter that fell in the years 2004 to 2007. The dry mass and N content of BF formed in 2006 by trees at both 550 and 1500 m were 2.1–3.4-fold higher than the corresponding amounts in BL, although the numbers of leaves per current-year shoot in 2007 that developed from the two bud types in the same individuals did not differ significantly. These results indi cate that more N and carbohydrate are expended in producing BF than in producing BL. The amount of litter from reproductive organs produced in the mast year was similar to the amount of leaf litter at 900 and 1500 m, but three times as much at 550 m. Leaf numbers per shoot were significantly lower at all elevations in the mast year than in the non-mast years (and the amount of leaf litter at 550 and 1500 m tended to be lower in the mast year than in the non-mast years. In conclusion, preferential allocation of resources to seeds in the mast year reduced the availability of resources for flower primordium formation, and this may have accounted for the poor seed production in the following non-mast year.

TI  - Leaf traits, shoot growth and seed production in mature Fagus sylvatica trees after 8 years of CO2 enrichment
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background and Aims Masting, i.e. synchronous but highly variable interannual seed production, is a strong sink for carbon and nutrients. It may, therefore, compete with vegetative growth. It is currently unknown whether increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations will affect the carbon balance (or that of other nutrients) between reproduction and vegetative growth of forest species. In this study, reproduction and vegetative growth of shoots of mature beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees grown at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations were quantified. It was hypothesized that within a shoot, fruiting has a negative effect on vegetative growth, and that this effect is ameliorated at increased CO2 concentrations.Methods Reproduction and its competition with leaf and shoot production were examined during two masting events (in 2007 and 2009) in F. sylvatica trees that had been exposed to either ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations (530 ¬µmol mol?ai1) for eight consecutive years, between 2000 and 2008.Key Results The number of leaves per shoot and the length of terminal shoots was smaller or shorter in the two masting years compared with the one non-masting year (2008) investigated, but they were unaffected by elevated CO2 concentrations. The dry mass of terminal shoots was approx. 2-fold lower in the masting year (2007) than in the non-masting year in trees growing at ambient CO2 concentrations, but this decline was not observed in trees exposed to elevated CO2 concentrations. In both the CO2 treatments, fruiting significantly decreased nitrogen concentration by 25 % in leaves and xylem tissue of 1- to 3-year-old branches in 2009.Conclusions Our findings indicate that there is competition for resources between reproduction and shoot growth. Elevated CO2 concentrations reduced this competition, indicating effects on the balance of resource allocation between reproduction and vegetative growth in shoots with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

TI  - Understanding the roles of nonstructural carbohydrates in forest trees – from what we can measure to what we want to know
PY  - 2016
AB  - Contents 386 I. 386 II. 388 III. 392 IV. 392 V. 396 VI. 399 399 References 399 SUMMARY: Carbohydrates provide the building blocks for plant structures as well as versatile resources for metabolic processes. The nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), mainly sugars and starch, fulfil distinct functional roles, including transport, energy metabolism and osmoregulation, and provide substrates for the synthesis of defence compounds or exchange with symbionts involved in nutrient acquisition or defence. At the whole-plant level, NSC storage buffers the asynchrony of supply and demand on diel, seasonal or decadal temporal scales and across plant organs. Despite its central role in plant function and in stand-level carbon cycling, our understanding of storage dynamics, its controls and response to environmental stresses is very limited, even after a century of research. This reflects the fact that often storage is defined by what we can measure, that is, NSC concentrations, and the interpretation of these as a proxy for a single function, storage, rather than the outcome of a range of NSC source and sink functions. New isotopic tools allow direct quantification of timescales involved in NSC dynamics, and show that NSC-C fixed years to decades previously is used to support tree functions. Here we review recent advances, with emphasis on the context of the interactions between NSC, drought and tree mortality.

TI  - The Carbon Balance of Plants
PY  - 1972
AB  - There has been considerable recent interest in the assessment of the en­ ergy allocation of plants (38, 50, 52). It is likely that through a quantitative understanding of how different plants gain and allocate their resources it will be possible to make predictions as to their success in any given physical envi­ ronment in combination with any competitor and predator. We are still far from this reality. However, as a contribution toward this goal, this review seeks to gather the available. information on the various evolutionary strate­ gies which plants have evolved to gain energy and to account for the numer­ ous ways in which this energy is utilized to meet the demands of the environ­ ment, as well as to successfully produce progeny. To date, studies which have considered allocation have generally been at a rather gross level-e.g., reproductive versus nonreproductive (38), roots versus shoots (117), and photosynthetic versus nonphotosynthetic tissue (86). A study by Harper & Ogden (52) has attempted, however, to account in somewhat more detail for the various sources of energy allocation. To account in more detail for energy gain in allocation and for its even­ tual loss through a variety of routes, the approach that will be used here is the capture of carbon by plants and its SUbsequent diversion into various products which perform a multiplicity of functions. Carbon is the vehicle by which organisms store and transfer energy by chemical binding. This device enables the utilization of a large reservoir of physiological and ecological data into a single coherent body. However, it becomes rather clear that the total information required for any given plant simply does not exist. Thus, this review unfortunately can represent only a composite picture of the gen­ realized routes of carbon movement in plants. It does, however, call attention to the continual partitioning of resources and the multiplicity of carbon path­ ways. Emphasis is placed on the modes of capture of carbon. Hopefully, this analysis will stimulate studies which will provide, for a given series of bio­ types, the total information on carbon gain, use, and loss, so that quantitative models can be derived relating these to shortand long-term environmental influences.

TI  - Seasonal nitrogen cycling in the bark of field-grown Grey poplar is correlated with meteorological factors and gene expression of bark storage proteins
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary Seasonal tree-internal nitrogen cycling is an importantstrategyfortreestoachievehighefficiencyintheuseof nitrogen (N). Key processes of this N redistribution are autumnal leaf senescence and storage of released N as bark storage proteins(BSP)inperennialtissues.Whiletheregulationofleaf senescence has been intensively analysed in trees, the coordination of the complementary storage processes is still poorly understood. Therefore, we ascertained relationships between physiological-level and molecular-level processes and environmental factors under natural conditions in the bark of Populus×canescens. We analysed amino‐N concentrations, total soluble protein concentration and transcript abundances of BSP genes in the bark of field-grown P .× canescens harvested during two annual growth cycles. By correlation analysis and linear modelling, we assessed interactions between biological data and meteorological conditions. Day length correlated with BSP expression, and air temperature correlated strongly with total protein concentration (r = −0.92), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA; r = 0.76) and arginine (r = −0.70). GABA and arginine also correlated significantly with total protein concentration and transcript abundances of BSP genes. We conclude that GABA and arginine potentially contribute to adjust storage processes in the bark of poplar trees to seasonal changes in environmental conditions.

TI  - Contribution of Storage and Currently Assimilated Nitrogen to Vegetative and Reproductive Growth of Rabbiteye Blueberry
PY  - 1993
AB  - The relative contribution of storage and currently assimilated N to reproductive and vegetative growth of 'Bonita' and 'Climax' rabbiteye blueberry ( Vaccinium ashei Reade) was estimated immediately before and during the fruit development period. Total and storage N decreased in roots and shoots of both cultivars during dormancy and early fruit development. The principle N storage form appeared to be protein, as indicated by a significant decline in total shoot and root protein during this same period. Storage N from roots and shoots in both cultivars was remobilized to flowers and/or fruit and new vegetative growth. At anthesis, 90% of the total N present in reproductive organs was estimated to come from storage N. By fruit maturity, ≈ 50% of the accumulated N was derived from storage pools. Storage N contributed 90% of the total N in developing vegetative growth of 'Bonita' at leaf budbreak, which is concomitant with floral budbreak for this cultivar. Developing vegetative growth of 'Climax' at leaf budbreak, which occurs ≈ 4 weeks after floral budbreak, derived ≈ ≈ 65% of its total N from storage and 35% from currently assimilated N. By fruit maturity, contribution of storage N to new vegetative growth had decreased to ≈ ≈ 20% in both cultivars, indicating that currently assimilated N became the principal N supply as vegetative growth became more established. Differences in timing of floral and vegetative budbreak between the two cultivars did not appear to affect allocation of either storage or currently assimilated N to new vegetative or reproductive growth.

TI  - Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in Fagus crenata using a natural 13C approach
PY  - 2016
AB  - The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ13C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing 13C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ 13C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ 13C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.

TI  - Alternate Bearing Affects Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Starch Storage Pools in Mature Pistachio Trees
PY  - 1998
AB  - Abstract The relationship between crop load and the functional storage of selected macronutrients and starch was assessed to develop nutrient budgets and best management fertilization practices in orchards. Functional storage represents the amount of nutrients and starch redistributed from perennial tree parts in support of the spring growth flush. Functional storage was influenced by:(a)nutrient and starch accumulation prior to dormancy; and(b)nutrient and starch demand by vegetative and reproductive organs in spring. Lightly cropping (off-year) trees stored 7, 14 and 2 times as much N, P and K, respectively, as heavily cropping (on-year) trees. Similar to many biennial plant species, nutrients that accumulated during the vegetative phase in off-year trees were used to support reproductive growth during the subsequent on-year. Soil nutrient uptake contributed more to storage pools than leaf nutrient resorption in off-year-trees, while the reverse was true in on-year trees. Net nutrient resorption from senescing leaves accounted for all of the N and P and a third of the K stored in on-year trees. Only between 20–33% of the N, P and K stored in perennial tissues of off-year trees could be attributed to leaf nutrient resorption. This is the first study to determine the amounts of nutrients stored in the perennial parts of mature, field-grown trees and the relative contributions of leaf nutrient resorption and soil nutrient uptake to functional storage in trees.

TI  - Whole-tree dynamics of non-structural carbohydrate and nitrogen pools across different seasons and in response to girdling in two temperate trees
PY  - 2014
AB  - Despite extensive research on the seasonal dynamics of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations, the size and relative contributions of NSC and N pools across different tree organs are not well understood. We have measured the changes in NSC and N concentrations in leaves, branches, stems and all root branch orders at monthly intervals in control and girdled trees of larch (Larix gmelinii) and ash (Fraxinus mandshurica). The biomass of each plant compartment was also determined to calculate the size of the NSC and N pools. In both species, 13-37 % of the NSC and N pools were mobilized at the beginning of the growing season. Among the mobilized pools, stems and non-absorptive roots (branch orders 4-9) acted as the largest NSC sources in larch and ash, respectively, while branches served as the largest N source in both species. After stem girdling, 22 and 50 % of the root NSC stores in larch and ash, respectively, were mobilized to maintain root activities during the growing season. Tree mortality was observed 1 year after girdling, at which time there was still an abundant NSC pool in the roots. We conclude that (1) different storage organs differ in their contribution to new tissue growth at the beginning of the growing season and that those storage organs holding higher fractions of the NSC or N pool are not necessarily those which mobilize more NSC or N; (2) tree growth may not be limited by carbon (C) availability; (3) C storage in non-absorptive roots plays an important role in maintaining tree survival after the termination of photosynthate flow from aboveground sources.

TI  - Regulation of nitrate uptake at the whole-tree level: interaction between nitrogen compounds, cytokinins and carbon metabolism.
PY  - 2004
AB  - Pedospheric nitrate uptake is closely integrated with the nitrogen (N) status and demand of the whole tree. Signaling substances communicating the N demand of the shoot to the roots are required in an integrated regulatory system. Besides phloem mobility, such signal compounds must have the potential to repress or increase nitrate uptake either at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Amino compounds cycling within the tree are involved in the regulation of nitrate uptake. In many tree species, inorganic N is generally assimilated in roots, and amino acids--the direct products of N assimilation--are transported in the xylem to the sites of N demand. If the quantity of amino acids transported to the above-ground parts of the tree exceeds shoot N demand, some amino compounds are reallocated to the roots by phloem transport. Particular amino compounds exert transcriptional and post-transcriptional control over nitrate uptake by roots. Induction of nitrate transporters is mediated by nitrate or nitrite, or both, and possibly also by cytokinins, which cycle within the tree and act as both root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root signals. This review focuses on tree-specific requirements for N regulation and signaling, as well as the link between carbon metabolism and nitrate uptake.

TI  - Nitrogen as a key regulator of flowering in Fagus crenata: understanding the physiological mechanism of masting by gene expression analysis
PY  - 2014
AB  - The role of resource availability in determining the incidence of masting has been widely studied, but how floral transition and initiation are regulated by the resource level is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that floral transition is stimulated by high resource availabiltiy in Fagus crenata based on a new technique, the expression analyses of flowering genes. We isolated F. crenata orthologues of FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY and APETALA1, and confirmed their functions using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. We monitored the gene expression levels for 5 years and detected a cycle of on and off years, which was correlated with fluctuations of the shoot-nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen fertilisation resulted in the significantly higher expression of flowering genes than the control, where all of the fertilised trees flowered, whereas the control did not. Our findings identified nitrogen as a key regulator of mast flowering, thereby providing new empirical evidence to support the resource budget model.

TI  - Nitrogen storage and remobilization by trees: ecophysiological relevance in a changing world
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary The role of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage by trees will be discussed in terms of uncoupling their growth from resource acquisition. There are profound differences between the physiology of C and N storage. C storage acts as a short-term, temporary buffer when photosynthesis cannot meet current sink demand and remobilization is sink driven. However, the majority of C allocated to non-structural carbohydrates such as starch is not reused so is in fact sequestered, not stored. In contrast, N storage is seasonally programmed, closely linked to tree phenology and operates at temporal scales of months to years, with remobilization being source driven. We examine the ecological significance of N storage and remobilization in terms of regulating plant N use efficiency, allowing trees to uncouple seasonal growth from N uptake by roots and allowing recovery from disturbances such as browsing damage. We also briefly consider the importance of N storage and remobilization in regulating how trees will likely respond to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Most studies of N storage and remobilization have been restricted to small trees growing in a controlled environment where 15 N can be used easily as a tracer for mineral N. We highlight the need to describe and quantify these processes for adult trees in situ where most root N uptake occurs via ectomycorrhizal partners, an approach that now appears feasible for deciduous trees through quantification of the flux of remobilized N in their xylem. This opens new possibilities for studying interactions between N and C allocation in trees and associated mycorrhizal partners, which are likely to be crucial in regulating the response of trees to many aspects of global environmental change.

TI  - Non‐structural carbon compounds in temperate forest trees
PY  - 2003
AB  - The current carbon supply status of temperate forest trees was assessed by analysing the seasonal variation of nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in leaves, branch wood and stem sapwood of 10 tree species (six deciduous broad-leafed, one deciduous conifer and three evergreen conifer trees) in a temperate forest that is approximately 100 years old. In addition, all woody tissue was analysed for lipids (acylglycerols). The major NSC fractions were starch, sucrose, glucose and fructose, with other carbohydrates (e.g. raffinose and stachyose) and sugar alcohols (cyclitols and sorbitol) playing only a minor quantitative role. The radial distribution of NSC within entire stem cores, assessed here for the first time in a direct interspecific comparison, revealed large differences in the size of the active sapwood fraction among the species, reflecting the specific wood anatomy (ring-porous versus diffuse-porous xylem). The mean minimum NSC concentrations in branch wood during the growing season was 55% of maximum, and even high NSC concentrations were maintained during times of extensive fruit production in masting Fagus sylvestris . The NSC in stem sapwood varied very little throughout the season (cross species mean never below 67% of maximum), and the small reductions observed were not significant for any of the investigated species. Although some species contained substantial quantities of lipids in woody tissues (‘fat trees’; Tilia , Pinus , Picea , Larix ), the lipid pools did not vary significantly across the growing season in any species. On average, the carbon stores of deciduous trees would permit to replace the whole leave canopy four times. These data imply that there is not a lot of leeway for a further stimulation of growth by ongoing atmospheric CO 2 enrichment. The classical view that deciduous trees rely more on C-reserves than evergreen trees, seems unwarranted or has lost its justification due to the greater than 30% increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations over the last 150 years.

TI  - Are stored carbohydrates necessary for seed production in temperate deciduous trees
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. Many tree species undergo large fluctuations from year to year in seed production, a phenomenon known as masting. The resource budget model, based on the assumption that abundant seeding in a masting year depends on the abundance of resources stored over several years, is a key hypothesis in explaining the mechanism of masting. But do masting species really need such long-term storage to produce a large seed crop? 2. To test this hypothesis, we studied the relationship between the carbon accumulation period for seed production, as estimated by radiocarbon ( 14 C) analyses, and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production in 10 canopy tree species in a temperate deciduous forest. These species differ widely in their reproductive intervals. 3. In all the species studied, the accumulation period was < 1.4 years before seed maturation. Moreover, without taking species or reproductive intervals into account, there was no significant correlation between the carbon accumulation period and the fluctuation of annual seed production; both remained at an even level. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that temperate canopy trees used photosynthates produced in the current and/or the previous year for seed production, regardless of reproductive intervals. It might therefore be necessary to reconsider the importance of stored carbohydrate resources for masting.

TI  - The allometry of reproduction within plant populations
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. The quantitative relationship between size and reproductive output is a central aspect of a plant’s strategy: the conversion of growth into fitness. As plant allocation is allometric in the broad sense, i.e. it changes with size, we take an allometric perspective and review existing data on the relationship between individual vegetative (V, x-axis) and reproductive (R, y-axis) biomass within plant populations, rather than analysing biomass ratios such as reproductive effort (R ⁄ (R+V)). 2. The allometric relationship between R and V among individuals within a population is most informative when cumulative at senescence (total R–V relationship), as this represents the potential reproductive output of individuals given their biomass. Earlier measurements may be misleading if plants are at different developmental stages and therefore have not achieved the full reproductive output their size permits. Much of the data that have been considered evidence for plasticity in reproductive allometry are actually evidence for plasticity in the rate of growth and development. 3. Although a positive x-intercept implies a minimum size for reproducing, a plant can have a threshold size for reproducing without having a positive x-intercept. 4. Most of the available data are for annual and monocarpic species whereas allometric data on long-lived iteroparous plants are scarce. We find three common total R–V patterns: short-lived, herbaceous plants and clonal plants usually show a simple, linear relationship, either (i) passing through the origin or (ii) with a positive x-intercept, whereas larger and longer-lived plants often exhibit (iii) classical log–log allometric relationships with slope <1. While the determinants of plant size are numerous and interact with one another, the potential reproductive output of an individual is primarily determined by its size and allometric programme, although this potential is not always achieved. 5. Synthesis. The total R–V relationship for a genotype appears to be a relatively fixed-boundary condition. Below this boundary, a plant can increase its reproductive output by: (i) moving towards the boundary: allocating more of its resources to reproduction, or (ii) growing more to increase its potential reproductive output. At the boundary, the plant cannot increase its reproductive output without growing more first. Analysing size-dependent reproduction is the first step in understanding plant reproductive allocation, but more integrative models must include time and environmental cues, i.e. development.

TI  - Accumulation of Macro- and Micronutrients and Nitrogen Demand-supply Relationship of ‘Gala’/‘Malling 26’ Apple Trees Grown in Sand Culture

AB  - Six-year-old 'Gala'/'Malling26' ('M.26') apple (Malus ·domestica Borkh.) trees grown in sand culture were provided with a total of 30 g of N per tree as enriched 15 N-NH4NO3 in Hoagland's solution via fertigation to determine the magnitude and seasonal patterns of accumulation of macro- and micronutrients and the demand- supply relationship of N. Crop load was adjusted to 8.2 fruit/cm 2 trunk cross-sectional area, at king fruit diameter of 10 mm by hand-thinning. At each of seven key developmental stages throughout one annual growth cycle, four trees were excavated and destructively sampled for complete nutrient analysis. Nutrient concentrations in leaves and fruit fell within the recommended optimal range, and the fruit yield was 18.8 kg/tree (equivalent to 52.45 tha -1 ) with an average fruit weight of 181 g. The net accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S from budbreak to fruit harvest was 19.8, 3.3, 36.0, 14.2, 4.4, and 1.6 g/tree, respectively, and that for B, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe was 93.6, 60.9, 46.5, 184.8, and 148.7 mg/tree, respectively. Nutrient accumulation by new growth (fruit plus shoots and leaves) accounted for over 90% of the net gain for N, P, K, Mg, S, and B in the whole tree and a large proportion of the net gain for Ca, Zn, Mn, and Fe (from 58.1% for Zn to 87.2% of Fe) from budbreak to fruit harvest. Differential nutrient accumulation patterns were found in shoots and leaves and fruit. The most rapid accumulation of all nutrients in shoots and leaves took place during active shoot growth from bloom to the end of shoot growth. The accumulation pattern of most nutrients corresponded well with the accumulation of dry matter, with continued accumulation observed only in total Ca and Mn in shoots and leaves after the end of shoot growth. Nutrient accumulation in fruit largely followed its dry matter accumulation, and a large proportion of the nutrient accumulation (from 58.1% for Zn to 77.4% of K) occurred from the end of shoot growth to fruit harvest. At harvest, fruit contained more P, K, B, and Fe, whereas shoots and leaves had more N, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, and Mn. Most of the N demand by new growth at bloom was provided by tree reserve N. Remobilization of N from perennial parts of the tree was found to support rapid fruit expansion from the end of shoot growth to fruit harvest. The most rapid uptake from current season's N supply occurred from bloom to the end of shoot growth, corresponding to the highest tree N demand. At harvest, 62.4% of the total N in new growth was in shoots and leaves, with the balance in fruit. Reserve N and current season's N uptake each contributed about 50% to the total N in the whole tree at harvest.

TI  - Carbon limitation in trees
PY  - 2003
AB  - 1 The ongoing enrichment of the atmosphere with CO2 raises the question of whether growth of forest trees, which represent close to 90 global biomass carbon, is still carbon limited at current concentrations of close to 370 p.p.m. As photosynthesis of C3 plants is not CO2 -saturated at such concentrations, enhanced `source activity` of leaves could stimulate `sink activity` (i.e. growth) of plants, provided other resources and developmental controls permit. I explore current levels of non-structural carbon in trees in natural forests in order to estimate the potential for a carbon-driven stimulation of growth. 2 The concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in tree tissues is considered a measure of carbon shortage or surplus for growth. A periodic reduction of NSC pools indicates either that carbon demand exceeds con-current supply, or that both source and sink activity are low. A steady, very high NSC concentration is likely to indicate that photosynthesis fully meets, or even exeeds, that needed for growth (surplus assimilates accumulate). 3 The analysis presented here considers data for mature trees in four climatic zones: the high elevation treeline (in Mexico, the Alps and Northern Sweden), a temperate lowland forest of central Europe, Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland and a semideciduous tropical forest in Panama. 4 In all four climatic regions, periods of reduced or zero growth show maximum C-loading of trees (source activity exceeding demand), except for dry midsummer in the Mediterranean. NSC pools are generally high throughout the year, and are not significantly affected by mass fruiting episodes. 5 It is concluded that, irrespective of the reason for its periodic cessation, growth does not seem to be limited by carbon supply. Instead, in all the cases examined, sink activity and its direct control by the environment or developmental constraints, restricts biomass production of trees under current ambient CO2 concentrations. 6 The current carbohydrate charging of mature wild trees from the tropics to the cold limit of tree growth suggests that little (if any) leeway exists for further CO2-fertilization effects on growth.

TI  - Soil nitrogen affects phosphorus recycling: foliar resorption and plant-soil feedbacks in a northern hardwood forest.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Previous studies have attempted to link foliar resorption of nitrogen and phosphorus to their. respective availabilities in soil, with mixed results. Based on resource optimization theory, we hypothesized that the foliar resorption of one element could be driven by the availability of another element. We tested various measures of soil N and P as predictors of N and P resorption in six tree species in 18 plots across six stands at the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. Phosphorus resorption efficiency (P < 0.01) and proficiency (P = 0.01) increased with soil N content. to 30 cm depth, suggesting that trees conserve P based on the availability of soil N. Phosphorus resorption also increased with soil P content, which is difficult to explain basdd on single-element limitation, butfollows from the correlation between soil N and soil P. The expected single-element relationships were evident only in the 0 horizon: P resorption was high where resin-available P was low in the Oe (P < 0.01 for efficiency, P < 0.001 for proficiency) and N resorption was high where potential N mineralization in the Oa was low (P < 0.01 for efficiency and 0.11 for proficiency). Since leaf litter is a principal source of N and P to the 0 horizon, low nutrient availability there could be a result rather than a cause of high resorption. The striking effect of soil N content on foliar P resorption is the first evidence of multiple-element control on nutrient resorption to be reported from an unmanipulated ecosystem.

TI  - Nitrogen sources for current-year shoot growth in 50-year-old sessile oak trees: an in situ 15N labeling approach
PY  - 2011
AB  - We used long-term in situ (15)N labeling of the soil to investigate the contribution of the two main nitrogen (N) sources (N uptake versus N reserves) to sun shoot growth from bud burst to full leaf expansion in 50-year-old sessile oaks. Recovery of (15)N by growing compartments (leaves, twigs and buds) and presence of (15)N in phloem sap were checked weekly. During the first 2 weeks following bud burst, remobilized N contributed ~90% of total N in growing leaves and twigs. Nitrogen uptake from the soil started concomitantly with N remobilization but contributed only slightly to bud burst. However, the fraction of total N due to N uptake increased markedly once bud burst had occurred, reaching 27% in fully expanded leaves and 18% in developed twigs. In phloem sap, the (15)N label appeared a few days after the beginning of labeling and increased until the end of bud burst, and then decreased at full leaf expansion in June. Of all the shoot compartments, leaves attracted most of the absorbed N, which accounted for 68% of new N in shoots, whereas twigs and new buds accounted for only 28 and 3%, respectively. New N allocated to leaves increased from unfolding to full expansion as total N concentration in the leaves decreased. Our results underline the crucial role played by stored N in rapid leaf growth and in the sustained growth of oak trees. Any factors that reduce N storage in autumn may therefore impair spring shoot growth.

TI  - Allocation of resources to reproduction in Styrax obassia in a masting year
PY  - 2002
AB  - An analysis is presented of three possible pathways of reproductive allocation, namely, allocation of resources to reproductive organs from reproductive shoots, from non-reproductive shoots and from the main trunk. These pathways were examined by comparing the amount of storage starch in reproductive shoots, non-reproductive shoots and the main trunk in Styrax obassia, a typical masting tree species, during a year of little flowering (1999) and in a mass-flowering year (2000). In addition, we measured rates of light-saturated photosynthesis in leaves of reproductive and non-reproductive shoots to examine the contribution of photosynthetic production to reproductive costs. In both the main trunk and non-reproductive shoots the pattern of seasonal variation in the amount of starch did not differ between 1999 and 2000. However, in the mass-flowering year, the amount of starch in the reproductive shoots was less than that in non-reproductive shoots during the growing season. Thus, reproductive shoots bore most of the cost of reproduction, although non-reproductive shoots and the main trunk also bore some of the cost. Mass-based rates of light-saturated photosynthesis of the leaves of reproductive shoots were significantly higher than those of non-reproductive shoots during both the flowering and the fruiting period. However, leaves of reproductive shoots had a significantly smaller area, a lower mass per area, and lower concentrations of nitrogen than leaves of non-reproductive shoots, although the number of leaves did not differ between the two types of shoots. Therefore, the amount of photosynthate per shoot was significantly lower in reproductive shoots than in non-reproductive shoots. These results suggest that the cost of reproduction depends predominantly on storage starch in reproductive shoots, although it is still unclear how much photosynthate is allocated to reproductive organs from non-reproductive shoots.

TI  - Leaf-age effects on seasonal variability in photosynthetic parameters and its relationships with leaf mass per area and leaf nitrogen concentration within a Pinus densiflora crown.
PY  - 2008
AB  - In the temperate zone of Japan, Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. bears needles of up to three age classes in the upper crown and up to five age classes in the lower crown. To elucidate the effects of leaf age on photosynthetic parameters and its relationships with leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen (N(l)) concentration on an area (N(a)) and mass (N(m)) basis, we measured seasonal variations in LMA, N(l), light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), maximum rate of carboxylation (V(cmax)) and maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) in leaves of all age classes in the upper and lower crown. Leaf mass per unit area increased by 27% with increasing leaf age in the lower crown, but LMA did not depend on age in the upper crown. Leaf age had a significant effect on N(m) but not on N(a) in both crown positions, indicating that decreases in N(m) resulted from dilution. Photosynthetic parameters decreased significantly with leaf age in the lower crown (39% for A(max) and 43% for V(cmax)), but the effect of leaf age was not as great in the upper crown, although these parameters exhibited seasonal variation in both crown positions. Regression analysis indicated a close relationship between LMA and N(a), regardless of age class or when each age class was pooled (r(2) = 0.57-0.86). Relationships between LMA and N(a) and among A(max), V(cmax) and J(max) were weak or not significant when all age classes were examined by regression analysis. However, compared with older leaves, relationships among LMA, N(a) and A(max) were stronger in younger leaves. These results indicate that changes in LMA and N(l) mainly reflect light acclimation during leaf development, but they are only slightly affected by irradiance in mature leaves. In conclusion, LMA and N(l) are useful parameters for estimating photosynthetic capacity, but age-related effects need to be taken into account, especially in evergreen conifers.

TI  - How does Dryobalanops aromatica supply carbohydrate resources for reproduction in a masting year
PY  - 2005
AB  - The effect on reproduction of the dynamics of resource allocation was studied in an emergent and masting tree species, Dryobalanops aromatica (Dipterocarpaceae), in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. Girdling of the reproductive shoots (5 mm diameter) caused an increase in abortion during the flowering period, but did not affect the fruit set at the middle or final stages of seed maturation. In contrast, 50% defoliation significantly affected fruit setting, but had little effect on flowering. The total leaf area of reproductive shoots was significantly correlated with final fruit set and total fruit mass. Control of the carbohydrate supply to reproductive shoots by girdling and defoliation made no difference to fruit size, but the fruit number was highly sensitive to carbohydrate availability. Total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) decreased during the flowering period mainly in the branch (P<0.05), but fluctuated little in any organs during fruit maturation. Leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity of the reproductive shoots were not significant variables for reproduction. Our results suggest that D. aromatica uses current photosynthates in the leaves of reproductive shoots as a carbon source during fruit development, but requires stored assimilates in the branch for flowering. However, since TNC was still present in all organs even after flowering, our study also suggests that storage of carbohydrate resources might not be the decisive factor in the occurrence or frequency of flowering in this species.

TI  - Interspecific defoliation responses of trees depend on sites of winter nitrogen storage
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary

1
To determine if the response of trees to herbivory is related to their ability to store nitrogen, saplings of Pinus sylvestris L., Betula pendula Roth. and Sorbus aucuparia L. were clipped, either when dormant or at spring bud burst, to remove half the previous year’s shoot growth. The impact of clipping on N remobilization and uptake was quantified in relation to their growth responses.

2
Pinus sylvestris stored N during the winter in needles grown the previous summer, whereas B. pendula and S. aucuparia used their woody roots and older stems. Therefore, N remobilization was unaffected by clipping the deciduous species, but was reduced by half in the evergreen.

3
For both P. sylvestris and B. pendula, root uptake contributed N for leaf growth immediately after bud burst, concurrently with remobilization. Sorbus aucuparia had remobilized half the N from storage before any N was taken up by the roots.

4
Pinus sylvestris, which has a fixed pattern of growth, produced a lower total needle mass when clipped, but individual needles were heavier. Nitrogen uptake during summer was reduced by 26 and 44% for winter- and spring-clipped saplings, respectively. Both deciduous species showed compensatory leaf growth such that, by the end of the summer, leaf mass (and B. pendula leaf area) were unaffected by clipping. Nitrogen uptake by both deciduous species was unaffected by clipping.

5
We conclude that the site of N storage during winter is a crucial factor in determining the response of a sapling to herbivory, as interactions with the growth patterns of the three species can lead to different responses to damage. We suggest that for evergreen trees, the production of antiherbivory compounds serves primarily to protect N stored in their foliage, rather than the leaves themselves.

TI  - Nitrogen uptake, partitioning and internal cycling in Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. as influenced by nitrogen supply
PY  - 1993
AB  - SUMMARY
Four-year-old seedlings of Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. were grown in sand culture throughout 1989 and irrigated with nutrient solutions containing either 1.0 mol N m−3 (Low N) or 6.0 mol N m−3 (High N), to precondition their growth and capacity for N storage. During 1990 N enriched with 15N was supplied, either from 15 March to 27 June, or 28 June to 20 November. Recovery of unlabelled N was used to determine the storage and immobilization of N for foliage growth, and the partitioning of labelled N taken up during the two periods was measured.

Initial growth of trees in 1990 was unaffected by the current N supply and determined only by the N supplied the previous year. High N throughout increased the number of needles grown in 1990 compared to low N-treated trees, but had little effect on the dry weight of individual needles. When preconditioned with High N, trees responded to Low N in 1990 by a reduction in needle dry weight, without altering the number of needles produced. Low N trees supplied with High N in 1990 responded by increasing both needle numbers and dry weight, compared with trees supplied with Low N throughout. The amount of unlabelled N remobilized to foliage growth in 1990 was unaffected by the current N supply but reflected the amount of N in store, as determined by the N supply the previous year. The majority of N was remobilized from the 1989 foliage and none from roots. Partitioning of labelled N taken up during 1990 altered during the year, with a greater proportion of N taken up after 28 June recovered in the roots in all treatments, due to root growth as opposed to allocation of N to storage during the autumn, since root N concentrations fell between 17 June and the final harvest on 20 November.

TI  - A Dynamic Perspective on the Physiological Cost of Reproduction in Plants
PY  - 1994
AB  - The physiological cost of reproduction was investigated in a perennial plant species, Sidalcea oregana ssp. spicata. Two different classes of estimates of current reproductive investment were compared, with the goal of identifying the most powerful predictor of future reproductive effort. "Static" estimates, those typically used to measure current reproductive investment (i.e., biomass or nutrients allocated to reproduction), neglect the physiological processes that influence actual reproductive expenditure. Conversely, "dynamic" estimates that incorporate reproductive photosynthesis or respiration, nectar production, or reproductive nutrient resorption offer a more accurate assessment of current reproductive investment. I assessed the potential for nutrient resorption from senescing reproductive structures to mitigate the cost of reproduction. Significant proportions of nitrogen and phosphorus were resorbed from floral structures, but structures differed in resorption potential and efficiency. Moreover, ...

TI  - Does Rubisco control the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth? An exercise in molecular ecophysiology
PY  - 1994
AB  - Experiments are described in which tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) transformed with antisense rbcS to decrease expression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) was used to evaluate the contribution of Rubisco to the control of photosynthetic rate, and the impact of a changed rate of photosynthesis on whole plant composition, allocation and growth. (1) The concept of flux control coefficients is introduced. It is discussed how, with adequate precautions, a set of wild-type and transgenic plants with varying expression of an enzyme can be used to obtain experimental values for its flux control coefficient. (2) The flux control coefficient of Rubisco for photosynthesis depends on the short-term conditions. It increases in high light, or low CO2. (3) When plants are grown under constant irradiance, the flux control coefficient in the growth conditions is low (<0.2) at irradiances of up to 1000μmol quanta m−2 s−1. In a natural irradiance regime exceeding 1500μmol quanta m−2 s−2 over several hours the flux coefficient rose to 0.8–0.9. It is concluded that plants are able to adjust the balance between Rubisco and the remainder of the photosynthetic machinery, and thereby avoid a one-sided limitation of photosynthesis by Rubisco over a wide range of ambient growth irradiance regimes. (4) When the plants were grown on limiting inorganic nitrogen, Rubisco had a higher flux control coefficient (0.5). It is proposed that, in many growth conditions, part of the investment in Rubisco may be viewed as a nitrogen store, albeit bringing additional marginal advantages with respect to photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency. (5) A change in the rate of photosynthesis did not automatically translate into a change in growth rate. Several factors are identified which contribute to this buffering of growth against a changed photosynthetic rate. (6) There is an alteration in whole plant allocation, resulting in an increase in the leaf area ratio. The increase is mainly due to a higher leaf water content, and not to changes in shoot/root allocation. This increased investment in whole plant leaf area partly counteracts the decreased efficiency of photosynthesis at the biochemical level. (7) Plants with decreased Rubisco have a lower intrinsic water use efficiency and contain high levels of inorganic cations and anions. It is proposed that these are a consequence of the increased rate of transpiration, and that the resulting osmotic potential might be a contributory factor to the increased water content and expansion of the leaves. (8) Starch accumulation in source leaves is decreased when unit leaf photosynthesis is reduced, allowing a more efficient use of the fixed carbon. (9) Decreased availability of carbohydrates leads to a down-regulation of nitrate assimilation, acting via a decrease in nitrate reductase activity.

Nutrients can be conserved mainly by extending the life span of plant parts and/or by minimizing the nutrient content of those parts that are abscissed. Together these two parameters (life span and resorption) define the mean residence time (MRT) of a nutrient. In this review we summarize available information on nitrogen resorption and life span, and evaluate their relationship to the MRT of nitrogen, both between and within species. Abundant information with respect to nitrogen resorption efficiency and life span is available at the leaf level. By definition, woody evergreen plants have a much longer leaf life span than species of other life-forms. Conversely, differences in resorption efficiency among life-forms or among plants in habitats differing in soil fertility appear to be small. Inter-specific variation in leaf life span is much larger than intra-specific variation (factor of >200 compared with 2, respectively), while resorption efficiency varies by about the same magnitude at both levels (factor of 3.8 compared with 2.7, respectively). The importance of resorption efficiency in determining leaf-level MRT increases exponentially towards and above the maximum resorption efficiency observed in nature. This effect is independent of leaf life span, which may explain the lack of life-form related differences in resorption efficiency. When scaling up from the leaf to the whole-plant level, fundamental differences in turnover rate among different plant organs must be considered. Woody species invest c. 50% of their net productivity into their low-turnover stems, while in herbaceous species the life span of stems is only slightly longer than that of leaves. As a result, nutrient turnover of woody (evergreen and deciduous) plants is generally lower than that of herbaceous species (herbs and graminoids) on a whole-plant basis. At the intra-specific level empirical data show that both biomass life span (i.e. the inverse of biomass loss rate) and resorption efficiency are important sources of variation in MRT. However, we argue that the relative importance of resorption efficiency in explaining variation in MRT is lower at the inter-specific level, whereas the reverse is true for life span. This is because variation in MRT and life span is much larger at the inter-specific level compared with variation in resorption efficiency. Plant traits related to nutrient conservation are discussed with respect to their implications for leaf structure, plant growth, competition, succession and ecosystem nutrient cycling.

TI  - Vegetative storage protein in Litchi chinensis, a subtropical evergreen fruit tree, possesses trypsin inhibitor activity.
PY  - 2007
AB  - † Background and Aims Vegetative storage proteins (VSPs) are commonly bioactive in herbaceous plants but few VSPs with bioactivity have been identified in trees. In addition, information on the characterization of VSPs in evergreen trees is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the VSPs with bioactivity in evergreen trees. † Methods The VSP in lychee (Litchi chinensis), an evergreen fruit tree, was characterized by a combination of cytological, biochemical and molecular biological techniques. † Key Results The VSP in lychee was a 22-kDa protein. It accumulated in the large central vacuoles of proteinstoring cells (PSCs) in two distinguishable forms, granular and floccular. The PSCs were of a novel type. The 22-kDa protein is distributed in mature leaves, bark tissues of branches, trunk and large roots, paralleling the distribution of PSCs. Its homologues were present in mature seed. During young shoot development and fruiting, the 22-kDa protein decreased apparently, suggesting a nitrogen-storage function. The 22-kDa protein had several isoforms encoded by a small multigene family. One gene member, LcVSP1, was cloned. The LcVSP1 had no intron and contained a 675 bp open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 225 amino acids. LcVSP1 was homologous to Kunitz trypsin inhibitors. The 22-kDa protein inhibited trypsin and chymotrypsin, but had no inhibitory effect on subtilisin. † Conclusions Lychee is rich in a 22-kDa VSP with trypsin inhibitor activity. The VSP plays an important role in nitrogen storage while its possible defensive function remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Age-Related Changes in Tree Growth and Functional Biology: The Role of Reproduction
PY  - 2011
AB  - Population biologists have generally assumed that reproduction entails a reduction in growth, future reproduction, and/or increase in mortality: such “costs of reproduction” are central to life-history models that predict patterns of reproductive allocation, growth curves, and other aspects of plant ontogeny. However, the apparent importance of biophysical processes (such as hydraulic limitation effects) has led to a widespread view that physiological effects of reproduction play a minor role, if any, in driving age-related patterns of tree growth and functional traits. This chapter assesses available data to detect and measure the role of reproduction on tree functional biology, where possible by use of meta-analysis to integrate results across studies. Trees generally show a long period of pre-reproductive growth, and a pattern of increasing reproductive allocation with size, as predicted by life-history theory. The widespread existence of substantial physiological costs of reproduction in trees is indicated by several sources of comparative data. (1) Reproductive allocation generally increases with tree size, and recent studies suggest that >40% of fixed carbon may be allocated annually to reproductive structures in mature forests. (2) There are ∼100 species of monocarpic trees in which rapid senescence is triggered by a single reproductive event. (3) Dendrochronological studies comparing stem growth increment to measures of fruit production across years, generally find negative correlations, even when statistically accounting for environmental effects such as growing season temperature and precipitation. These studies also document carry-over effects, in which intense reproductive events reduce tree performance over multiple years. (4) Shoots near reproductive structures generally show reduced shoot extension growth, leaf size, and leaf N content, among other changes. There is also some evidence that leaf traits related to carbon gain (such as leaf size, photosynthetic capacity and leaf N) increase with size among small pre-reproductive trees, but decrease following reproduction. (5) Studies of sexual dimorphism in dioecious tree species generally find patterns consistent with a higher cost of reproductive in female (pistillate) individuals, which show reduced growth. Analyses of growth curves of some dioecious tree species also indicate sexual dimorphism in patterns of growth decline late in tree ontogeny, consistent with a strong role of reproduction in determining the form of growth declines. In conclusion, reproduction cannot be dismissed as of only minor importance as a determinant of age-related trends in tree functional biology. The physiological mechanisms for reproductive effects, their comparative biology, and their interactions with other processes that limit growth deserve much greater research attention.

TI  - Nonstructural carbon in woody plants.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Nonstructural carbon (NSC) provides the carbon and energy for plant growth and survival. In woody plants, fundamental questions about NSC remain unresolved: Is NSC storage an active or passive process? Do older NSC reserves remain accessible to the plant? How is NSC depletion related to mortality risk? Herein we review conceptual and mathematical models of NSC dynamics, recent observations and experiments at the organismal scale, and advances in plant physiology that have provided a better understanding of the dynamics of woody plant NSC. Plants preferentially use new carbon but can access decade-old carbon when the plant is stressed or physically damaged. In addition to serving as a carbon and energy source, NSC plays important roles in phloem transport, osmoregulation, and cold tolerance, but how plants regulate these competing roles and NSC depletion remains elusive. Moving forward requires greater synthesis of models and data and integration across scales from -omics to ecology.

TI  - Nitrogen storage and seasonal nitrogen cycling in Populus: bridging molecular physiology and ecophysiology
PY  - 2005
AB  - While both annual and perennial plants store nitrogen resources during the growing season, seasonal N cycling is a hallmark of the perennial habit. In Populus the vegetative storage proteins BSP, WIN4 and PNI288 all play a role in N storage during active growth, whereas BSP is the major form of reduced N storage during winter dormancy. In this review we explore cellular and molecular events implicated in seasonal N cycling in Populus, as well as environmental cues that modulate both the phenology of seasonal N cycling, and the efficiency and proficiency of autumn N resorption. We highlight recent advances that have been made using Populus genomics resources to address processes germane to seasonal N cycling. Genetic and genetological studies are enabling us to connect our understanding of seasonal N cycling at molecular and cellular levels with that at ecophysiological levels. With the genomics resources and foundational knowledge that are now in place, Populus researchers are poised to build an integrative understanding of seasonal N cycling that spans from genomes to ecosystems.

TI  - Soluble N compounds in trees exposed to high loads of N: a comparison between the roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees grown under field conditions
PY  - 1998
AB  - SUMMARY During the growing session of 1995, the total soluble non-protein nitrogen (TSNN) composition and contents of mycorrhizal fine roots, xylem sap and phloem exudates of roots from a coniferous (Picea abies L.(Karst)) and a deciduous (Fagus sylvatica L.) tree species were analysed at a field site ('Hoglwald', Germany) exposed to high loads of N. In April, TSNN in fine roots of spruce and beech trees amounted to 16 jtmol N g-' f. wt and 23 3 ,umol N g-' f. wt, respectively. It decreased to 9 2 ,umol N g-' f. wt and 18 1 ,umol N g-' f. wt, respectively, after bud break in June. The seasonal maximum of TSNN in fine roots of spruce was observed in July (32 7 ,tmol N g-' f. wt) followed by a decline of c. 30 % until the end of the growing season in September. TSNN in fine roots of beech trees showed a further decline between June and July, when its seasonal minimum was determined (1 56 ,umol N g-1 f. wt), and increased to c. 29 ,umol N g-1 f. wt until September. In spruce roots Gln and Arg were the most abundant TSNN compounds during the entire growing season. In roots of beech Asn played an important role alongside Gln and Arg, especially in April, when it was the most abundant TSNN compound. Other proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic N compounds comprised c. 20-30 % of TSNN. Nitrate made up < 1 %, and ammonium < 7 % of TSNN in the fine roots of both species. In April, TSNN in the xylem sap of roots of spruce and beech trees amounted to 3 4 and 8 6 /tmol N ml-', respectively. In roots of spruce trees xylem sap TSNN increased after bud break up to 12 7 ,umol N ml-' in July. At the end of the growing season TSNN had declined again to 3 9 ,tmol N ml-'. TSNN in the root xylem sap of beech trees decreased after bud break until July (2 4 ,umol N ml-' in July) followed by a slight increase until September (2 9 ,tmol N ml-'). Arg, Gln and Asp were the most abundant TSNN compounds in the xylem sap of spruce trees contributing together c. 90 % to TSNN. The same TSNN compounds prevailed in the root xylem sap of beech trees in April and July, whereas in June and September Asp was replaced by Asn comprising 57 % of TSNN in June. In addition to the N compounds mentioned above, a number of other proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino compounds were found in root xylem sap of both species. In either species, nitrate and ammonium were present in small amounts, contributing < 1 % and < 4 % to TSNN, respectively. Apparently, inorganic N taken up by the mycorrhizal roots is mainly assimilated in root tissues or by the mycorrhiza and N

TI  - Seasonal changes in carbon and nitrogen compound concentrations in a Quercus petraea chronosequence.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Forest productivity declines with tree age. This decline may be due to changes in metabolic functions, resource availability and/or changes in resource allocation (between growth, reproduction and storage) with tree age. Carbon and nitrogen remobilization/storage processes are key to tree growth and survival. However, studies of the effects of tree age on these processes are scarce and have not yet considered seasonal carbon and nitrogen variations in situ. This study was carried out in a chronosequence of sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.) for 1 year to survey the effects of tree age on the seasonal changes of carbon and nitrogen compounds in several tree compartments, focusing on key phenological stages. Our results highlight a general pattern of carbon and nitrogen function at all tree ages, with carbon reserve remobilization at budburst for growth, followed by carbon reserve formation during the leafy season and carbon reserve use during winter for maintenance. The variation in concentrations of nitrogen compounds shows less amplitude than that of carbon compounds. Storage as proteins occurs later, and mainly depends on leaf nitrogen remobilization and root uptake in autumn. We highlight several differences between tree age groups, in particular the loss of carbon storage function of fine and medium-sized roots with tree ageing. Moreover, the pattern of carbon compound accumulation in branches supports the hypothesis of a preferential allocation of carbon towards growth until the end of wood formation in juvenile trees, at the expense of the replenishment of carbon stores, while mature trees start allocating carbon to storage right after budburst. Our results demonstrate that at key phenological stages, physiological and developmental functions differ with tree age, and together with environmental conditions, influence the carbon and nitrogen concentration variations in sessile oaks.

TI  - Nutrients in Senesced Leaves: Keys to the Search for Potential Resorption and Resorption Proficiency
PY  - 1996
AB  - Analyses of nitrogen and phosphorus in the senesced leaves of 89 species of deciduous and evergreen woody perennials were used (1) to discover the limits of ultimate potential resorption (maximal withdrawal of nutrients from senescing leaves), (2) to determine a means by which resorption can be categorized as complete or incomplete, (3) to develop the concept of resorption proficiency (measured as the levels to which nutrients have been reduced in senesced leaves), (4) to compare resorption in evergreen vs. deciduous species, (5) to assess the impact of phylogeny on resorption, (6) to compare resorption in actinorhizal vs. non—nitrogen—fixing species, and (7) to consider the efficacy of using multiple measures of resorption to answer questions regarding the function and evolution of this process, rather than relying solely on analyses of resorption efficiency (percentage reduction of nutrients between green and senesced leaves). Concentrations of 0.3% nitrogen and 0.01% phosphorus in senesced leaves represent ultimate potential resorption of these nutrients in woody perennials. Resorption proficiency and potential resorption were quantitatively defined in two models that describe both resorption that is maximal and biochemically complete, and that which is not. Resorption is highly proficient in plants that have reduced nitrogen and phosphorus in their senescing leaves to concentrations below 0.7% and 0.05%, respectively. An important feature of knowing the levels to which nutrients can be reduced in senescing leaves is that these values offer an objective gauge by which to measure the success of resorption as a nutrient conservation mechanism. Evergreens were significantly more proficient at resorbing phosphorus than were deciduous species (0.045% vs. 0.067% P in senesced leaves, respectively) and plants capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation were significantly less proficient at resorbing nitrogen than were nonfixers (1.6% vs. 0.9% N in senesced leaves, respectively). Resorption proficiency appeared to parallel some phylogenic trends, yet the influence of phylogeny was not so significant as to overwhelm the effects of recent selection. The ability of plants to reduce nitrogen in senescing leaves was significantly correlated with their ability to reduce phosphorus. Measurement and analysis of resorption proficiency, when coupled with concurrent consideration of potential resorption and resorption efficiency, should facilitate and expedite the ongoing attempt to resolve complex questions regarding the environmental constraints that influence resorption, and the selection pressures that have directed the evolution of this process.

TI  - Masting behaviour in beech: linking reproduction and climatic variation
PY  - 2001
AB  - The question of what triggers masting in beech (Fagus) has been a source of uncertainty and curiosity. Analysing seed production series from Europe (Fagus sylvatica L.), eastern North America (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), and Japan (Fagus crenata Blume), for various periods (lasting between 6 and 34 years) over the last 150 years, we find a close relationship between masting (mast year) and preceding growing season climate events (mast year1 and mast year2) in eastern North America and Europe, with tentative indications of this pattern in Japan. A drought in the early summer preceding masting (mast year1) is a very strong predictor in Europe and eastern North America, but drought events were not found for the Japan series. The predictive power is increased in all three regions if there has been an unusually moist, cool summer the year before the drought (mast year2). We suggest that, in this initial moist summer (mast year2), carbohydrate buildup within the trees "primes" them for floral induction the f...

TI  - Influence of reproduction on nitrogen uptake and allocation to new organs in Fagus crenata
PY  - 2017
AB  - The contributions of the internal nitrogen (N) cycle and N uptake from soil to growth in mature trees remain poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how reproduction affects N uptake, allocation and remobilization, we applied pulse 15N labelling to three fruiting (F) and three non-fruiting (NF) Fagus crenata Blume trees after the leaves were fully unfurled. Three-year-old branches were sampled from upper crowns at about 2 week intervals until leaf fall. 15N content per organ dry mass (15Nexcess) and N concentration in all new shoot organs were determined. Fruiting led to greater 15Nexcess uptake from the soil during the first month following application. Cupules absorbed the highest fraction of 15Nexcess initially and nuts contained about half the 15Nexcess at the end of the growing season. Biomass of reproductive organs represented up to 70% of new shoot growth in F trees. This fruit burden led to 34% and 38% reduction in biomass and 15Nexcess, respectively, in mature leaves compared with NF trees. Moreover, the increment of 15Nexcess in new shoots of F relative to NF trees was lower than the increment of biomass between the two. These results indicate that N is a limiting resource during masting in F. crenata. 15Nexcess incorporated into nuts started to increase dramatically once 15Nexcess in leaves, branches and cupules hit seasonal maxima. Similar seasonal biomass growth patterns were also found in these organs, indicating that sink strength drives uptake and allocation of 15Nexcess between new shoot compartments. These results, together with translocation of 15Nexcess from cupules and senescing leaves to nuts (contributing to fruit ripening), suggest that a finely tuned growth phenology alleviated N limitation. Thus, fruiting did not influence the N concentration in leaves or branches. These reproduction-related variations in N uptake and allocation among new shoot compartments have implications for N dynamics in the plant-soil system.

TI  - Spatially limited pollen exchange and a long-range synchronization of trees
PY  - 2002
AB  - Many trees in mature forests show intermittent reproduction. Intensive flowering and seed production occur only once in several years, often synchronized over a long distance. In a previous paper, we showed that the limitation of fruit production by the outcross pollen availability can bring about synchronized reproduction of trees in a constant environment, assuming that pollen availability depends on the mean flowering intensity of the trees. However, pollen exchange normally occurs within a distance much shorter than the extent of the whole forest. We studied a coupled map lattice, in which each tree engages in the chaotic dynamics of energy reserve level, but different trees are coupled by pollen exchange with neighbors. We first derived a relation between two statistics of spatial covariance (dynamic spatial covariance and snapshot spatial covariance). A strong synchronization of tree reproduction can develop over the whole forest that may be orders of magnitude larger than the distance of direct pollen exchange between trees. The fluctuation is close to a cycle with a period of two years. The model of local coupling always generates non-uniform spatial patterns, but the enhanced spatial covariance caused by the spatial heterogeneity is restricted to a short range, only a few times larger than the spatial range of direct interaction. When pollen exchange occurs beyond the nearest neighbors, the local spatial pattern becomes proportionally larger, but the condition for synchronization of the whole forest and its magnitude are the same as for the case with the nearest neighbor pollen exchange. When a fraction of the seeds are sired by globally dispersed pollen and the rest are sired by local pollen, long-range synchronization can occur for a wide-parameter region, and trees may engage in a fluctuation with a masting interval longer than two years. We discuss alternative explanations for the long-range synchronization of beech forests.

TI  - Regulation of Flowering by Trehalose-6-Phosphate Signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana
PY  - 2013
AB  - The timing of the induction of flowering determines to a large extent the reproductive success of plants. Plants integrate diverse environmental and endogenous signals to ensure the timely transition from vegetative growth to flowering. Carbohydrates are thought to play a crucial role in the regulation of flowering, and trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) has been suggested to function as a proxy for carbohydrate status in plants. The loss of TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 (TPS1) causes Arabidopsis thaliana to flower extremely late, even under otherwise inductive environmental conditions. This suggests that TPS1 is required for the timely initiation of flowering. We show that the T6P pathway affects flowering both in the leaves and at the shoot meristem, and integrate TPS1 into the existing genetic framework of flowering-time control.

TI  - Relationship between shoot-rooting and root-sprouting abilities and the carbohydrate and nitrogen reserves of Mediterranean dwarf shrubs.
PY  - 2007
AB  - † Background and Aims This study analysed the differences in nitrogen (N), non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and biomass allocation to the roots and shoots of 18 species of Mediterranean dwarf shrubs with different shoot-rooting and resprouting abilities. Root N and NSC concentrations of strict root-sprouters and species resprouting from the base of the stems were also compared. † Methods Soluble sugars (SS), starch and N concentrations were assessed in roots and shoots. The root : shoot ratio of each species was obtained by thorough root excavations. Cross-species analyses were complemented by phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). † Key Results Shoot-rooting species showed a preferential allocation of starch to shoots rather than roots as compared with non-shoot-rooting species. Resprouters displayed greater starch concentrations than non-sprouters in both shoots and roots. Trends were maintained after PICs analyses, but differences became weak when root-sprouters versus non-root-sprouters were compared. Within resprouters, strict root-sprouters showed greater root concentrations and a preferential allocation of starch to the roots than stem-sprouters. No differences were found in the root : shoot ratio of species with different rooting and resprouting abilities. † Conclusions The shoot-rooting ability of Mediterranean dwarf shrubs seems to depend on the preferential allocation of starch and SS to shoots, though alternative C-sources such as current photosynthates may also be involved. In contrast to plants from other mediterranean areas of the world, the resprouting ability of Mediterranean dwarf shrubs is not related to a preferential allocation of N, NSC and biomass to roots.

TI  - Parameterisation and validation of a resource budget model for masting using spatiotemporal flowering data of individual trees
PY  - 2016
AB  - Synchronised and fluctuating reproduction by plant populations, called masting, is widespread in diverse taxonomic groups. Here, we propose a new method to explore the proximate mechanism of masting by combining spatiotemporal flowering data, biochemical analysis of resource allocation and mathematical modelling. Flowering data of 170 trees over 13 years showed the emergence of clustering with trees in a given cluster mutually synchronised in reproduction, which was successfully explained by resource budget models. Analysis of resources invested in the development of reproductive organs showed that parametric values used in the model are significantly different between nitrogen and carbon. Using a fully parameterised model, we showed that the observed flowering pattern is explained only when the interplay between nitrogen dynamics and climatic cues was considered. This result indicates that our approach successfully identified resource type-specific roles on masting and that the method is suitable for a wide range of plant species.

TI  - Dynamics of mineral nutrient storage for mast reproduction in the tropical emergent tree Dryobalanops aromatica
PY  - 2011
AB  - Limitations in resources are considered to be important in mass-fruiting trees, based on the speculation that they need to consume a large amount of stored resources in a very short period. To test this hypothesis, we studied the total reproductive costs per individual of the tree Dryobalanops aromatica (Dipterocarpaceae), and the dynamics of stored mineral nutrients, specifically nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium; we then estimated the contribution of each of the stored resources to reproduction in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. D. aromatica is an emergent and masting tree species, and it produced a large amount of mature fruit in a masting period running 2001–2002. The dynamics patterns were markedly different for each of the stored nutrients. The phosphorus concentration clearly decreased in the branch, stem and root during reproduction, but nitrogen fluctuated by only a small amount in any organ during this period. The potassium concentration fell in all organs during flowering, but even increased during fruit development. Stored phosphorus accounted for 67.7% of the total phosphorus requirements for reproduction, but nitrogen accounted for only 19.7%. Stored potassium did not appear to contribute anything, at least to fruit production. Our results suggest that D. aromatica supplies phosphorus needed for reproduction mainly from stored resources in the tree, unlike nitrogen or potassium. The accumulation of phosphorus could be the decisive factor in the occurrence and frequency of mast reproduction in the relatively poor soil conditions prevailing in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia.

<jats:p>Mature almond [<jats:italic>Prunus dulcis</jats:italic> (Mill) D.A. Webb] trees growing on light-(Delhi sand) and heavy-textured (Yolo silty clay loam) soils were fertilized with <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N-depleted ammonium sulfate at different times during the year to permit direct measurement of fertilizer N within the trees. The distribution of fertilizer N between vegetative and reproductive organs was monitored during both the year of application, 1980, and the subsequent year. The later that fertilizer N was applied during the season, the less fertilizer N was recovered in the fruit and leaves that year, and the greater its N contribution to these organs was the following year. Isotopic labeling of fruit and leaves appeared to be relatively unaffected by soil texture during the year of fertilizer application. During the subsequent year, however, the recovery of fertilizer N by fruit and leaves was 2-fold greater on the heavy-textured soil than on the light-textured soil. Recovery of labeled N in fruit was relatively low on both soil types following application of fertilizer during the dormant period. Isotopic N was recovered in fruit in both 1980 and 1981 and constituted about 20% to 28% of fruit N at most. About 25% of the applied N was removed in the fruit on the heavy-textured soil over a 2-year period. Up to 1 kg N per tree was removed annually in the harvested fruit.</jats:p>

TI  - piecewiseSEM: Piecewise structural equation modelling in r for ecology, evolution, and systematics
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary

Ecologists and evolutionary biologists rely on an increasingly sophisticated set of statistical tools to describe complex natural systems. One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables.


Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models.


Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts.


My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.

TI  - How seed defense and seed abundance predict dispersal and survival patterns in Camellia.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Little is known about how seed defense and seed abundance interact with behavioral responses of seed dispersers to predict dispersal and survival dynamics in animal-dispersed plants. By tracking the fate of individual seeds in Camellia stands with high and low seed abundance in Southwest China in 2007, we investigated the dispersal and survival of 2 high-saponin Camellia species (Camellia oleifera and Camellia sinensis and 1 non-saponin species (peanut Arachis hypogaea) as a control. Saponins in Camellia seeds are chemical compounds that act as seed defense. Our results were most consistent with the predictions based on the predator satiation hypothesis and the plant defense hypothesis. At the abundant Camellia stand (predators and dispersers were satiated), more Camellia seeds survived at the source but fewer were hoarded and survived at cache sites. At the sparse Camellia stand (predators and dispersers were not satiated), no Camellia seeds survived at the source, but more Camellia seeds were hoarded and survived at cache sites. Unlike Camellia seeds, no peanuts survived at the source at both stands, while more peanuts were hoarded and then survived at cache sites in the abundant Camellia stand compared to none at the sparse Camellia stand. In addition, the 2 Camellia species showed similar trends for seed fates across different dispersal stages. Our study indicates that the combined effects of seed abundance and seed defense, compared to their separate effects, provide a more accurate prediction for dispersal and survival patterns in animal-dispersed Camellia species.

TI  - Are Species Adapted to Their Regeneration Niche, Adult Niche, or Both?
PY  - 2007
AB  - Functional traits are important drivers of successional processes and the assembly of plant communities. It is generally assumed that functional traits are closely linked to the regeneration niche because of the high selection pressures in the seedling stage, but recent studies have challenged this view. In this study, I use cross species and phylogenetic correlation analysis between leaf traits and light environment to evaluate whether species are adapted to the regeneration niche, adult niche, or both. Leaf chemistry, morphology, physiology, and crown exposure were quantified for up to 58 Bolivian tropical moist forest tree species that differ in their regeneration and adult light niche. Multiple regression analysis shows that leaf traits of seedlings, saplings, and trees are most strongly related to the regeneration niche, and once this is taken into account, adult niche does not significantly explain any of the remaining variation in leaf traits. This suggests that, although the regeneration phase is short, it has a long-lasting effect on the form and shape of plant species.

TI  - How many seeds does it take to make a sapling
PY  - 2014
AB  - Tall canopy trees produce many more seeds than do understory treelets, yet, on average, both classes of trees achieve the same lifetime fitness. Using concurrent data on seedfall (8 years) and sapling recruitment (12 years) from a long-established tree plot at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru, we show, that a 40-m canopy tree must produce roughly 13 times the mass of seeds to generate a sapling as a 5-m tall understory treelet. Mature tree height accounted for 41% of the variance in seed mass per sapling recruit in a simple univariate regression, whereas a multivariate model that included both intrinsic (seed mass, tree height, and dispersal mode) and extrinsic factors (sapling mortality as a surrogate for microsite quality) explained only 31% of the variance in number of seeds per sapling recruit. The multivariate model accounted for less variance because tall trees produce heavier seeds, on average, than treelets. We used qintactq (mostly dispersed) seeds to parameterize the response variable so as to reduce, if not eliminate, any contribution of conspecific crowding to the difference in reproductive efficiency between canopy trees and treelets. Accordingly, a test for negative density dependence failed to expose a relationship between density of reproductive trees in the population and reproductive efficiency (seed mass per recruit). We conclude that understory treelets, some of which produce only a dozen seeds a year, gain their per-seed advantage by failing to attract enemies a la Janzen-Connell, either in ecological or evolutionary time.

TI  - Species with greater seed mass are more tolerant of conspecific neighbours: a key driver of early survival and future abundances in a tropical forest.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Multiple niche-based processes including conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) determine plant regeneration and community structure. We ask how interspecific and intraspecific density-dependent interactions relate to plant life histories and associated functional traits. Using hierarchical models, we analysed how such interactions affected first-year survival of seedling recruits of 175 species in a tropical forest, and how species abundances and functional traits are related to interspecific variation in density-dependent effects. Conspecific seedling neighbour effects prevailed over the effects of larger conspecific and all heterospecific neighbours. Tolerance of seedling CNDD enhanced recruit survival and subsequent abundance, all of which were greater among larger seeded, slow-growing and well-defended species. Niche differentiation along the growth–survival trade-off and tolerance of seedling CNDD strongly correlated with regeneration success, with manifest consequences for community structure. The ability of larger seeded species to better tolerate CNDD suggests a novel mechanism for CNDD to contribute to seed-size variation and promote species coexistence through a tolerance–fecundity trade-off.

TI  - POST-DISPERSAL CHANGES IN THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF FAGUS CRENATA SEEDS
PY  - 2002
AB  - The spatial distribution of tree seeds is influenced by the behavior of seed dispersers and seed-killing agents. In this study we evaluated the relative importance of multiple seed-killing agents on changes in the spatial pattern of Fagus crenata seeds. The dispersal of seeds and causes of seed death following dispersal were investigated on a 0.6- ha study plot in northern Japan. Seeds were collected using seed traps (n = 110) in the autumn of 1995, as well as directly from the AO layer of the soil, including leaf litter, intermediate, and humus layers (n = 110), in the spring of 1996. A total of 44075 seeds were disseminated into the seed traps, including 17 964 mature seeds; 15% of these were viable the following spring, indicating a large decrease in the abundance of viable seeds during the post-dispersal seed stage. Spatial association of undamaged seeds changed from a positive to independent association between the different dispersal stages, indicating rearrangement of the spatial pattern of seeds through time. During this period, numbers of living seeds generally decreased beneath nonspecific adults compared to those located away from the adults. This change resulted from the spatially different behavior of several biotic and abiotic killing agents. Rodents and fungi attacked the seeds, depending on seed densities and presence of nonspecific adult crowns, respectively, but desiccation was independent of both seed density and nonspecific crowns. The multiple killing agents with different spatial behavior jointly influenced the distributions of recruits entering tree populations.

TI  - Multiple natural enemies cause distance-dependent mortality at the seed-to-seedling transition.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Specialised natural enemies maintain forest diversity by reducing tree survival in a density- or distance-dependent manner. Fungal pathogens, insects and mammals are the enemy types most commonly hypothesised to cause this phenomenon. Still, their relative importance remains largely unknown, as robust manipulative experiments have generally targeted a single enemy type and life history stage. Here, we use fungicide, insecticide and physical exclosure treatments to isolate the impacts of each enemy type on two life history stages (germination and early seedling survival) in three tropical tree species. Distance dependence was evident for five of six species-stage combinations, with each enemy type causing distance dependence for at least one species stage and their importance varying widely between species and stages. Rather than implicating one enemy type as the primary agent of this phenomenon, our field experiments suggest that multiple agents acting at different life stages collectively contribute to this diversity-promoting mechanism.

TI  - Seed-predator satiation and Janzen-Connell effects vary with spatial scales for seed-feeding insects
PY  - 2016
AB  - Author(s): Xiao, Zhishu; Mi, Xiangcheng; Holyoak, Marcel; Xie, Wenhua; Cao, Ke; Yang, Xifu; Huang, Xiaoqun; Krebs, Charles J | Abstract: Background and aimsThe Janzen-Connell model predicts that common species suffer high seed predation from specialized natural enemies as a function of distance from parent trees, and consequently as a function of conspecific density, whereas the predator satiation hypothesis predicts that seed attack is reduced due to predator satiation at high seed densities. Pre-dispersal predation by insects was studied while seeds are still on parent trees, which represents a frequently overlooked stage in which seed predation occurs.MethodsReproductive tree density and seed production were investigated from ten Quercus serrata populations located in south-west China, quantifying density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation over two years by three insect groups.Key resultsAcorn infestation was nearly twice as high in the low-seed year as that in the high-seed year, with considerable spatio-temporal variation in the direction and magnitude of density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation evident. Across whole populations of trees, a high density of reproductive trees caused predator satiation and reduced insect attack in the high-seed year. Within individual trees, and consistent with the Janzen-Connell model, overall insect seed predation was positively correlated with seed production in the low-seed year. In addition, there was variation among insect taxa, with positive density-dependent seed predation by Curculio weevils in the high-seed year and moths in the low-seed year, but apparent density independence by Cyllorhynchites weevils in both years.ConclusionsThe overall trend of negative density-dependent, pre-dispersal seed predation suggests that predator satiation limited the occurrence of Janzen-Connell effects across Q. serrata populations. Such effects may have large impacts on plant population dynamics and tree diversity, depending on the extent to which they are reduced by counteracting positive density-dependent predation for seeds on individual trees and other factors affecting successful recruitment.

TI  - Effects of masting on seedling establishment of a rodent-dispersed tree species in a warm-temperate region, northern China.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Masting is an evolutionary strategy used by plants to promote seed survival and/or seed dispersal under animal predation, but its effects on seedling establishment in field condition are rarely tested by long-term experiments incorporating combined effects of seed and animal abundance. Here, we tracked seed production, rodent-mediated seed dispersal, and seedling establishment in Armeniaca sibirica from 2005 to 2014 in a warm-temperate forest in northern China, and examined the effects of seed abundance and per capita seed availability on seed fate and seedling recruitment rate. Our results showed that seed abundance or per capita seed availability generally benefited the seedling recruitment of A. sibirica through increasing dispersal intensity, supporting predator dispersal hypothesis. However, seedling recruitment showed satiated or even dome-shaped association with per capita seed availability, suggesting the benefit to trees would be decreased when seed abundance were too high as compared to rodent abundance (a satiated effect). Our results suggest that the predator dispersal and satiation effects of masting on seedling recruitment can operate together in one system and conditionally change with seed and animal abundance.

TI  - Seed bank dynamics: the role of fungal pathogens and climate change
PY  - 2000
AB  - 1. One of the climate change scenarios predicted for the UK is warmer winters and additional summer rainfall, which may favour growth and survival of fungal pathogens. We tested several hypotheses on the fate of persistent seeds in the soil and the role of fungal pathogens under this predicted climate change.

2. We buried seed bags containing fungicide-treated and non-fungicide-treated seeds of four species with persistent seed banks (Convolvulus arvensis L., Lotus corniculatus L., Medicago lupulina L. and Rubus fruticosus L.) under control and simulated climate change (winter warming plus supplemented summer rain) conditions, and monitored seed survival over 1 to 2 years.

3. Fungicide treatment resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of intact seeds recovered for only two of the four species, M. lupulina and R. fruticosus. Seeds of M. lupulina that were treated with fungicide remained viable in the soil for longer than non-treated seeds. Thus, the effect of fungal pathogens on seed persistence in the soil appears to be species specific.

4. There was no significant effect of the simulated climate (winter warming plus supplemented summer rain) on seed persistence in the soil, for any of the four species. Neither was a significant climate × fungicide treatment interaction found for any of the four species. Thus, it does not appear that the conditions provided in the simulated climate plots favoured the growth and survival of fungal pathogens affecting the soil seed banks of the four species studied here.

5. The use of fungicides in manipulative experiments and the importance of field experiments that simulate predicted climate change are discussed.

TI  - The Evolutionary ecology of seed size
PY  - 2000
AB  - Seed mass is a trait that occupies a pivotal position in the ecology of a species. It links the ecology of reproduction and seedling establishment with the ecology of vegetative growth, strategy sectors that are otherwise largely disconnected (Grime et al., 1988; Shipley et al., 1989; Leishman and Westoby, 1992). There is a startling diversity of shapes and sizes of seeds among the plant species of the world. Seeds range from the dust seeds of the Orchidaceae and some saprophytic and parasitic species (around 10 6 g), across ten orders of magnitude to the double coconut Lodoicea seychellarum (104 g) (Harper et al., 1970). Within species, seed size typically spans less than half an order of magnitude (about fourfold: Michaels et al., 1988). Most within-species variation occurs within plant rather than among plants or populations (Michaels et al., 1988; Obeso, 1993; Vaughton and Ramsey, 1998), indicating environmental effects during development rather than genetic differences between mothers. This chapter is concerned with the differences in seed size among species, and the consequences for vegetation dynamics and community composition. During the last 10–15 years, there has been considerable progress in the ecology of seed mass. Unlike many other areas of comparative plant ecology, we have substantial published information from several different scales and research styles. As well as field experiments and demographic studies with a few species at a time, we have simple experiments with larger numbers of species (ten to 50), quantification of seed mass and its correlates in whole-vegetation types (hundreds of species) and tests of consistency across different continents. The wide-scale quantification began as early as Salisbury (1942) and Baker (1972), but has been much added to and consolidated over the past 10 years (e.g. Mazer, 1989, 1990; Leishman and Westoby, 1994a; Leishman et al., 1995; Eriksson and Jakobsson, 1998). The work spanning large numbers of species is complementary to detailed experiments involving only a few species, giving a stronger sense of how widely the results from particular experiments can be generalized. Much of the literature examines how natural selection on seed size might be influenced by various environmental factors. In this context, it is at first glance surprising that seed size varies within communities across a remarkable five to six orders of magnitude (Leishman et al., 1995; Fig. 2.1). Further, there is strong overlap of seed-size distributions between quite different habitats. Within the temperate zone,

TI  - DIVERSITY, HOST AFFINITY, AND DISTRIBUTION OF SEED‐INFECTING FUNGI: A CASE STUDY WITH CECROPIA
PY  - 2007
AB  - Recruitment limitation has been proposed as an important mechanism contributing to the maintenance of tropical tree diversity. For pioneer species, infection by fungi significantly reduces seed survival in soil, potentially influencing both recruitment success and adult distributions. We examined fresh seeds of four sympatric Cecropia species for evidence of fungal infection, buried seeds for five months in common gardens below four C. insignis crowns in central Panama, and measured seed survival and fungal infection of inviable seeds. Seed survival varied significantly among species and burial sites, and with regard to local (Panama) vs. foreign (Costa Rica) maternal seed sources. Fresh seeds contained few cultivable fungi, but .80% of soil-incubated seeds were infected by diverse Ascomycota, including putative pathogens, saprophytes, and endophytes. From 220 isolates sequenced for the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), 26 of 73 unique genotypes were encountered more than once. Based on the most common genotypes, fungal communities demonstrate host affinity and are structured at the scale of individual crowns. Similarity among fungal communities beneath a given crown was significantly greater than similarity among isolates found under different crowns. However, the frequency of rare species suggests high fungal diversity and fine-scale spatial heterogeneity. These results reveal complex plant- fungal interactions in soil and provide a first indication of how seed survival in tropical forests may be affected by fungal community composition.

TI  - Interspecific variation in susceptibility to fungal pathogens in seeds of 10 tree species in the neotropical genus Cecropia
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. Species differences in susceptibility to pathogens acting at early life history stages may strongly influence the abundance and distribution of tropical trees. Here, we test the susceptibility of 10 congeners of the pioneer genus Cecropia to fungal seed and seedling pathogens and compare interspecific differences in intrinsic seed defences with survival. 2. Pathogens were experimentally removed through fungicide addition and ⁄ or autoclave sterilization of forest soil to determine the relative importance of fungal versus other microbial pathogens. Treatments were applied during a 4-month seed incubation (pre-emergence) phase or during an 8-week germination phase to distinguish between seed and seedling mortality. 3. Overall, seedling emergence after incubation in fungicide-treated, autoclaved soil was twice that in live soil, with significant positive effects of fungicide for six of 10 species. Pathogen infection occurred while seeds were quiescent in soil; fungicide addition during germination had no effect on emergence. Seedling emergence after burial ranged from 6 to 58%, indicating large interspecific variation in the capacity for Cecropia seeds to persist in the seed bank. Neither interspecific variation in survivorship, nor the relative strength of fungicide effects on survivorship was correlated with seed defence traits. 4. For four species, measurements of fungicide effects on emergence were coupled with direct measurements of the fungal and bacterial infection of seeds and seedlings. For two species, fungicide addition resulted in lower fungal infection rates and higher emergence success. However, Cecropia peltata, the species with the highest overall emergence success, also had the highest fungal infection rate. This suggests that either C. peltata was infected by a different suite of fungi than other congeners, or that fungi had low pathogenicity when colonizing this host species. 5. Synthesis. Our study shows strong interspecific variation in seed survival and susceptibility to fungal infection among congeneric tree species with similar life history. These differences are likely to influence recruitment success from the soil seed bank and may play a role in species coexistence.

TI  - Distance-dependent seedling mortality and long-term spacing dynamics in a neotropical forest community.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Negative distance dependence (NDisD), or reduced recruitment near adult conspecifics, is thought to explain the astounding diversity of tropical forests. While many studies show greater mortality at near vs. far distances from adults, these studies do not seek to track changes in the peak seedling curve over time, thus limiting our ability to link NDisD to coexistence. Using census data collected over 12 years from central Panama in conjunction with spatial mark-connection functions, we show evidence for NDisD for many species, and find that the peak seedling curve shifts away from conspecific adults over time. We find wide variation in the strength of NDisD, which was correlated with seed size and canopy position, but other life-history traits showed no relationship with variation in NDisD mortality. Our results document shifts in peak seedling densities over time, thus providing evidence for the hypothesized spacing mechanism necessary for diversity maintenance in tropical forests.

TI  - Short-term decline of Castanopsis fargesii adult trees promotes conspecific seedling regeneration: The complete process from seed production to seedling establishment.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Declining forests usually face uncertain regeneration dynamics and recovery trajectories, which are challenging to forest management. In this study, we investigated the decline pattern of Castanopsis fargesii and examined the effects on conspecific seedling regeneration. We found that 61.45% of adult individuals were in decline and the smaller DBH size classes of trees (10-40 cm) had a greater probability of decline. Most of the intermediate decline (94.52%) and nondecline individuals (95.23%) did not worsen, and the crowns of 21.91% of the intermediate decline trees were recovered during 2013-2018. Adult tree decline had a negative effect on seed production (mean mature seed density of nondecline, intermediate decline, and high decline individuals was 167.3, 63.3, and 2.1 seeds/m2, respectively), but no effect on key seed traits. The seed survival rate of declining trees was greater than that of nondeclining trees at both the seed production and seed dispersal stages. The seed to seedling transition rates in canopy gaps, decline habitats, and nondecline habitats were 7.94%, 9.47%, and 109.24%, respectively. The survival rate and height growth of newly germinated seedlings were positively correlated with the light condition, which was notably accelerated in the canopy gaps. Taken together, these results indicate that the reduction in seed production of some adult trees had a weakly negative effect on new seedling recruitment, while the improved environmental condition after the decline significantly enhanced the survival and growth of both advanced and new germinated seedlings. Looking at the overall life history, the short-term defoliation and mortality of some C. fargesii adult trees can be regarded as a natural forest disturbance that favors conspecific seedling regeneration. High-intensity management measures would be unnecessary in cases of an emerging intermediate decline in this forest.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we respond to a commentary by C. M. Moore and J. W. Dittel (‘On mutualism, models, and masting: the effects of seed‐dispersing animals on the plants they disperse’).

TI  - Conspecific and phylogenetic density-dependent survival differs across life stages in a tropical forest
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary
Ecologists have long recognized that plant performance is affected by the density and composition of neighbouring individuals. With the advent of highly resolved species-level phylogenies, it has become possible to test whether such density-dependent neighbourhood interactions are also phylogenetically dependent. Most studies of density dependence have focused on a single life stage; however, the relative importance of different neighbourhood interactions may shift over the lifetime of an individual.
We examined effects of conspecific neighbour density, heterospecific neighbour density and average phylogenetic relatedness of heterospecific neighbours on the survival of seedlings, saplings, juveniles and adult trees of 29 focal tree species using long-term, spatially explicit forest dynamics data and a highly resolved DNA barcode phylogeny from the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama.
Our results show a decline in the strength of conspecific negative density dependence across life stages: strong negative conspecific neighbour effects at early life stages gave way to weak positive conspecific neighbour effects for adult trees. In contrast, the effect of heterospecific neighbour density on survival showed no clear trend with life stage.
We found evidence of phylogenetic density dependence in the BCI forest, with a significant negative impact of neighbourhood relatedness on focal tree survival, but only for later life stages. In contrast to studies from other tropical forests, neighbourhood relatedness had a significant positive effect on seedling survival.
Furthermore, we found that focal species varied much more widely in their sensitivity to conspecific neighbour density than in their reactions to heterospecific neighbour density or phylogenetic relatedness.
Synthesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that both conspecific density dependence and phylogenetic density dependence influence tropical tree survival, but that their relative importance varies with life stage and among species. Our study highlights the need to incorporate multiple life stages and multiple species when assessing the factors contributing to individual survival and species coexistence for long-lived organisms.

TI  - Life-history trade-offs during the seed-to-seedling transition in a subtropical wet forest community
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. The transition from seed to established seedling (STS) represents a major bottleneck in plant demography with implications for community dynamics and the maintenance of species diversity. The relative strength of seed limitation versus seedling establishment limitation can reveal life-history trade-offs that contribute to the maintenance of community diversity. If seed limitation dominates, chance arrival to open sites may play a key role in maintaining diversity. If seedling establishment limitation dominates, however, species relative abundances may depend more on tolerance to environmental and biotic conditions during seedling establishment (i.e. species-specific regeneration niche). 2. We used three years of seed rain and seedling recruitment data for 19 species of tropical woody plants collected in the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot in Puerto Rico to (i) examine a trade-off between seed and seedling establishment limitation and (ii) quantify the biotic and abiotic factors that mediate the STS transition. 3. We did not find evidence of a life-history trade-off in the form of a negative correlation between seed and seedling establishment limitation. However, species varied considerably in the relative levels of seed and seedling establishment limitation they displayed. Seed mass correlated negatively with seedling establishment limitation but not with seed limitation. We found striking differences in STS transition between life-forms categorized as trees (including two palms) and lianas; lianas exhibited significantly higher STS transition rates than trees. 4. The biotic and abiotic variables most strongly associated with successful STS transition differed between life-forms. For trees, conspecific seed density and temporal fruiting concentration had negative effects on seedling establishment, while seed mass had a positive effect. A significant interaction between leaf litter input at a plot and seed size suggested that large-seeded species had higher STS transition probability in plots with more leaf litter biomass. This effect was reversed for smallseeded species. For lianas, leaf litter had a negative effect on STS transition and temporal fruiting concentration had a positive effect. 5. Synthesis. Our analyses demonstrate the multidimensional axes of regeneration niches and how they can be related to seed size. Long-term data sets are critical for understanding these relationships because the relevant factors vary along large spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Seed mass, seedling size and neotropical tree seedling establishment
PY  - 2005
AB  - 1- We examined among- and within-species effects of seed mass for seedling establishment from seed to 5 years of age in a field experiment at Paracou, French Guiana. 2- Six seeds of each of eight species were weighed and planted into each of 120 plots (1 m2) throughout closed-canopy forest along 12 100-m transects in 1998. 3- We described the microhabitat of each planting site using principal components derived from measurements of light availability, soil moisture, carbon and nitrogen content, and soil phosphorus availability. Although both survival and relative growth rate (RGR) increased with increasing light availability, no other microhabitat variable significantly affected seedling performance. Nor did the magnitude of microhabitat effects on survival or RGR differ among species. 4- Larger-seeded species were more likely to survive from germination to 1 year as well as from 1 to 5 years of age. RGR for seedling height during the first year post-germination was not related to seed mass, but smaller-seeded species did grow slightly faster thereafter. Path analyses revealed that correlations between seed mass and performance were explained in part because larger seeds produced larger initial seedlings, which tended to survive better but grow more slowly. 5- We also analysed within-species effects of seed mass for the larger-seeded Eperua grandiflora and Vouacapoua americana (both Caesalpiniaceae). Larger seeds produced larger seedlings in both species, but larger seeds survived better only for Eperua. Larger seedlings grew more slowly in both species, but did not offset the early (Eperua) and later (Vouacapoua) positive direct effects of seed mass on RGR that may represent contrasting strategies for reserve deployment. 6- Our results demonstrate that seed size influences performance within and among species in part because of indirect effects of initial seedling size. However, we suggest that traits tightly correlated with seed mass at the species level, such as specific leaf area, leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity, may also contribute to interspecific performance differences.

AB  - This paper presents a simple and widely ap- plicable multiple test procedure of the sequentially rejective type, i.e. hypotheses are rejected one at a tine until no further rejections can be done. It is shown that the test has a prescribed level of significance protection against error of the first kind for any combination of true hypotheses. The power properties of the test and a number of possible applications are also discussed.

TI  - Dry-forest tree species with large seeds and low stem specific density show greater survival under drought
PY  - 2019
AB  - Tree establishment in tropical dry forests is constrained by drought-related seedling mortality during early stages of recruitment. Predicted increases in the duration of growing-season droughts in the future pose a significant threat to these ecosystems that could significantly alter their vegetation structure and composition. Here, we examined drought tolerance in seedlings of seven common dry-forest tree species from the Indian subcontinent. We conducted a dry-down experiment on 3-wk-old seedlings, and asked whether the key plant functional traits, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), seed size and stem specific density (SSD) were good predictors of seedling growth under well-watered conditions, and survival during drought. Seedlings displayed substantial drought tolerance with most seedlings surviving for more than 2 wk under protracted drought. Seed size in combination with SLA predicted seedling growth under well-watered conditions and seed size predicted survival under drought. In contrast to our expectations, seedlings with lower SSD survived for longer without water. Our results suggest that dry-forest species will be differentially affected by the predicted increases in the duration of growing-season droughts, and detrimental effects will be more severe for species with smaller seeds.
