TI  - Seedling Density Dependence Promotes Coexistence of Bornean Rain Forest Trees
PY  - 1999
AB  - Density-dependent processes may occur at various spatial scales and may be generated by, and influence, various life stages in a population. When evaluating evidence for density dependence relevant to species coexistence, the nature of forest communities leads logically to a focus on particular scales and life stages. We assessed evidence for the dependence of seedling survival on the abundance of conspecific trees and seedlings over both wide (150-ha) and local (0.16-ha and 1-m2) scales, in a species-rich Bornean rain forest. At the 150-ha scale, we identified a community-level compensatory trend in seedling survival (i.e., more abundant species had higher seedling mortality). There were parallel trends at the population level and on a local scale; seedling survival was inversely related to conspecific seedling density (in 1-m2 quadrats) and tree basal area (in the surrounding 0.16 ha), for five out of 15 abundant species and for all species combined. As expected, seedlings of species with the highest adult abundance in 150 ha experienced the highest local densities of both conspecific seedlings and trees. Local density dependence in single-species analyses confirmed a dynamic interpretation of the community compensatory trend, i.e., that wide-scale seedling survival tends to decrease as a species’ adult abundance increases. Taken together, our findings constitute strong evidence that density-dependent processes contribute to coexistence in this diverse rain forest community.

TI  - Interactions between all pairs of neighboring trees in 16 forests worldwide reveal details of unique ecological processes in each forest, and provide windows into their evolutionary histories.
PY  - 2021
AB  - When Darwin visited the Galapagos archipelago, he observed that, in spite of the islands' physical similarity, members of species that had dispersed to them recently were beginning to diverge from each other. He postulated that these divergences must have resulted primarily from interactions with sets of other species that had also diverged across these otherwise similar islands. By extrapolation, if Darwin is correct, such complex interactions must be driving species divergences across all ecosystems. However, many current general ecological theories that predict observed distributions of species in ecosystems do not take the details of between-species interactions into account. Here we quantify, in sixteen forest diversity plots (FDPs) worldwide, highly significant negative density-dependent (NDD) components of both conspecific and heterospecific between-tree interactions that affect the trees' distributions, growth, recruitment, and mortality. These interactions decline smoothly in significance with increasing physical distance between trees. They also tend to decline in significance with increasing phylogenetic distance between the trees, but each FDP exhibits its own unique pattern of exceptions to this overall decline. Unique patterns of between-species interactions in ecosystems, of the general type that Darwin postulated, are likely to have contributed to the exceptions. We test the power of our null-model method by using a deliberately modified data set, and show that the method easily identifies the modifications. We examine how some of the exceptions, at the Wind River (USA) FDP, reveal new details of a known allelopathic effect of one of the Wind River gymnosperm species. Finally, we explore how similar analyses can be used to investigate details of many types of interactions in these complex ecosystems, and can provide clues to the evolution of these interactions.

TI  - Response to Comment on “Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale”
PY  - 2018
AB  - Chisholm and Fung claim that our method of estimating conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) in recruitment is systematically biased, and present an alternative method that shows no latitudinal pattern in CNDD. We demonstrate that their approach produces strongly biased estimates of CNDD, explaining why they do not detect a latitudinal pattern. We also address their methodological concerns using an alternative distance-weighted approach, which supports our original findings of a latitudinal gradient in CNDD and a latitudinal shift in the relationship between CNDD and species abundance.

TI  - Disentangling the effects of species interactions and environmental factors on the spatial pattern and coexistence of two congeneric Pinus species in a transitional climatic zone.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Congeneric species are critical for understanding the underlying ecological mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance. Ecological mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence, species differences in life-history stages related to habitat preference, and limiting similarity are known to influence plant fitness, thereby influencing species coexistence and biodiversity. However, our understanding of these phenomena as they apply to coexistence among coniferous species is limited. We studied two congeneric <i>Pinus</i> species, <i>Pinus armandii</i> (PA) and <i>Pinus tabulaeformis</i> (PT), both of which are common pioneer species typically succeeded by oaks (<i>Quercus</i>), in a 25-ha warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest. Here, we addressed the following questions: (1) How do population structures and distributions patterns of these two <i>Pinus</i> species vary with respect to different life-history stages? (2) Does intra- and interspecific competition vary with respect to three life-history stages? And (3) What are the relative contributions of topographic and soil variables to the spatial distributions of the species across the three life-history stages? In addressing these questions, we utilized the pair-correlation function g(r), redundancy analysis (RDA), variance partitioning (VP), and hierarchical partitioning (HP) to identify habitat preferences and conspecific negative density dependence at different life-history stages from small to large trees. The results revealed that in both <i>Pinus</i> species, individuals in different life-history stages were subject to significant habitat heterogeneity, with a tendency for small trees to be distributed at higher latitudes that may be represents climate-change-driven migration in both species. In addition, the effects of conspecific negative density dependence on PT were stronger than those on PA due to limited dispersal in PT. Furthermore, we found that interspecific competition was weak due to the species differences in resource utilization and preference for key habitats. Our study shows that congeneric <i>Pinus</i> species avoids competition by exploiting distinct habitats and provides insight into forest community structure.

TI  - Roles of Seed and Establishment Limitation in Determining Patterns of Afrotropical Tree Recruitment
PY  - 2013
AB  - Quantifying the relative importance of the multiple processes that limit recruitment may hold the key to understanding tropical tree diversity. Here we couple theoretical models with a large-scale, multi-species seed-sowing experiment to assess the degree to which seed and establishment limitation shape patterns of tropical tree seedling recruitment in a central African forest. Of five randomly selected species (Pancovia laurentii, Staudtia kamerunensis, Manilkara mabokeensis, Myrianthus arboreas, and Entandophragma utile), seedling establishment and survival were low (means of 16% and 6% at 3 and 24 months, respectively), and seedling density increased with seed augmentation. Seedling recruitment was best explained by species identity and the interaction of site-by-species, suggesting recruitment probabilities vary among species and sites, and supporting the role of niche-based mechanisms. Although seed augmentation enhanced initial seedling density, environmental filtering and post-establishment mortality strongly limited seedling recruitment. The relative importance of seed and establishment limitation changed with seed and seedling density and through time. The arrival of seeds most strongly affected local recruitment when seeds were nearly absent from a site (∼ 1 seed m(2)), but was also important when seeds arrived in extremely high densities, overwhelming niche-based mortality factors. The strength of seed limitation and density-independent mortality decreased significantly over time, while density-dependent mortality showed the opposite trend. The varying strengths of seed and establishment limitation as a function of juvenile density and time emphasize the need to evaluate their roles through later stages of a tree's life cycle.

TI  - Enemies mediate distance- and density-dependent mortality of tree seeds and seedlings: a meta-analysis of fungicide, insecticide and exclosure studies.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is often assumed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides and exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that distance- and density-dependent mortality caused by natural enemies was most likely at the seedling stage and was greater at higher mean annual temperatures. Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence at the seedling stage is significantly weakened when fungicides were applied. By contrast, negative conspecific distance- and density-dependence is not a general pattern at the seed stage. High seed mass reduced distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seed stage. Seed studies excluding only large mammals found significant negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality, but exclusion of all mammals resulted in a non-significant effect of conspecifics. Our study suggests that plant pathogens are a major cause of distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seedling stage, while the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.

TI  - Parental Effects on Spatial Patterns of Plants: A Contingency Table Approach
PY  - 1989
AB  - We examined the effects of plant size and seed production on the seed shadows and mature offspring patterns of isolated parent plants of six biotypes of Panicum miliaceum. Spatial patterns of offspring were summarized in contingency tables that were classified by distance and orientation from the parent. These tables were analyzed with reciprocal averaging ordination and dispersion profile analysis. The first and second com- ponents of the ordination of a detailed data set reflected the distance and orientation, respectively, of the seed shadows from their parents. The mean infructescence height and the mean lateral spread of the parent plants were correlated with the first component of the ordination while the orientation of the parent plants was correlated with the second component. Little support was found for the hypothesis that biotypes with high numbers of seeds produced should have greater dispersal ability. However, when the individuals were grouped by seed production, irrespective of biotype, the more fecund groups had more distant cohorts of mature offspring. This latter trend was partly attributable to the increased density-dependent mortality near fecund parent plants and partly attributable to the larger sizes and hence larger seed shadows of these parents.

                  <jats:p>The importance of density-dependent mortality in maintaining tree species diversity is widely accepted. However, density-dependent effects may vary in magnitude and direction with different abiotic conditions in forests.

                  <jats:p>The seedling dynamics analysis revealed that the strength of density-dependent effects increased with AN, shifting from neutral or positive with low AN to negative with high AN. Three of the five tree species had stronger density-dependent effects on root lesions in rich AN environments than in poor AN environments, which is consistent with the results of a long-term seedling dynamics analysis. We also found higher species diversity in rich AN environments, which may be promoted by the stronger negative density-dependent effects. Both the seedling dynamic analysis and root lesion detection experiment revealed stronger negative density-dependent effects in higher AN environment, resulting from stronger disease pressure by soil pathogens. Our study emphasized the importance of considering context dependence when testing the density dependence hypotheses.</jats:p>

TI  - Scale‐dependent effects of conspecific negative density dependence and immigration on biodiversity maintenance
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) has been highlighted as a main driver of biodiversity maintenance. However, while there is general consensus on the scale‐dependent and interacting nature of ecological processes, there is limited knowledge about the relative importance of CNDD across spatial scales and on its interaction with other processes, such as dispersal and immigration. While many studies have detected CNDD at local scales, it remains unknown whether its effects on biodiversity maintenance scale‐up to landscapes and regions. Here, we use a generic dynamic and spatially‐explicit simulation model to assess the interacting relative effects of local‐scale CNDD and immigration from a metacommunity for biodiversity maintenance across spatial scales. For this purpose, we systematically varied immigration rates, the average strength and the variation of CNDD among species. We found that CNDD only determined species richness in strongly isolated communities with little or no interspecific variation in CNDD. In closed communities, plausible interspecific variation in CNDD led to a strong reduction in species richness. In open communities, realistic levels of immigration overwhelmed the effects of CNDD on diversity maintenance. From these results, we suggest that local CNDD is unlikely to be a main driver of biodiversity in real communities, especially at larger spatial scales. This study provides a first step towards improved integration of local‐scale coexistence theory with large‐scale metacommunity theory and highlights the importance of considering the interacting and scale‐dependent nature of ecological processes.</jats:p>

TI  - Seasonal variation of environment and conspecific density-dependence effects on early seedling growth of a tropical tree in semi-arid savannahs
PY  - 2023
AB  - Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain species coexistence and maintainance of local species diversity in tree communities. Among the proposed mechanisms, negative density dependence theory (NDD) predicts that seedling growth rate declines at high conspecific densities. However, local environmental conditions and seasonality may also modulate the strength of NDD. We used data from dry and wet seasons in West African semi-arid savannas to explore the importance of NDD and environmental heterogeneity in predicting seedling growth of Afzelia africana Sm, a threatened species with high economic and cutural values. First, we analysed variation of seedling growth in dry and wet seasons, and between vegetation types (tree and shrub savannas). Next, we assessed the effects of environmental heterogeneity (soil type, slope and elevation) and biotic factors (conspecific/heterospecific seedling and adult densities, leaf fungal infection, herbivory) on seedling growth in dry and wet seasons, while controlling for initial seedling size. We predicted that seedling growth would be higher in the wet than in the dry season, and in shrub savannas than in tree savannas due to variation in stand density and intensity of competitive biotic interactions. We also hypothesized that slope and negative density dependence would influence seedling growth and that, the density-dependent effects would vary with environmental heterogeneity and seasonality. Results showed two distinct patterns of seedling growth primarily driven by seasonality: a higher growth rate in the wet season due to water availability and a smaller growth rate during the dry season, possibly because seedlings develop adaptation to drought and fire at the expense of their growth. Growth rate was also higher on flat and gentle slope. Density-dependent effects on seedling growth were only observed with conspecific adults. Seasonality modulated the strength of the density-dependent effect, which was significantly negative in the wet season and nonsignificant in the dry season. This study suggests that A. africana early seedling growth is modulated by interacting effects of seasonality, terrain slope and adult conspecific density. Campaigns for reforestation with A. africana in the semi-arid areas will require increased attention on the seedlings during the long periods of drought.

TI  - Conspecific negative density dependence decreases with increasing species abundance
PY  - 2015
AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is often involved in explaining the maintenance of species diversity in forest communities given that it may suppress the common species. Recent studies, in contrast, suggested that CNDD had a stronger effect on rare species than on common species and thus shaped the current tree abundance pattern. However, this finding was obtained mainly in the tropical forest and mixed results also occurred in the similar area. In addition, experimental test of the role of soil biota in maintaining this relationship is rare. In this study, two parallel manipulative shade-house and field experiments were conducted in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest to test whether abundant species showed weaker CNDD than rarer species and whether susceptibility to soil biota was sufficient to maintain this relationship. The shade-house experiment provided strong evidence for negative density-dependent effects, and the strength of the density effect was significantly decreased along with the increase of the tree abundance. In the field experiment, a similar result was obtained. The density effect did not correlate with tree abundance after the sterilized treatment in the shade-house experiment and the fungicide treatment in the field. Our results indicated that CNDD was negatively corrected with tree abundance in this subtropical forest and that soil biota played an important role in maintaining the relationship.

TI  - Testing the Janzen‐Connell mechanism: pathogens cause overcompensating density dependence in a tropical tree
PY  - 2010
AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis is a leading explanation for plant-species diversity in tropical forests. It suggests that specialized natural enemies decrease offspring survival at high densities beneath parents, giving locally rarer species an advantage. This mechanism, in its original form, assumes that density dependence is overcompensating: mortality must be disproportionately high at the highest densities, with few offspring recruiting below their parents. We tested this assumption using parallel shadehouse and field density-series experiments on seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis. We found strong, overcompensating mortality driven by fungal pathogens, causing 90% (shadehouse) or 100% (field) mortality within 4 weeks of germination, and generating a negative relationship between initial and final seedling densities. Fungicide treatment led to much lower, density-independent, mortality. Overcompensating mortality was extremely rapid, and could be missed without detailed monitoring. Such dynamics may prevent dead trees from being replaced by conspecifics, promoting coexistence as envisioned by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

TI  - Fruit sizes and the structure of frugivorous communities in a New Guinea lowland rainforest
PY  - 2016
AB  - A community of frugivorous insects was studied by rearing of 25 565 individual insects representing three orders (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera except Drosophilidae) from 326 woody plant species in a lowland rainforest in Papua New Guinea. Fruits from 19.3% of plant species were not attacked by any insect order, 33.4% of plant species were attacked by a single order, 30% by two orders and 17.2% by all three orders. The likelihood of attack by individual orders was positively correlated so that a higher proportion of plant species than expected suffered either no attack at all or was attacked by all three insect orders. Fruits from most of the plant species exhibited low rates of attack and low densities of insects. One kilogram of fruit was attacked on average by 11 insects, including three to four Coleoptera, six Diptera and one Lepidoptera. Thus, we reared on average one insect from 10 fruits, including one Diptera from 14 fruits, one Coleoptera from 22 fruits and one Lepidoptera from 100 fruits. Only 72 out of the 326 plant species hosted more than one insect per 10 fruits, and only seven species supported a density of greater than one insect per fruit. Our results suggest that specialized insect seed predators are probably too rare to maintain the diversity of vegetation by density-dependent mortality of seeds as suggested by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis. Fruit weight, fruit volume, mesocarp volume, seed volume and fleshiness had no significant effect on the probability that a fruit would be attacked by an insect frugivore. However, fruits attacked by Diptera were significantly larger and had larger volume of both mesocarp and seeds than fruits attacked by Coleoptera and Lepidoptera.

2To identify the mechanisms responsible for these patterns the population dynamics of P. ilicis were studied during an 8-year period on 92 host trees in 15 holly patches. The patterns of oviposition, mining and survival and the dominant sources and rates of mortality were monitored. The impact of tree and patch parameters on leaf-miner population dynamics was analysed, and the dispersal ability of P. ilicis was evaluated experimentally.
3Infestation differences among trees were due to host selection, which determined egg numbers on individual trees and was explained partly by holly variety and leaf availability.
4Egg distributions on medium to highly infested host trees were aggregated, suggesting limits in the availability of young leaves for oviposition.
5Due to a suite of mortality factors mean survival rates of P. ilicis were below 10% and did not show a relationship with host choice.
6There was strongly density-dependent pre-mine mortality most probably caused by intraspecific competition in the leaf midrib. This lead to the formation of a single mine on most leaves. There was a weak density-dependent effect of mine density on miscellaneous larval death and on the attack rates of the larval parasitoid Chrysocaris gemma.
7In the holly leaf-miner system phenology effects set a population ceiling delimited by the availability of oviposition sites. The resulting egg distribution determined the impact of density-dependent intraspecific competition in the leaf midrib. The incidence of larval competition was therefore not a function of density per se, but density-relative to the availability of a limiting resource, namely suitable young leaves for oviposition.

TI  - Vertebrate herbivory impacts seedling recruitment more than niche partitioning or density-dependent mortality.
PY  - 2012
AB  - In tropical forests, resource-based niches and density-dependent mortality are mutually compatible mechanisms that can act simultaneously to limit seedling populations. Differences in the strengths of these mechanisms will determine their roles in maintaining species coexistence. In the first assessment of these mechanisms in a Congo Basin forest, we quantified their relative strengths and tested the extent to which density-dependent mortality is driven by the distance-dependent behavior of seed and seedling predators predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We conducted a large-scale seed addition experiment for five randomly selected tropical tree species, caging a subset of seed addition quadrats against vertebrate predators. We then developed models to assess the mechanisms that determine seedling emergence (three months after seed addition) and survival (two years after seed addition). As predicted, both niche differentiation and density-dependent mortality limited seedling recruitment, but predation had the strongest effects on seedling emergence and survival. Seedling species responded differently to naturally occurring environmental variation among sites, including variation in light levels and soil characteristics, supporting predictions of niche-based theories of tropical tree species coexistence. The addition of higher densities of seeds into quadrats initially led to greater seedling emergence, but survival to two years decreased with seed density. Seed and seedling predation reduced recruitment below levels maintained by density-dependent mortality, an indication that predators largely determine the population size of tree seedlings. Seedling recruitment was unrelated to the distance to or density of conspecific adult trees, suggesting that recruitment patterns are generated by generalist vertebrate herbivores rather than the specialized predators predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. If the role of seed and seedling predation in limiting seedling recruitment is a general phenomenon, then the relative abundances of tree species might largely depend on species-specific adaptations to avoid, survive, and recover from damage induced by vertebrate herbivores. Likewise, population declines of herbivorous vertebrate species (many of which are large and hunted) may trigger shifts in species composition of tropical forests.

TI  - The distance dependence prediction of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis: a meta-analysis
PY  - 2003
AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis explains the maintenance of tropical diversity through the interacting effects of parent-centered dispersal patterns and distance- and density-dependent propagule survival. These effects were thought to support regular spacing of species within tropical forest, enhancing diversity. One of the predictions of the hypothesis is that seed and seedling survival should improve with increased parental distance. Although there are many independent tests of this hypothesis for individual species, there are few synthetic studies that have brought these data together to test its validity across species. This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of the effect of distance on enhancing propagule survival, employing an odds-ratio effect size metric. We found no general support for the distance-dependent prediction of the hypothesis, and conclude that further testing to explore this hypothesis as a diversity-maintaining mechanism is unnecessary. However, we did find that distance from parent slightly reduces survivorship in the temperate zone, as contrasted with the tropics, and we saw stronger evidence in support of the hypothesis for seedlings than for seeds. The phenomenon of enhanced propagule survival with distance from the parent may be important for the population biology of particular species, but it is not a general phenomenon across communities, life history stages or life forms.

TI  - A simple mechanistic model of seed dispersal, predation and plant establishment: Janzen‐Connell and beyond
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary


1
Although, in nature, seed dispersal usually declines with distance from the source, seedling establishment patterns are highly variable. An increase in seed survival can lead to either hump-shaped (Janzen-Connell (J-C) pattern) or declining (Hubbell pattern) establishment with distance from seed source, but declining establishment can also be generated if survival decreases with distance (McCanny pattern). Pathogens and seed predators are considered to be major mortality agents structuring recruitment patterns, but it is unclear how well predation alone can explain variation in these patterns.

2
We introduce a simple mechanistic model showing that distance and density-dependent seed predation can generate all of the observed recruitment patterns. Our approach provides the first mathematical reconstruction of conceptual models previously considered to be based on contrasting underlying mechanisms. Three easily measurable quantities (the proportion of seeds escaping predation at the source, and the mean distance from the source of dispersed seeds and of predators’ activity) can be used to test for consistency with the J-C pattern. The association between recruitment patterns and plant (dispersal) and animal (predation) characteristics is robust with respect to parameter values and various functional forms.

3
The model shows that the J-C pattern can occur only if the mean distance over which predators are active is lower than that over which seeds are dispersed, corresponding to a system with host-specific, or immobile, seed predators (often invertebrates) that are restricted to areas of high seed density near adult plants, and therefore selecting for longer dispersal distances of seeds.

4
The Hubbell pattern is generated by the model when dispersal and predation distances are of equivalent magnitudes. The McCanny pattern emerges if more generalized, or more mobile, seed predators (often vertebrates) are attracted to the adult trees but also tend to forage farther away, thereby selecting for short dispersal distances that generate high densities needed to satiate seed predators.

5
The model also predicts that the total number of seeds surviving predation is lowest at intermediate distances, suggesting that distance-dependent predation promotes either short or long dispersal distances, or both (dimorphism).

TI  - On mutualism, models, and masting: The effects of seed‐dispersing animals on the plants they disperse
PY  - 2020
AB  - Species interactions are context dependent, in that their direction and magnitude can vary across ecological conditions. For seed dispersal interactions—especially interactions between plants and seed‐caching animals—the direction of the interactions is often obscured because of seed mortality inherent in seed handling and the delayed effects of fitness benefits received by plants. It is, therefore, an open question in ecology to understand the ecological contexts under which seed dispersal interactions are facilitative, antagonistic or null. We review the fitness benefits of animal‐mediated seed dispersal, extend a recently published model to include negative density‐dependent effects, and review the feedback between seed production (with a focus on masting) and seed‐caching animal populations. Negative density‐dependent effects are pervasive and strongly affect the direction of plant‐seed‐disperser interactions, and including them into models will give a more accurate understanding of the direction of the interaction. Including negative density‐dependent effects also makes the interpretation of interaction more mutualistic since seed dispersers decrease seed densities. Additionally, there is substantial interannual variability in seed production in most nut‐producing plant species, and the lags between seed production and seed‐disperser population sizes complicate and limit inferences made about the direction of interactions in any given short‐term study. Synthesis. If we wish to know the direction of species interactions in real ecological communities, we need models that contain a minimum level of biological realism. For complex and long‐term phenomena such as context‐dependent species interactions we should embrace a multifaceted approach of short‐term field research, long‐term field research, simple models, and complex models to form a more robust understanding of the ecological problem of context dependency.

TI  - The devil to pay: a cost of mutualism with Myrmelachista schumanni ants in 'devil's gardens' is increased herbivory on Duroia hirsuta trees.
PY  - 2007
AB  - ‘Devil’s gardens’ are nearly pure stands of the myrmecophyte, Duroia hirsuta, that occur in Amazonian rainforests. Devil’s gardens are created by Myrmelachista schumanni ants, which nest in D. hirsuta trees and kill other plants using formic acid as an herbicide. Here, we show that this ant–plant mutualism has an associated cost; by making devil’s gardens, M. schumanni increases herbivory on D. hirsuta. We measured standing leaf herbivory on D. hirsuta trees and found that they sustain higher herbivory inside than outside devil’s gardens. We also measured the rate of herbivory on nursery-grown D. hirsuta saplings planted inside and outside devil’s gardens in ant-exclusion and control treatments. We found that when we excluded ants, herbivory on D. hirsuta was higher inside than outside devil’s gardens. These results suggest that devil’s gardens are a concentrated resource for herbivores. Myrmelachista schumanni workers defend D. hirsuta against herbivores, but do not fully counterbalance the high herbivore pressure in devil’s gardens. We suggest that high herbivory may limit the spread of devil’s gardens, possibly explaining why devil’s gardens do not overrun Amazonian rainforests.

TI  - Seedling survival declines with increasing conspecific density in a common temperate tree
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Feedbacks between plants and their soil microbial communities often drive negative density dependence in rare, tropical tree species, but their importance to common, temperate trees remains unclear. Additionally, whether negative density dependence is driven by natural enemies (e.g., soil pathogens) or by high densities of seedlings has rarely been assessed. Density dependence may also depend on seedling size, as smaller and/or younger seedlings may be more susceptible to mortality agents. We monitored seedlings of <jats:italic>Quercus rubra</jats:italic>, a common, canopy‐dominant temperate tree, to investigate how the density of neighboring adults and seedlings influenced their survival over two years. We assessed how the soil microbial community influenced seedling survival by growing seedlings in a glasshouse inoculated with soil collected from beneath conspecific and heterospecific mature trees. In the field, seedling survival was lower in areas with high densities of mature conspecifics but was unrelated to either conspecific or heterospecific seedling density. Smaller seedlings were also more sensitive than larger seedlings to neighboring adult conspecifics. In the glasshouse, seedlings grown with soil from beneath a conspecific adult had a higher mortality rate than seedlings grown with soil from beneath heterospecific adults or sterilized soil, suggesting that soil microbial communities drive the patterns of mortality in the field. These results illustrate the importance of negative density‐dependent feedbacks resulting from the soil microbial community in a common and ecologically important temperate tree species.</jats:p>

TI  - Predation of beech seed by mice: Effects of numerical and functional responses
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary 1. The functional response of post-dispersal seed predators (house mouse, Mus musculus ) to absolute densities of southern beech seed ( Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides ) was studied in laboratory and field trials. House mice showed a Type II (hyperbolic) functional response to seed availability and this was not modified by the presence of an alternative food source. 2. Maximum daily intake rate of beech seeds during field trials averaged 1042 seeds mouse − 1 . This is sufficient to provide house mice with both the energy and protein required for growth and reproduction. 3. We explicitly incorporated the functional response into the numerical response of house mice to beech seed, measured for field populations monitored in a New Zealand beech forest. House mice showed a strong numerical response to beech seed intake rate that was modified by some density-dependent mechanism(s). 4. We developed a model that simulated seedfall, house mouse population growth and seed reserve depletion over one year. We found that the previously reported decline in house-mouse populations in beech forests during spring and summer is likely to be related to spring beech seed germination that renders seed no longer available as a food source for house mice. 5. From our simulation model it does not appear that house-mouse populations can completely eat-out beech seed reserves prior to germination in a year of large seedfall. ‘Masting’ behaviour in New Zealand native beech trees is therefore sufficient to satiate an eruptive population of an exotic mammalian omnivore, despite the lack of a long co-evolutionary interaction.

TI  - A spatially explicit model of sapling growth in a tropical forest: does the identity of neighbours matter?
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary 1 We quantified neighbourhood effects on sapling growth for 60 tree species in the 50-ha plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Additionally, we tested whether target sapling growth responds to taxonomic or functional identity of neighbouring species by comparing four alternate models (that all neighbours have equivalent effects on the target; that conspecific and heterospecific neighbours have distinct effects; that heterospecific neighbours can be divided into confamilials and non-confamilials; and that they can be divided according to their response to light availability). 2 Over half of the species (34 out of 60) analysed were consistent with all neighbours having equivalent effects on the target. This may result from diffuse evolution allowing tolerance of a large number of neighbouring species or could be a statistical artefact of over-clumping species into large neighbour groups (e.g. heterospecific neighbours). 3 Other species supported models that differentiated between conspecific and heterospecific ( n = 6) or between confamilial vs. non-confamilial ( n = 5) neighbours and, in general, effects of neighbours were stronger if they were more closely related to the target. Where target species differentiated between neighbours from different light guilds ( n = 15), effects were stronger if both belonged to the same guild (i.e. both gap requiring or both shade tolerant). 4 Despite the fact that the majority of species did not respond to the identity of neighbours, all differed in their response to the degree of crowding. Our results suggest that the response of target species to crowding, rather than individual species effects on targets, may be subject to selection. 5 Variation among species in response to crowding or to the identity of neighbouring species is likely to contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests.

TI  - Environmental context alters the magnitude of conspecific negative density dependence in a temperate forest
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is an important driver of stand‐level tree diversity in temperate forests. CNDD can occur via two main processes. First, soil pathogens and herbivores form a halo of high enemy density surrounding established trees at local spatial scales. As a result, seedlings and saplings residing within this halo experience reduced growth and survival. Second, intraspecific competition can lead to local depletion of resources, reducing the performance of conspecific seedlings and saplings, and encouraging spatial mixing of tree species. While seedlings and saplings respond to nearby conspecific adults, they are simultaneously responding to local environmental conditions. Solar radiation, soil moisture, and soil nutrients can all influence tree recruitment patterns. Furthermore, these environmental factors can influence densities and activities of soil pathogens, as well as seedling and sapling carbon balance. As a result, we expect small‐scale variation in the abiotic environment to influence the magnitude of CNDD, although this expectation has thus far received little attention. We combined tree stem and environmental data from a mapped oak‐hickory forest plot to evaluate whether the local environment modulates the direction or magnitude of negative density dependence. We tested for the interaction between conspecific and heterospecific basal area within a sapling's neighborhood and each of five environmental covariates: index of canopy gaps, soil organic matter, soil cations, topographic curvature, and topographic slope/aspect. We found that increasing local conspecific and heterospecific basal areas reduced sapling growth and that the conspecific basal area reduced sapling growth more so than did heterospecific basal area. Furthermore, we observed significant interactions between adult tree density and all environmental covariates that differed depending on the category of nearby adults (i.e., conspecific vs. heterospecific), and this effect was most important with variations in soil organic matter, soil cations, and topographic slope/aspect. We conclude that tree basal area not only interacts with environmental conditions to influence sapling growth, but more importantly, that small‐scale environmental conditions interact with the density of nearby conspecifics to modulate sapling growth. Thus, if this result proves general, a central mechanism underlying the maintenance of diversity can be modified by small‐scale environmental conditions.</jats:p>

TI  - Incorporating the effects of generalist seed predators into plant community theory
PY  - 2017
AB  - Post-dispersal seed predators contribute substantially to seed loss across many ecosystems. Most research has focused on understanding sources of variation in seed loss, without appreciating the implications of seed predation for plant coexistence, community assembly and broader community theory. Meanwhile, research aimed at understanding coexistence and community assembly processes in plant communities has focused on axes of dispersal and resource competition and the traits influencing these processes, without accounting for the role of generalist seed predators.
We review the unique features of post-dispersal seed predation and assess the implications of seed loss on three critical components of plant community organization˗ coexistence, community structure and plant invasions ˗ pointing to both important gaps in theory and empirical knowledge. We highlight how understanding fundamental controls on plant recruitment is central to determining how seed predation affects plant recruitment and coexistence. We discuss how accounting for seed predator foraging strategies may shift trait-based inferences of community assembly.
Synthesis. We argue that seed predation by generalist consumers, which is pervasive in temperate communities, should be better incorporated into plant community theory. Experiments that specifically incorporate the presence and attributes of the seed predator community and that follow seed fate would fill important knowledge gaps. Particularly needed are studies focused on strengthening the connections between seed removal and plant establishment and linking selective and density dependent foraging strategies to plant traits. Advancing our understanding of the processes regulating plant coexistence and community assembly requires that future research not only acknowledge but incorporate generalist consumers’ effects on plant communities.

TI  - Rare and phylogenetically distinct plant species exhibit less diverse root‐associated pathogen communities
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>One of the central questions in ecology is why some species are abundant while others are rare. In plant communities, some studies show that rare plant species are rare because they suffer stronger negative density‐dependent effects from pathogens compared to abundant plant species. Moreover, such pathogen effects are also suggested to be related to phylogenetic distance among plant species. However, the importance of pathogens has been commonly inferred by treating the entire pathogen community as a “black box” without explicitly characterizing pathogen richness and community composition.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we test two predictions. First, if rare plant species are more susceptible to pathogens, we predict that rare plant species are associated with a higher richness of specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack only a single plant species) and/or the total pathogen community. If phylogenetically distinct plant species are less susceptible to pathogens, we predict that plant species with higher phylogenetic distinctiveness (i.e., a measure of how phylogenetically distant a species is from other co‐occurring species) are associated with a lower richness of phylogenetic specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack closely related plant species) and/or the total pathogen community.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We conducted a survey of the root‐associated pathogen communities from 45 plant species in a subtropical forest. We showed that approximately 40% and 25% of the pathogens were specialists and phylogenetic specialists respectively. In contrast to our first prediction, the richness of the total pathogen community but not the richness of the specialists was found to be positively related to plant species abundance, indicating that rare plant species suffer less from pathogens. Consistent with our second prediction, both the richness of the phylogenetic specialists and the total pathogen community were found to be negatively related to plant species phylogenetic distinctiveness. Furthermore, these correlations were stronger at the earlier plant life stages examined.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis.</jats:italic> We found that the root‐associated pathogen communities were less diverse in rare plant species and plant species with few close relatives. These associations varied across multiple plant life stages, suggesting that the strength of the above‐ground–below‐ground interactions change dynamically across plant life span.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Janzen-Connell effects in a broadcast-spawning Caribbean coral: distance-dependent survival of larvae and settlers
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis states that host-specific biotic enemies (pathogens and predators) promote the coexistence of tree species in tropical forests by causing distance- or density-dependent mortality of seeds and seedlings. Although coral reefs are the aquatic analogues of tropical forests, the Janzen-Connell model has never been proposed as an explanation for high diversity in these ecosystems. We tested the central predictions of the Janzen-Connell model in a coral reef, using swimming larvae and settled polyps of the common Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata. In a field experiment to test for distance- or density-dependent mortality, coral settler mortality was higher and more strongly density dependent in locations down-current from adult corals. Survival did not increase monotonically with distance, however, revealing the influence of fluid dynamics around adult corals in structuring spatial patterns of mortality. Complementary microbial profiles around adult coral heads revealed that one potential cause of settler mortality, marine microbial communities, are structured at the same spatial scale. In a field experiment to test whether factors causing juvenile mortality are host specific, settler mortality was 2.3-3.0 times higher near conspecific adults vs. near adult corals of other genera or in open reef areas. In four laboratory experiments to test for distance-dependent, host-specific mortality, swimming coral larvae were exposed to water collected near conspecific adult corals, near other coral genera, and in open areas of the reef. Microbial abundance in these water samples was manipulated with filters and antibiotics to test whether the cause of mortality was biotic (i.e., microbial). Juvenile survivorship was lowest in unfiltered water collected near conspecifics, and survivorship increased when this water was filter sterilized, collected farther away, or collected near other adult coral genera. Together these results demonstrate for the first time that the diversity-promoting mechanisms embodied in the Janzen-Connell model can operate in a marine ecosystem and in an animal. The distribution of adult corals across a reef will thus influence the spatial pattern of juvenile survival. When rare coral species have a survival advantage, coral species diversity per se becomes increasingly important for the persistence and recovery of coral cover on tropical reefs.

TI  - Effects of plant interactions on the populations of the endangered <i>Fagus pashanica</i>
PY  - 2022
AB  - Background Examining the spatial patterns of species distributions and their underlying processes is important for characterising population dynamics and can provide novel insights for conservation management. However, little attention has been paid to spatial distribution patterns of endangered species.Aims We quantified the effects of plant interactions and environmental heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of endangered Fagus pashanica in communities, to reveal the processes which may account for its population dynamics.Methods We collected spatial coordinates of each tree in communities at three elevations and evaluated the effects of plant interactions and environmental heterogeneity using point pattern analysis.Results Dispersal limitation rather than habitat filtering shaped the spatial patterns of F. pashanica at all three elevations. Intraspecific competition in F. pashanica was found to be significant at middle- and high elevations; interspecific interactions were not significant at any of the three elevations.Conclusions Intraspecific competition significantly affected the spatial patterns of F. pashanica. Dispersal limitation appear to lead to aggregation, while at small spatial scales intraspecific interactions are likely to decrease aggregation due to potential density-dependent thinning effects.

TI  - Native insect herbivory overwhelms context dependence to limit complex invasion dynamics of exotic weeds
PY  - 2017
AB  - Understanding the role of consumers in density-dependent plant population dynamics is a long-standing goal in ecology. However, the generality of herbivory effects across heterogeneous landscapes is poorly understood due to the pervasive influence of context-dependence. We tested effects of native insect herbivory on the population dynamics of an exotic thistle, Cirsium vulgare, in a field experiment replicated across eight sites in eastern Nebraska. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis and density-dependent population models, we found potential for explosive low-density population growth (λ > 5) and complex density fluctuations under herbivore exclusion. However, herbivore access drove population decline (λ < 1), suppressing complex fluctuations. While plant–herbivore interaction outcomes are famously context-dependent, we demonstrated that herbivores suppress potentially invasive populations throughout our study region, and this qualitative outcome is insensitive to environmental context. Our novel use of Bayesian demographic modelling shows that native insect herbivores consistently prevent hard-to-predict fluctuations of weeds in environments otherwise susceptible to invasion.

TI  - Seed traits, not density or distance from parent, determine seed predation and establishment in an Afrotropical forest
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Seed predators drive patterns in seed mortality and seedling establishment and are posited to contribute to the maintenance of plant species diversity through several mechanisms. Negative density dependence and spatially restricted recruitment are apparently widespread in Neotropical forests, but are little studied in Afrotropical forests, where generalist vertebrates may contribute more to seed mortality than do specialized invertebrates and fungi. We experimentally assessed the roles of seed density and distance from the parent tree for ten tree species in a forest in northeastern Gabon, using exclosures to isolate the effects of different seed predator types. Vertebrates caused greater seed losses than all other mortality agents combined. Unexpectedly, seeds under fruiting conspecific trees had significantly lower removal and higher seedling establishment than those under heterospecific trees or in neutral non‐fruiting locations. Seed density did not significantly affect seedling establishment. Vertebrate seed removal ranged from 0 percent to 100 percent among focal species and was positively correlated with seed mass but had no relationship with species commonness (adult tree density). Seed traits strongly affected patterns of seed removal and seedling establishment and may contribute more to the likelihood of success for an individual seed than do its density or distance from parent. Our results highlight an apparent divergence in patterns of seed mortality and seedling establishment between tropical forest regions and emphasize the need for further comparative study.</jats:p>

TI  - How many seeds does it take to make a sapling
PY  - 2014
AB  - Tall canopy trees produce many more seeds than do understory treelets, yet, on average, both classes of trees achieve the same lifetime fitness. Using concurrent data on seedfall (8 years) and sapling recruitment (12 years) from a long-established tree plot at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru, we show, that a 40-m canopy tree must produce roughly 13 times the mass of seeds to generate a sapling as a 5-m tall understory treelet. Mature tree height accounted for 41% of the variance in seed mass per sapling recruit in a simple univariate regression, whereas a multivariate model that included both intrinsic (seed mass, tree height, and dispersal mode) and extrinsic factors (sapling mortality as a surrogate for microsite quality) explained only 31% of the variance in number of seeds per sapling recruit. The multivariate model accounted for less variance because tall trees produce heavier seeds, on average, than treelets. We used qintactq (mostly dispersed) seeds to parameterize the response variable so as to reduce, if not eliminate, any contribution of conspecific crowding to the difference in reproductive efficiency between canopy trees and treelets. Accordingly, a test for negative density dependence failed to expose a relationship between density of reproductive trees in the population and reproductive efficiency (seed mass per recruit). We conclude that understory treelets, some of which produce only a dozen seeds a year, gain their per-seed advantage by failing to attract enemies a la Janzen-Connell, either in ecological or evolutionary time.

TI  - Newly rare or newly common: evolutionary feedbacks through changes in population density and relative species abundance, and their management implications.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Environmental management typically seeks to increase or maintain the population sizes of desirable species and to decrease population sizes of undesirable pests, pathogens, or invaders. With changes in population size come long-recognized changes in ecological processes that act in a density-dependent fashion. While the ecological effects of density dependence have been well studied, the evolutionary effects of changes in population size, via changes in ecological interactions with community members, are underappreciated. Here, we provide examples of changing selective pressures on, or evolution in, species as a result of changes in either density of conspecifics or changes in the frequency of heterospecific versus conspecific interactions. We also discuss the management implications of such evolutionary responses in species that have experienced rapid increases or decreases in density caused by human actions.

TI  - When do Localized Natural Enemies Increase Species Richness
PY  - 2005
AB  - The Janzen–Connell hypothesis states that local species-specific density dependence, mediated through specialist enemies of offspring such as fungal pathogens and insect seed predators, can facilitate coexistence of species by preventing recruitment near conspecific adults. We use spatially explicit simulation models and analytical approximations to evaluate how spatial scales of offspring and enemy dispersal affect species richness. In comparison with model communities in which both offspring and enemies disperse long distances, species richness is substantially decreased when offspring disperse long distances and enemies disperse short distances. In contrast, when both offspring and enemies disperse short distances species richness more than doubles and adults of each species are highly spatially clumped. For the range of conditions typical of tropical forests, locally dispersing specialist enemies may decrease species richness relative to enemies that disperse long distances. In communities where dispersal distances of both offspring and enemies are short, local effects may enhance species richness.

TI  - Spatial patterns reveal negative density dependence and habitat associations in tropical trees.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Understanding how plant species coexist in tropical rainforests is one of the biggest challenges in community ecology. One prominent hypothesis suggests that rare species are at an advantage because trees have lower survival in areas of high conspecific density due to increased attack by natural enemies, a process known as negative density dependence (NDD). A consensus is emerging that NDD is important for plant-species coexistence in tropical forests. Most evidence comes from short-term studies, but testing the prediction that NDD decreases the spatial aggregation of tree populations provides a long-term perspective. While spatial distributions have provided only weak evidence for NDD so far, the opposing effects of environmental heterogeneity might have confounded previous analyses. Here we use a novel statistical technique to control for environmental heterogeneity while testing whether spatial aggregation decreases with tree size in four tropical forests. We provide evidence for NDD in 22% of the 139 tree species analyzed and show that environmental heterogeneity can obscure the spatial signal of NDD. Environmental heterogeneity contributed to aggregation in 84% of species. We conclude that both biotic interactions and environmental heterogeneity play crucial roles in shaping tree dynamics in tropical forests.

TI  - Juvenile mortality and attacks by a specialist herbivore increase with conspecific adult basal area of Amazonian Swietenia macrophylla (Meliaceae)
PY  - 2006
AB  - According to the Janzen–Connell model, host-specific natural enemies can promote species coexistence of canopy trees in tropical forests by attacking progeny where they are most concentrated. However, empirical evidence relating negative density-dependent mortality to herbivory and, in particular, attack by specialist herbivores, remains rare. We investigated density dependence in a natural population of Swietenia macrophylla in a south-eastern Amazon forest of Brazil. Across 24 adult trees, we found that initial juvenile densities were positively correlated with basal area of adult conspecifics whereas subsequent survivorship over 1 y for these juveniles declined strongly with increasing basal area of adult conspecifics. For 18 trees with > 5 juveniles surviving for 1 y, further evidence supporting the Janzen–Connell mechanism was obtained in that leaf herbivory and attack by a specialist microlepidopteran moth (Steniscadia poliophaea) increased, and overall foliar condition decreased, with conspecific basal area. Moreover, when differences in mean juvenile size (number of extant leaves) were accounted for, juvenile survival over 1 y decreased with increased specialist leaf herbivory. Collectively, these results indicate that herbivores, in particular S. poliophaea, may contribute to density dependence among S. macrophylla juveniles. We conclude that the survival of juveniles and their probability of recruitment into the canopy is decreased where conspecific adults are largest and/or most numerous and find support for the importance of host-specific pests in driving density dependence among tropical trees.

TI  - Density dependence across multiple life stages in a temperate old-growth forest of northeast China
PY  - 2012
AB  - Recent studies on species coexistence suggest that density dependence is an important mechanism regulating plant populations. However, there have been few studies of density dependence conducted for more than one life-history stage or that control for habitat heterogeneity, which may influence spatial patterns of survival and mask density dependence. We explored the prevalence of density dependence across multiple life stages, and the effects of controlling for habitat heterogeneity, in a temperate forest in northeast China. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to test for density-dependent mortality of seedlings and spatial point pattern analysis to detect density dependence for sapling-to-juvenile transitions. Conspecific neighbors had a negative effect on survival of plants in both life stages. At the seedling stage, we found a negative effect of conspecific seedling neighbors on survival when analyzing all species combined. However, in species-level analyses, only 2 of 11 focal species were negatively impacted by conspecific neighbors, indicating wide variation among species in the strength of density dependence. Controlling for habitat heterogeneity did not alter our findings of density dependence at the seedling stage. For the sapling-to-juvenile transition stage, 11 of 15 focal species showed patterns of local scale (<10 m) conspecific thinning, consistent with negative density dependence. The results varied depending on whether we controlled for habitat heterogeneity, indicating that a failure to account for habitat heterogeneity can obscure patterns of density dependence. We conclude that density dependence may promote tree species coexistence by acting across multiple life-history stages in this temperate forest.

TI  - Insect seed predators and environmental change
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary


1
The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition.

2
We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity.

3
Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales.

4
Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host–parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species.

5
Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment.

6
Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator–plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.

TI  - Do natural enemies mediate conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence of trees? A meta-analysis of exclusion experiments
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Conspecific negative distance‐ and density‐dependence is believed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta‐analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides or exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance‐ and density‐dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that conspecific negative distance‐ and density‐dependence was more common at the seedling stage. Only 30% of studies showed significant conspecific negative distance‐ and density‐dependence. Among those studies, applying fungicides significantly reduced the effect of conspecific negative distance‐dependent mortality. Excluding large mammals reduced the effect of conspecifics, but with only marginal significance (p &lt; 0.1). Our study confirms that plant pathogens have a significant impact on distance‐dependent mortality and suggests that the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, appear to weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance‐dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types, and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance‐ and density‐dependence.</jats:p>

TI  - Sapling growth rates reveal conspecific negative density dependence in a temperate forest.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Local tree species diversity is maintained in part by conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). This pervasive mechanism occurs in a variety of forms and ecosystems, but research to date has been heavily skewed toward tree seedling survival in tropical forests. To evaluate CNDD more broadly, we investigated how sapling growth rates were affected by conspecific adult neighbors in a fully mapped 25.6 ha temperate deciduous forest. We examined growth rates as a function of the local adult tree neighborhood (via spatial autoregressive modeling) and compared the spatial positioning of faster-growing and slower-growing saplings with respect to adult conspecific and heterospecific trees (via bivariate point pattern analysis). In addition, to determine whether CNDD-driven variation in growth rates leaves a corresponding spatial signal, we extended our point pattern analysis to a static, growth-independent comparison of saplings and the next larger size class. We found that negative conspecific effects on sapling growth were most prevalent. Five of the nine species that were sufficiently abundant for analysis exhibited CNDD, while only one species showed evidence of a positive conspecific effect, and one or two species, depending on the analysis, displayed heterospecific effects. There was general agreement between the autoregressive models and the point pattern analyses based on sapling growth rates, but point pattern analyses based on single-point-in-time size classes yielded results that differed markedly from the other two approaches. Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that CNDD is an important force in temperate forests, and demonstrates that this process extends to sapling growth rates. Further, our findings indicate that point pattern analyses based solely on size classes may fail to detect the process of interest (e.g., neighborhood-driven variation in growth rates), in part due to the confounding of tree size and age.

TI  - Population dynamics of a seed feeding bug, Lygaeus equestris. 2. Temporal dynamics.
PY  - 1990
AB  - Population densities of the seed feeding bug, Lygaeus equestris have been followed for several years in three large study areas, each containing several host plant patches, in east central Sweden. Seed pod production of the perennial host plant Vincetoxicum hirundinaria as well as densities of another seed feeder, the tephritid fly Euphranta connexa, were also monitored. Densities of seed pods, E. connexa and L. equestris fluctuate about two orders of magnitude during a period of 11 yr. Population changes of L. equestris are density-independent during the non-breeding period of the year encompassing hibernation and preand posthibernation migrations. In most years mortality is low during this period, but occasionally high mortalities occur. During the breeding period, population changes are density-dependent and highly variable. Both sunshine conditions and abundance of seeds from the previous year affected population change during the breeding season. No competitive effect on L. equestris by E. connexa could be detected, despite the fact that E. connexa attacked over 90% of the pods in several years. Population density of L. equestris is determined by the sequence of weather effects of at least two years. The amount of sunshine, which affects the insect directly, also has indirect and delayed effects by affecting pod production of the host plant, and hence density of seeds on the ground in the following year. Furthermore, whereas population growth of L. equestris is positively affected by an increase in sunshine hours, pod production is negatively affected. This leads to considerable inertia in the temporal tracking of food resources by L. equestris.

TI  - The Post-Fire Assembly Processes of Tree Communities Based on Spatial Analysis of a Sierra Nevada Mixed-Conifer Forest
PY  - 2020
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms underlying tree spatial arrangements may provide significant insights into the processes in the maintenance of species coexistence. We examined the potential role of habitat heterogeneity, dispersal limitation, negative density dependence, fire history, and unilateral intraspecific and interspecific interactions of adults on juveniles in shaping the spatial patterns of four dominant tree species (Abies concolor, Pinus lambertiana, Calocedrus decurrens, and Quercus kelloggii) after fire in the Yosemite Forest Dynamic Plot, California, USA. We used the univariate pair correlation function and implemented three point pattern processes (homogeneous Poisson process, inhomogeneous Poisson process, and homogeneous Thomas process) to evaluate the potential contributions of habitat filtering and dispersal limitation. We used a bivariate null model to evaluate unilateral intraspecific and interspecific interactions of adults on juveniles. We also used the pairwise correlation function to investigate the spatial patterns of density dependence. To understand the effect of fire, we used the univariate pair correlation function to investigate pattern changes during the six years following fire. We compared spatial pattern changes in both sprouting species (Quercus kelloggii) and seeding species (Abies concolor), and also examined the changes in patterns of large-diameter individuals of Abies concolor, Pinus lambertiana, and Calocedrus decurrens in 2013 (pre-fire), 2016 (two years post-fire), and 2019. Comparing the contributions of the homogeneous Thomas process and the inhomogeneous Poisson process at different spatial scales showed the importance of dispersal limitation and habitat heterogeneity at finer scales (0 m to 5 m) and coarser scales (5 m to 60 m), respectively, which suggests that the joint effects of dispersal limitation and habitat heterogeneity contribute to the spatial patterns of these three dominant tree species. Furthermore, the results showed that the young individuals of Abies concolor and Pinus lambertiana were more commonly found around the conspecific adults. Juvenile regeneration to the 1 cm diameter threshold was highly aggregated following the fire. Large-diameter trees of Abies concolor, Pinus lambertiana, and Calocedrus decurrens generally did not exhibit patterns different from complete spatial randomness (Calocedrus decurrens), or displayed only slight aggregation (Abies concolor and Pinus lambertiana). In addition, Abies concolor and Pinus lambertiana showed positive and negative conspecific density dependence in the immediate post-fire period, respectively.

TI  - Predicting tropical insect herbivore abundance from host plant traits and phylogeny
PY  - 2012
AB  - Phylogenetic ecology has identified patterns of diversity in communities that may find explanation in trophic interactions, and yet there have been few attempts to directly relate such patterns among trophic levels. Density-dependent processes involving pests and pathogens, for example, have been invoked to account for plant community phylogenetic patterns, but relatively little is known about how plant relatedness might affect community structure at other trophic levels. We examined the degree to which the abundance of herbivores in a rain forest community is explained by the phylogeny and functional traits of host plants. We destructively sampled all stems ! 5 cm diameter in two 1-ha plots of New Guinea primary and secondary lowland forest to test predicted relationships between herbivore abundance and plant resources. We analyzed per-tree caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, total leaf biomass (kg), percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area (cm 2 /g), leaf nitrogen content (percentage of dry mass), and presence of exudates in the context of a plant community phylogeny estimated from DNA barcodes. Apart from nitrogen content and exudates, neither plant resources nor herbivore abundance showed evidence of phylogenetic signal in our community sample. The plant traits we measured could account for only 30% and 16% of variation in caterpillar and leaf miner abundance, respectively, among individual trees. Leaf biomass was a stronger predictor of herbivore abundance than either resource quality (leaf nitrogen content) or palatability (percentage of immature foliage, specific leaf area). The primary importance of resource quantity was also observed at the plant species level in analyses of species means and phylogenetic generalized least-squares regression. Plant relatedness did not account for much variation in herbivore abundance, but significant effects of exudates and leaf nitrogen content on caterpillar abundance illustrate how conserved traits at one trophic level may influence community-wide patterns at another.

TI  - Effects of latitude and conspecific plant density on insect leaf herbivory in oak saplings and seedlings.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Premise Abiotic factors and plant species traits have been shown to drive latitudinal gradients in herbivory, and yet, population-level factors have been largely overlooked within this context. One such factor is plant density, which may influence the strength of herbivory and may vary with latitude. Methods We measured insect herbivory and conspecific plant density (CPD) of oak (Quercus robur) seedlings and saplings along a 17° latitudinal gradient (2700 km) to test whether herbivory exhibited a latitudinal gradient, whether herbivory was associated with CPD, and whether such an association changed with latitude. Results We found a positive but saturating association between latitude and leaf herbivory. Furthermore, we found no significant relationship between CPD and herbivory, and such lack of density effects remained consistent throughout the sampled latitudinal gradient. Conclusions Despite the apparently negligible influence of plant density on herbivory for Q. robur, further research with other plant taxa and in different types of plant communities are needed to investigate density-dependent processes shaping geographical variation in plant-herbivore interactions.

TI  - Is the spatial pattern of a tree population in a seasonally dry tropical climate explained by density‐dependent mortality?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Spatial pattern of tropical plants is initially generated by limited seed dispersal, but the role of density-dependent and independent mechanisms as modifiers of these patterns across ontogeny is poorly understood. We investigated whether density-dependent mortality (DDM) and environmental heterogeneity can drive spatial pattern across the ontogeny of a tree in a seasonally dry tropical climate. We used Moran's I correlograms and spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE) to assess the spatial patterns of the pre- and post-germinative stages of Cordia oncocalyx (Boraginaceae), an abundant tree endemic in the deciduous thorny woodland in the northeastern Brazilian semiarid region. We also used RDA to analyse the effect of DDM and environmental heterogeneity (measured by microtopography and canopy openness) in the mortality and recruitment. Seeds, seedlings, juveniles and adults showed aggregated spatial patterns; infants and immatures were randomly distributed; adults, seeds and seedlings attracted each other while adult, juveniles and immatures repulsed each other. Infant and seedling mortality rates were related to DDM and the recruitment from infant to juvenile was more influenced by spatial heterogeneity. Attraction was determined by local dispersal; repulsion was related to DDM and environment heterogeneity, which allowed the return to aggregation in adult stage. Together, these results indicated that spatial pattern can change across ontogeny, in which the initial stages are responsive to DDM and the final stages are influenced by spatial heterogeneity.

TI  - Neighbourhood density and genetic relatedness interact to determine fruit set and abortion rates in a continuous tropical tree population
PY  - 2008
AB  - Tropical trees may show positive density dependence in fruit set and maturation due to pollen limitation in low-density populations. However, pollen from closely related individuals in the local neighbourhood might reduce fruit set or increase fruit abortion in self-incompatible tree species. We investigated the role of neighbourhood density and genetic relatedness on individual fruit set and abortion in the neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia in a large forest plot in central Panama. Using nested neighbourhood models, we found a strong positive effect of increased conspecific density on fruit set and maturation. However, high neighbourhood genetic relatedness interacted with density to reduce total fruit set and increase the proportion of aborted fruit. Our results imply a fitness advantage for individuals growing in high densities as measured by fruit set, but realized fruit set is lowered by increased neighbourhood relatedness. We hypothesize that the mechanism involved is increased visitation by density-dependent invertebrate pollinators in high-density populations, which increases pollen quantity and carry-over and increases fruit set and maturation, coupled with self-incompatibility at early and late stages due to biparental inbreeding that lowers fruit set and increases fruit abortion. Implications for the reproductive ecology and conservation of tropical tree communities in continuous and fragmented habitats are discussed.

TI  - Spatial patterns of primary seed dispersal and adult tree distributions: Genipa americana dispersed by Cebus capucinus
PY  - 2015
AB  - The spatial distribution of adult trees is typically not expected to reflect the spatial patterns of primary seed dispersal, due to many factors influencing post-dispersal modification of the seed shadow, such as seed predation, secondary seed dispersal and density-dependent survival. Here, we test the hypothesis that spatial distributions of primary seed shadows and adult trees are concordant by analysing the spatial distributions of adult Genipa americana trees and the seed shadow produced by its key primary disperser, the capuchin monkey (Cebus capucinus) in a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. We mapped the dispersal of G. americana seeds by the capuchins during focal animal follows (mean = 463 min, n = 50) of all adults in one free-ranging group over two early wet seasons (May–July, 2005 and 2006). We mapped the locations of all G. americana trees within a 60-ha plot that lay within the home range of the capuchin group. We conducted multiple spatial point pattern analyses comparing degrees of clustering of capuchin defecations and G. americana trees. We found that adult tree distributions and primary dispersal patterns are similarly aggregated at multiple spatial scales, despite the modification of the primary dispersal patterns and long dispersal distances.

TI  - Density dependence in forests is stronger in tropical and subtropical climates among closely related species
PY  - 2013
AB  - Density dependence has long been considered an important mechanism for species coexistence in forests. Density-dependent processes can be important mechanisms driving differences in species diversity across latitudes. Here we examined the decline in strength of density dependence with increasing latitude, and particularly how density dependence affected both conspecifics and heterospecifics.



Conspecific individuals within a species were predominantly aggregated at the three different latitudes of the three study sites in China. The percentage of aggregated species declined with increasing spatial scale and growth stages, which confirmed the overall importance of density dependence. Compared with a latitudinal gradient, the intensity of aggregation in the most northerly temperate (Changbaishan) plot was significantly higher than that in the tropical (Bawangling) or subtropical (Heishiding) plots. This showed that the strength of density dependence among conspecific individuals at low latitudes was stronger than that for high latitudes. We found that the more closely related species were more spatially adjacent in the temperate plot, while the opposite was true in the tropical and subtropical plots at most scales. After calculating the recruitment probability of all species of mature trees, we found that 19 of the 32 species in the tropical plot and 7 of the 12 species in the subtropical plot were less likely to recruit near closely related species. In the northern temperate plot, only one species demonstrated this phenomenon. These results therefore suggest that latitudinal variation in the intensity of negative density-dependent recruitment resulting from specialist natural enemies (the Janzen–Connell hypothesis) may contribute to the latitudinal gradient of diversity in trees.



The strength of density dependence at low latitudes was stronger than at high latitudes, regardless of whether this dependence was measured between only conspecific individuals or between individuals of closely related species.

TI  - Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Theory predicts that higher biodiversity in the tropics is maintained by specialized interactions among plants and their natural enemies that result in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). By using more than 3000 species and nearly 2.4 million trees across 24 forest plots worldwide, we show that global patterns in tree species diversity reflect not only stronger CNDD at tropical versus temperate latitudes but also a latitudinal shift in the relationship between CNDD and species abundance. CNDD was stronger for rare species at tropical versus temperate latitudes, potentially causing the persistence of greater numbers of rare species in the tropics. Our study reveals fundamental differences in the nature of local-scale biotic interactions that contribute to the maintenance of species diversity across temperate and tropical communities.

TI  - ANNUAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION IN SEEDFALL AND SEEDLING RECRUITMENT IN A NEOTROPICAL FOREST
PY  - 2005
AB  - 2 National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, Santa Barbara, California 93101-5504 USA Abstract. An economy of scale may lead to selection to increase interannual variation in seed production when the per seed probability of seedling establishment increases with seed production. Variable annual seedfall will, however, reduce this probability when post- dispersal seed fate is negatively density dependent on the local density of seeds, and seed dispersal and density dependence act identically across years. Intuitively, more variable annual seedfall causes the representative seed to experience a greater density of conspecific seeds and suffer greater density-dependent effects. This handicap must be overcome for the per seed probability of recruitment to be greater in years with greater seed production. We quantified spatial and annual variation in seedfall and seedling recruitment, evaluated density dependence and economies of scale during the seed-to-seedling transition, and investigated the synergistic consequences of density dependence and variable annual seed- fall for seedling recruitment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Weekly censuses of 200 0.5-m 2 seed traps documented seedfall for 15 years and 108 plant species. Annual censuses of 600 1-m 2 seedling plots documented recruitment for nine years and 32 species. The density of seedling recruits tended to increase with the density of seeds; however, the per seed probability of recruitment invariably decreased with seedfall density. Negative density dependence characterized the seed-to-seedling transition. Observed levels of spatial and interannual variation in seedfall density would reduce long-term recruitment by up to 28% if negatively density-dependent survival acted identically across years; however, the strength of negative density dependence varied significantly among years for 12 of 32 species. Negative density dependence occurred in all years for these species but was sig- nificantly weaker during the one or two years of greatest seedfall than during the remaining years of lower seedfall. The per seed probability of recruitment increased significantly with annual seedfall for eight of these species. These eight species realized postdispersal econ- omies of scale despite the reduction in long-term recruitment expected from the synergism between variable annual seed production and negatively density-dependent seed fate.

TI  - Density-Dependent Seed Predation of Quercus wutaishanica by Rodents in Response to Different Seed States.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The predation and/or dispersal of <i>Quercus</i> seeds by rodents play an important role in the creation of the tree species. The present study examined the effects of community habitats on the predation and dispersal of <i>Quercus wutaishanica</i> seeds by rodents. We released seeds with densities set at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 seed square meter with litter cover, soil burial, and bare ground in the Liupan Mountains National Nature Reserve in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwest China. The results showed that (1) the litter cover and soil burial significantly increased the seed survival probability compared with bare ground treatments, especially the predation in situ (PIS) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Both the scatter hoarding (SH) and larder hoarding (LH) for litter cover and soil burial were significantly increased compared with bare ground (<i>p</i> < 0.05). (2) The large seeds are preferentially predated after dispersal and their long-distance dispersal (>5 m) was significantly greater than that of small seeds (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while small seeds are more likely to be preyed on in situ or during short-distance dispersal (<3 m). (3) The <i>Q. wutaishanica</i> seed predation by rodents increased at a high density rather than at a low density, indicating a negative density-dependent predation. These findings provide insights into the ecological characteristics of <i>Quercus</i> tree regeneration and shed light on the coexistence between rodents and different-sized seeds.

TI  - Non-Density Dependent Pollen Dispersal of Shorea maxwelliana (Dipterocarpaceae) Revealed by a Bayesian Mating Model Based on Paternity Analysis in Two Synchronized Flowering Seasons
PY  - 2013
AB  - Pollinator syndrome is one of the most important determinants regulating pollen dispersal in tropical tree species. It has been widely accepted that the reproduction of tropical forest species, especially dipterocarps that rely on insects with weak flight for their pollination, is positively density-dependent. However differences in pollinator syndrome should affect pollen dispersal patterns and, consequently, influence genetic diversity via the mating process. We examined the pollen dispersal pattern and mating system of Shorea maxwelliana, the flowers of which are larger than those of Shorea species belonging to section Mutica which are thought to be pollinated by thrips (weak flyers). A Bayesian mating model based on the paternity of seeds collected from mother trees during sporadic and mass flowering events revealed that the estimated pollen dispersal kernel and average pollen dispersal distance were similar for both flowering events. This evidence suggests that the putative pollinators – small beetles and weevils – effectively contribute to pollen dispersal and help to maintain a high outcrossing rate even during sporadic flowering events. However, the reduction in pollen donors during a sporadic event results in a reduction in effective pollen donors, which should lead to lower genetic diversity in the next generation derived from seeds produced during such an event. Although sporadic flowering has been considered less effective for outcrossing in Shorea species that depend on thrips for their pollination, effective pollen dispersal by the small beetles and weevils ensures outcrossing during periods of low flowering tree density, as occurs in a sporadic flowering event.

TI  - Rare genotype advantage promotes survival and genetic diversity of a tropical palm.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Negative density dependence, where survival decreases as density increases, is a well-established driver of species diversity at the community level, but the degree to which a similar process might act on the density or frequency of genotypes within a single plant species to maintain genetic diversity has not been well studied in natural systems. In this study, we determined the maternal genotype of naturally dispersed seeds of the palm Oenocarpus bataua within a tropical forest in northwest Ecuador, tracked the recruitment of each seed, and assessed the role of individual-level genotypic rarity on survival. We demonstrate that negative frequency-dependent selection within this species conferred a survival advantage to rare maternal genotypes and promoted population-level genetic diversity. The strength of the observed rare genotype survival advantage was comparable to the effect of conspecific density regardless of genotype. These findings corroborate an earlier, experimental study and implicate negative frequency-dependent selection of genotypes as an important, but currently underappreciated, determinant of plant recruitment and within-species genetic diversity. Incorporating intraspecific genetic variation into studies and theory of forest dynamics may improve our ability to understand and manage forests, and the processes that maintain their diversity.

TI  - Elevational variation in density dependence in a subtropical forest
PY  - 2014
AB  - Density-dependent mortality has been recognized as an important mechanism that underpins tree species diversity, especially in tropical forests. However, few studies have attempted to explore how density dependence varies with spatial scale and even fewer have attempted to identify why there is scale-dependent differentiation. In this study, we explore the elevational variation in density dependence. Three 1-ha permanent plots were established at low and high elevations in the Heishiding subtropical forest, southern China. Using data from 1200 1 m2 seedling quadrats, comprising of 200 1 m2 quadrats located in each 1-ha plot, we examined the variation in density dependence between elevations using a generalized linear mixed model with crossed random effects. A greenhouse experiment also investigated the potential effects of the soil biota on density-dependent differentiation. Our results demonstrated that density-dependent seedling mortality can vary between elevations in subtropical forests. Species found at a lower elevation suffered stronger negative density dependence than those found at a higher elevation. The greenhouse experiment indicated that two species that commonly occur at both elevations suffered more from soilborne pathogens during seed germination and seedling growth when they grew at the lower elevation, which implied that soil pathogens may play a crucial role in density-dependent spatial variation.

TI  - Limited contributions of plant pathogens to density-dependent seedling mortality of mast fruiting Bornean trees.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Fungal pathogens are implicated in driving tropical plant diversity by facilitating strong, negative density-dependent mortality of conspecific seedlings (C-NDD). Assessment of the role of fungal pathogens in mediating coexistence derives from relatively few tree species and predominantly the Neotropics, limiting our understanding of their role in maintaining hyper-diversity in many tropical forests. A key question is whether fungal pathogen-mediated C-NDD seedling mortality is ubiquitous across diverse plant communities. Using a manipulative shadehouse experiment, we tested the role of fungal pathogens in mediating C-NDD seedling mortality of eight mast fruiting Bornean trees, typical of the species-rich forests of South East Asia. We demonstrate species-specific responses of seedlings to fungicide and density treatments, generating weak negative density-dependent mortality. Overall seedling mortality was low and likely insufficient to promote overall community diversity. Although conducted in the same way as previous studies, we find little evidence that fungal pathogens play a substantial role in determining patterns of seedling mortality in a SE Asian mast fruiting forest, questioning our understanding of how Janzen-Connell mechanisms structure the plant communities of this globally important forest type.

TI  - Conspecific negative density dependence and forest diversity.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Conspecific negative density-dependent establishment, in which local abundance negatively affects establishment of conspecific seedlings through host-specific enemies, can influence species diversity of plant communities, but the generality of this process is not well understood. We tested the strength of density dependence using the United States Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database containing 151 species from more than 200,000 forest plots spanning 4,000,000 square kilometers. We found that most species experienced conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), but there was little effect of heterospecific density. Additionally, abundant species exhibited weaker CNDD than rarer species, and species-rich regions exhibited stronger CNDD than species-poor regions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that CNDD is a pervasive mechanism driving diversity across a gradient from boreal to subtropical forests.

TI  - Life history traits influence the strength of distance- and density-dependence at different life stages of two Amazonian palms
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background and aims Natural enemies are known to be important in regulating plant populations and contributing to species coexistence (Janzen-Connell effects). The strength of Janzen-Connell effects (both distance- and density-effects) varies across species, but the life history traits that may mediate such a variation are not well understood. This study examined Janzen-Connell effects across the life stages (seed through adult stages) of two sympatric palm species with distinct phenologies and shade tolerances, two traits that may mediate the strength and timing of Janzen-Connell effects. Methods Populations of two common palm species, Attalea phalerata and Astrocaryum murumuru , were studied in Manu National Park, Peru. Seed predation experiments were conducted to assess Janzen-Connell effects at the seed stage. In the post-seed stages, spatial point pattern analyses of the distributions of individuals and biomass were used to infer the strength of distance- and density-effects. Key results Seed predation was both negative distance- and density-dependent consistent with the Janzen-Connell effects. However, only seedling recruitment for asynchronously fruiting Attalea phalerata was depressed near adults while recruitment remained high for synchronously fruiting Astrocaryum murumuru , consistent with weak distance-effects. Negative density-effects were strong in the early stages for shade-intolerant Attalea phalerata but weak or absent in shade-tolerant Astrocaryum murumuru. Conclusions Distance- and density-effects varied among the life stages of the two palm species in a manner that corresponded to their contrasting phenology and shade tolerance. Generalizing such connections across many species would provide a route to understanding how trait-mediated Janzen-Connell effects scale up to whole communities of species.

TI  - Prevalence and strength of density‐dependent tree recruitment
PY  - 2015
AB  - Density dependence could maintain diversity in forests, but studies continue to disagree on its role. Part of the disagreement results from the fact that different studies have evaluated different responses (survival, recruitment, or growth) of different stages (seeds, seedlings, or adults) to different inputs (density of seedlings, density or distance to adults). Most studies are conducted on a single site and thus are difficult to generalize. Using USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we analyzed over a million seedling-to-sapling recruitment observations of 50 species from the eastern United States, controlling for the effects of climate. We focused on the per-seedling recruitment rate, because it is most likely to promote diversity and to be identified in observational or experimental data. To understand the prevalence of density dependence, we quantified the number of species with significant positive or negative effects. To understand the strength of density dependence, we determined the magnitude of effects among con- and heterospecifics, and how it changes with overall species abundance. We found that density dependence is pervasive among the 50 species, as the majority of them have significant effects and mostly negative. Density-dependence effects are stronger from conspecific than heterospecfic adult neighbors, consistent with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Contrary to recent reports, density-dependence effects are more negative for common than rare species, suggesting disproportionately stronger population regulation in common species. We conclude that density dependence is pervasive, and it is strongest from conspecific neighbors of common species. Our analysis provides direct evidence that density dependence reaulates opulation dynamics of tree species in eastern U.S. forests.

TI  - Rich and Specialized Plant-Insect Associations in a Middle–Late Paleocene (58–60 Ma) Neotropical Rainforest (Bogotá Formation, Colombia)
PY  - 2021
AB  - Plant predation by insects is a major driver of high plant diversity in modern tropical forests. Previous reports of leaf damage in middle–late Paleocene Neotropical rainforests of Cerrejon, Colombia, show that leaf herbivory was abundant but of low diversity, mainly inflicted by generalized feeders. Here, we present and describe plant-insect associations in leaf fossils from the middle–late Paleocene Bogota Formation, central Colombia, to test whether the high abundance and low richness of insect damage typified early evolving Neotropical rainforests. The Bogota flora records the highest richness and frequency of insect-damage associations among comparable Paleocene floras in North America, Patagonia, and Europe, as well as the highest number of leaf mines and galling associations. These results indicate that by the middle–late Paleocene, plant-insect herbivore interactions were much more intense and host-specialized in Neotropical rainforests of the Bogota region than elsewhere. The rich and frequent galling associations, a distinctive feature of the Bogota flora, are consistent with the preferential use of canopy leaves by galling insects seen in modern Neotropical rainforests. Our results also indicate differences in plant-insect associations among Paleocene Neotropical rainforests, perhaps reflecting a geographically heterogeneous ecological recovery from the end-Cretaceous ecological crisis. Plant insect-associations in the Bogota flora also suggest a deep historical context for negative density-dependence as a potential driver (and maintainer) of the high plant diversity observed in modern Neotropical rainforests.

TI  - Interactions with soil fungi alter density dependence and neighborhood effects in a locally abundant dipterocarp species.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Seedling recruitment can be strongly affected by the composition of nearby plant species. At the neighborhood scale (on the order of tens of meters), adult conspecifics can modify soil chemistry and the presence of host microbes (pathogens and mutualists) across their combined canopy area or rooting zones. At local or small spatial scales (on the order of one to few meters), conspecific seed or seedling density can influence the strength of intraspecific light and resource competition and also modify the density-dependent spread of natural enemies such as pathogens or invertebrate predators. Intrinsic correlation between proximity to adult conspecifics (i.e., recruitment neighborhood) and local seedling density, arising from dispersal, makes it difficult to separate the independent and interactive factors that contribute to recruitment success. Here, we present a field experiment in which we manipulated both the recruitment neighborhood and seedling density to explore how they interact to influence the growth and survival of <i>Dryobalanops aromatica</i>, a dominant ectomycorrhizal tree species in a Bornean tropical rainforest. First, we found that both local seedling density and recruitment neighborhood had effects on performance of <i>D</i>. <i>aromatica</i> seedlings, though the nature of these impacts varied between growth and survival. Second, we did not find strong evidence that the effect of density on seedling survival is dependent on the presence of conspecific adult trees. However, accumulation of mutualistic fungi beneath conspecifics adults does facilitate establishment of <i>D</i>. <i>aromatica</i> seedlings. In total, our results suggest that recruitment near adult conspecifics was not associated with a performance cost and may have weakly benefitted recruiting seedlings. Positive effects of conspecifics may be a factor facilitating the regional hyperabundance of this species. Synthesis: Our results provide support for the idea that dominant species in diverse forests may escape the localized recruitment suppression that limits abundance in rarer species.

TI  - Intraspecific density dependence and a guild of consumers coexisting on one resource.
PY  - 2012
AB  - The importance of negative intraspecific density dependence to promoting species coexistence in a community is well accepted. However, such mechanisms are typically omitted from more explicit models of community dynamics. Here I analyze a variation of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur consumer–resource model that includes negative intraspecific density dependence for consumers to explore its effect on the coexistence of multiple consumers feeding on a single resource. This analysis demonstrates that a guild of multiple consumers can easily coexist on a single resource if each limits its own abundance to some degree, and stronger intraspecific density dependence permits a wider variety of consumers to coexist. The mechanism permitting multiple consumers to coexist works in a fashion similar to apparent competition or to each consumer having its own specialized predator. These results argue for a more explicit emphasis on how negative intraspecific density dependence is generated and how these mechanisms combine wit...

TI  - Community compensatory trend prevails from tropical to temperate forest.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Community compensatory trend (CCT) is thought to facilitate persistence of rare species and thus stabilize species composition in tropical forests. However, whether CCT acts over broad geographical ranges is still in question. In this study, we tested for the presence of negative density dependence (NDD) and CCT in three forests along a tropical-temperate gradient. Inventory data were collected from forest communities located in three different latitudinal zones in China. Two widely used methods were used to test for NDD at the community level. The first method considered relationships between the relative abundance ratio and adult abundance. The second method emphasized the effect of adult abundance on abundance of established younger trees. Evidence for NDD acting on different growth forms was tested by using the first method, and the presence of CCT was tested by checking whether adult abundance of rare species affected that of established younger trees less than did abundance of common species. Both analyses indicated that NDD existed in seedling, sapling and pole stages in all three plant communities and that this effect increased with latitude. However, the extent of NDD varied among understory, midstory and canopy trees in the three communities along the gradient. Additionally, despite evidence of NDD for almost all common species, only a portion of rare species showed NDD, supporting the action of CCT in all three communities. So, we conclude that NDD and CCT prevail in the three recruitment stages of the tree communities studied; rare species achieve relative advantage through CCT and thus persist in these communities; CCT clearly facilitates newly established species and maintains tree diversity within communities across our latitudinal gradient.

TI  - Coexistence is stabilized by conspecific negative density dependence via fungal pathogens more than oomycete pathogens.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Plant pathogens are often hypothesized to promote species coexistence by generating conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). However, the relative importance of fungal versus oomycete pathogens in maintaining plant species coexistence and community composition remains unresolved, despite their recognized effects on plant performance. Here, we use fungicide application to investigate how fungal versus oomycete pathogens affect plant species coexistence in an alpine meadow. We found that the severity of foliar fungal disease was density-dependent at both intra- and interspecific levels. Fungal pathogen-exclusion treatment successfully decreased the severity of foliar fungal diseases, with no detectable effects on root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or on soil chemical properties. Fungal pathogens were important factors shaping CNDD across 25 coexisting plant species. Exclusion of fungal pathogens significantly reduced plant species richness and Shannon's evenness. Treatments that excluded fungal pathogens also led to significant shifts in plant community composition toward more Poaceae and Cyperaceae. These results indicate that fungal pathogens, especially those affecting aboveground plant parts, may play a larger role in maintaining species coexistence and shaping community composition than has been previously recognized.

TI  - Is there safety-in-numbers for prey?
PY  - 2000
AB  - The abundance of prey affects the rate of predation, but little consensus exists on whether this enhances or reduces per capita mortality. Studies of aggregating prey in marine habitats generally emphasise that the probability of predation of any individual is the reciprocal of the number of prey within a school. A field experiment tested the alternative hypotheses that predation by predatory fish on schooling prey (1) increased with an increase in the number of prey per school and that this caused (2) survival to be lower in schools with more individuals. The number of prey (juvenile Acanthochromis polyacanthus) per school was manipulated in replicate treatments with natural densities of large predatory fish (open plots) and treatments without large predatory fish (exclusion cages). Large predatory fish preyed on juveniles in a density-dependent manner and this was the key source of density-dependent mortality in plots open to all predators. There was some suggestion that small predatory fish also prey on juveniles in a density-dependent manner, but this was weak and did not translate into density-dependent mortality of juveniles. It would appear that aggregation of prey may be a successful strategy against predation from some predators, but not always every predator, or all predators in combination.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Where conspecific seedlings occur at high densities, density‐dependent processes tend to depress their performance and survival relative to co‐occurring heterospecifics. We extend this observation to within‐species genetic diversity and relatedness. We posit that seedling growth and survival increase where there is higher genetic diversity, and lower relatedness, among seedling populations, under the expectation that increased genetic dissimilarity among conspecific seedlings affords greater resistance to pathogens.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We used estimates of individual seedling genetic diversity (multilocus heterozygosity (sMLH)) and genetic relatedness among conspecific seedlings (pairwise kinship coefficients (LRI)), under high and low conspecific seedling density, coupled with censuses of seedling growth and mortality over 30 months to explore the role of genetic diversity and relatedness on growth and mortality of 1,485 seedlings of four dipterocarp species in an undisturbed Bornean tropical rainforest. We hypothesized that more genetically diverse and less related co‐occurring seedlings would display higher survival and growth rates.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>In three of our four species, lower genetic diversity increased the probability of mortality over 30 months. We observed no effect of genetic diversity on relative growth rates. Contrary to our expectations, only one species showed a negative effect of increased relatedness on mortality. In two of the four species studied, seedlings that were more genetically related to neighbouring conspecific seedlings in the sample plot were less likely to die, but grew more slowly.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our results confirm that genetic diversity and relatedness among seedlings shape survival probabilities differentially across species. In contrast, we found no differences in mortality and growth rates between plots with low and high seedling density. Our results suggest that a greater abundance of pollen donors could contribute to cohort seedling survival in some species, though not all, and the specific mechanisms by which genetic relatedness determines seedling demography remain uncertain. These results have conservation and management implications in view of changing patterns of gene flow in fragmented, exploited and degraded tropical rainforests, which might differentially influence natural regeneration among species.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

AB  - Acommunityoffrugivorousweevilswasstudiedbyquantitativerearingof57weevilspeciesrepresentedby 10485individualsfrom326woodyplantspeciesinlowlandrainforestinPapuaNewGuinea.Onlyfruitsfrom35%of plant species were attacked by weevils. On average, weevils were reared from only 1 in 33 fruits and 1 kg of fruit was attacked by 2.51 individuals. Weevil host specificity was relatively high: 42% of weevil species fed on a single plant genus, 19% on a single plant family and only 16% were reared from more than one family. However, monophagous specialists represented only 23% of all reared individuals. The average 1 kg of fruits was infested by 1.84 individuals of generalist weevils (feeding on allogeneric or allofamilial host species), 0.52 individual of specialists (feeding on a single or several congeneric species), and 0.15 individual of unknown host specificity. Large-seeded fruits with thin mesocarp tended to host specialist species whereas those with thick, fleshy mesocarp were often infested with both specialists and generalists. Weevils tended to avoid small-seeded, fleshy fruits. The low incidence of seed damage (3% of seeds) suggests that weevils are unlikely to play a major role in regulating plant populations via density-dependent mortality processes outlined by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

TI  - Tri‐trophic interactions affect density dependence of seed fate in a tropical forest palm
PY  - 2011
AB  - Natural enemies, especially host-specific enemies, are hypothesised to facilitate the coexistence of plant species by disproportionately inflicting more damage at increasing host abundance. However, few studies have assessed such Janzen‐Connell mechanisms on a scale relevant for coexistence and no study has evaluated potential topdown influences on the specialized pests. We quantified seed predation by specialist invertebrates and generalist vertebrates, as well as larval predation on these invertebrates, for the Neotropical palm Attalea butyracea across ten 4-ha plots spanning 20-fold variation in palm density. As palm density increased, seed attack by bruchid beetles increased, whereas seed predation by rodents held constant. But because rodent predation on bruchid larvae increased disproportionately with increasing palm density, bruchid emergence rates and total seed predation by rodents and bruchids combined were both density-independent. Our results demonstrate that topdown effects can limit the potential of host-specific insects to induce negative-density dependence in plant populations.

TI  - Plant density can increase invertebrate postdispersal seed predation in an experimental grassland community
PY  - 2016
AB  - Janzen-Connell effects are negative effects on the survival of a plant's progeny at high conspecific densities or close to its conspecifics. Although the role of Janzen-Connell effects on the maintenance of plant diversity was frequently studied, only few studies targeted Janzen-Connell effects via postdispersal seed predation in temperate grassland systems. We examined effects of conspecific density (abundance of conspecific adult plants) on postdispersal seed predation by invertebrates of three grassland species (Centaurea jacea, Geranium pratense, and Knautia arvensis) in experimental plant communities. Additionally, we examined the impact of plant species richness and different seed predator communities on total and relative seed predation (= seed predation of one plant species relative to others). We offered seeds in an exclusion experiment, where treatments allowed access for (1) arthropods and slugs, (2) arthropods only, (3) small arthropods only, and (4) slugs only. Treatments were placed in plots covering a gradient of abundance of conspecific adults at different levels of plant species richness (1, 2, 3, 4, 8 species). Two of the plant species (C. jacea and K. arvensis) experienced higher rates of seed predation and relative predation with increasing abundance of conspecific adults. For C. jacea, this effect was mitigated with increasing plant species richness. Differences in seed predator communities shifted seed predation between the plant species and changed the magnitude of seed predation of one plant species relative to the others. We exemplify density-dependent increase in seed predation via invertebrates in grassland communities shaping both the total magnitude of species-specific seed predation and seed predation of one species relative to others. Further differences in seed predator groups shift the magnitude of seed predation between different plant species. This highlights the importance of invertebrate seed predation to structure grasslands via density-dependent effects and differing preferences of consumer groups.

TI  - Conspecific density dependence and community structure: Insights from 11 years of monitoring in an old-growth temperate forest in Northeast China.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Forest community structure may be influenced by seedling density dependence, however, the effect is loosely coupled with population dynamics and diversity in the short term. In the long term the strength of conspecific density dependence may fluctuate over time because of seedling abundance, yet few long-term studies exist. Based on 11 years of seedling census data and tree census data from a 25-ha temperate forest plot in Northeast China, we used generalized linear mixed models to test the relative effects of local neighborhood density and abiotic factors on seedling density and seedling survival. Spatial point pattern analysis was used to determine if spatial patterns of saplings and juveniles, in relation to conspecific adults, were in accordance with patterns uncovered by conspecific negative density dependence at the seedling stage. Our long-term results showed that seedling density was mainly positively affected by conspecific density, suggesting dispersal limitation of seedling development. The probability of seedling survival significantly decreased over 1 year with increasing conspecific density, indicating conspecific negative density dependence in seedling establishment. Although there was variation in conspecific negative density dependence at the seedling stage among species and across years, a dispersed pattern of conspecific saplings relative to conspecific adults at the local scale (<10 m) was observed in four of the 11 species examined. Overall, sapling spatial patterns were consistent with the impacts of conspecific density on seedling dynamics, which suggests that conspecific negative density dependence is persistent over the long term. From the long-term perspective, conspecific density dependence is an important driver of species coexistence in temperate forests.

PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Janzen‐Connell (JC) hypothesis predicts that conspecific negative density dependence contributes to the maintenance of plant diversity by lowering the recruitment of locally abundant plant species. The JC hypothesis is a widely evoked explanation for the high species diversity in tropical forests, but remains poorly tested in other species‐rich systems such as Mediterranean woodlands. As such, we tested if the JC operates and the role of soil‐borne oomycetes in a species‐rich Mediterranean woodland of Western Australia, where post‐fire recruitment can lead to high seedling densities, using the common <jats:italic>Banksia attenuata</jats:italic> as a case study. We attempted to decipher the effects of oomycete pathogens and distance from conspecific trees on intraspecific seedling survival and growth. Contrary to the JC hypothesis, we found little evidence of negative density dependence, but our results suggest positive density dependence survival under conspecific trees. Oomycete‐driven mortality in seedlings was also found regardless of the type of tree. Our results suggest that short‐term seedling recruitment patterns in this species‐rich, fire‐prone ecosystem do not follow the JC hypothesis. Future studies should explore whether negative conspecific density and distance dependence could play a greater role in later stages of the post‐fire recovery process.</jats:p>

TI  - Forest dynamics of a subtropical monsoon forest in Dinghushan, China: recruitment, mortality and the pace of community change
PY  - 2013
AB  - Structure and demographics in many tropical forests is changing, but the causes of these changes remain unclear. We studied 5 y (2005-2010) of species turnover, recruitment, mortality and population change data from a 20-hasubtropicalforestplotinDinghushan,China,toidentifytrendsinforestchange,andtotestwhethertreemortality is associated with intraspecific or interspecific competition. We found the Dinghushan forest to be more dynamic than one temperate and two tropical forests in a comparison of large, long-term forest dynamics plots. Within Dinghushan, size-classdistributionswerebell-shapedonlyforthethreemostdominantspeciesandreverseJ-shapedforotherspecies. Bell-shaped population distributions can indicate a population in decline, but our data suggest that these large and long-lived species are not in decline because the pattern is driven by increasing probabilities of transition to larger size class with increasing size and fast growth in saplings. Spatially aggregated tree species distributions were common for surviving and dead individuals. Competitive associations were more frequently intraspecific than interspecific. The competition that induced tree mortality was more associated with intraspecific than interspecific interactions. Intraspecific competitive exclusion and density-dependence appear to play important roles in tree mortality in this subtropical forest.

TI  - Adult trees cause density-dependent mortality in conspecific seedlings by regulating the frequency of pathogenic soil fungi.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Negative density-dependent seedling mortality has been widely detected in tropical, subtropical and temperate forests, with soil pathogens as a major driver. Here we investigated how host density affects the composition of soil pathogen communities and consequently influences the strength of plant-soil feedbacks. In field censuses of six 1-ha permanent plots, we found that survival was much lower for newly germinated seedlings that were surrounded by more conspecific adults. The relative abundance of pathogenic fungi in soil increased with increasing conspecific tree density for five of nine tree species; more soil pathogens accumulated around roots where adult tree density was higher, and this greater pathogen frequency was associated with lower seedling survival. Our findings show how tree density influences populations of soil pathogens, which creates plant-soil feedbacks that contribute to community-level and population-level compensatory trends in seedling survival.

TI  - Dispersal modes and spatial patterns of tree species in a tropical forest in Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India.
PY  - 2008
AB  - We characterized the dispersal modes and spatial patterns of 128 tree species in a tropical semievergreen forest of Arunachal Pradesh, northeastern India. A high percentage of species are animaldispersed (78%), while about 22% (28) are dispersed abiotically (wind or gravity-dispersed). Of the animal-dispersed species, 54 species were primarily bird-dispersed, 25 were mammal-dispersed, and 21 were dispersed by both groups. We hypothesized that adult tree distribution patterns were related to dispersal mode and fruit size. We predicted that tree species with mechanisms for longdistance seed dispersal are likely to show more uniform or random spatial patterns than those with limited seed dispersal. Tree species with large fruits were also predicted to have greater levels of clumping than those that have small fruits. However, all tree species had a clumped distribution pattern. At the community level, we found no differences in spatial patterns based on dispersal mode for a subset of 50 tree species. Fruit size was, however, positively correlated with higher levels of spatial aggregation suggesting that tree species distributions are to an extent limited by dispersal. The importance of dispersal mode in determining adult tree distribution patterns at the community level may be obscured by interacting effects of other factors such as patchy habitat conditions and density-dependent mortality factors at different life-history stages that ultimately determine adult tree distributions.

TI  - Disturbance and clonal reproduction determine liana distribution and maintain liana diversity in a tropical forest.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Negative density dependence (NDD) and habitat specialization have received strong empirical support as mechanisms that explain tree species diversity maintenance and distribution in tropical forests. In contrast, disturbance appears to play only a minor role. Previous studies have rarely examined the relative strengths of these diversity maintenance mechanisms concurrently, and few studies have included plant groups other than trees. Here we used a large, spatially explicit data set from Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI) to test whether liana and tree species distribution patterns are most consistent with NDD, habitat specialization, or disturbance. We found compelling evidence that trees responded to habitat specialization and NDD; however, only disturbance explained the distribution of the majority of liana species and maintained liana diversity. Lianas appear to respond to disturbance with high vegetative (clonal) reproduction, and liana species' ability to produce clonal stems following disturbance results in a clumped spatial distribution. Thus, clonal reproduction following disturbance explains local liana spatial distribution and diversity maintenance on BCI, whereas negative density dependence and habitat specialization, two prominent mechanisms contributing to tree species diversity and distribution, do not.

Host ranges of natural enemies generally encompass several closely related plant taxa suggesting that seedlings should also do poorly around adults of closely related species. We investigated the effects of adult Parashorea malaanonan on seedling survival in a Bornean rain forest. Survival of P. malaanonan seedlings was highest at intermediate distances from parent trees while heterospecific seedlings were unaffected by distance. Leaf herbivores did not drive this relationship. Survival of seedlings was lowest for P. malaanonan, and increased with phylogenetic dissimilarity from this species, suggesting that survival of close relatives of common species is reduced. This study suggests that distance dependence contributes to species coexistence and highlights the need for further investigation into the role of shared plant enemies in community dynamics.

TI  - Multiple stages of tree seedling recruitment are altered in tropical forests degraded by selective logging.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Tropical forest degradation is a global environmental issue. In degraded forests, seedling recruitment of canopy trees is vital for forest regeneration and recovery. We investigated how selective logging, a pervasive driver of tropical forest degradation, impacts canopy tree seedling recruitment, focusing on an endemic dipterocarp Dryobalanops lanceolata in Sabah, Borneo. During a mast-fruiting event in intensively logged and nearby unlogged forest, we examined four stages of the seedling recruitment process: seed production, seed predation, and negative density-dependent germination and seedling survival. Our results suggest that each stage of the seedling recruitment process is altered in logged forest. The seed crop of D. lanceolata trees in logged forest was one-third smaller than that produced by trees in unlogged forest. The functional role of vertebrates in seed predation increased in logged forest while that of non-vertebrates declined. Seeds in logged forest were less likely to germinate than those in unlogged forest. Germination increased with local-scale conspecific seed density in unlogged forest, but seedling survival tended to decline. However, both germination and seedling survival increased with local-scale conspecific seed density in logged forest. Notably, seed crop size, germination, and seedling survival tended to increase for larger trees in both unlogged and logged forests, suggesting that sustainable timber extraction and silvicultural practices designed to minimize damage to the residual stand are important to prevent seedling recruitment failure. Overall, these impacts sustained by several aspects of seedling recruitment in a mast-fruiting year suggest that intensive selective logging may affect long-term population dynamics of D. lanceolata. It is necessary to establish if other dipterocarp species, many of which are threatened by the timber trade, are similarly affected in tropical forests degraded by intensive selective logging.

TI  - Plants as Reef Fish: Fitting the Functional Form of Seedling Recruitment
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract: The life histories of many species depend first on dispersal to local sites and then on establishment. After dispersal, density‐independent and density‐dependent mortalities modify propagule supply, determining the number of individuals that establish. Because multiple factors influence recruitment, the dichotomy of propagule versus establishment limitation is best viewed as a continuum along which the strength of propagule or establishment limitation changes with propagule input. To evaluate the relative importance of seed and establishment limitation for plants, we (1) describe the shape of the recruitment function and (2) use limitation and elasticity analyses to quantify the sensitivity of recruitment to perturbations in seed limitation and density‐independent and density‐dependent mortality. Using 36 seed augmentation studies for 18 species, we tested four recruitment functions against one another. Although the linear model (accounting for seed limitation and density‐independent mortality) ...

TI  - Conspecific Leaf Litter-Mediated Effect of Conspecific Adult Neighborhood on Early-Stage Seedling Survival in A Subtropical Forest
PY  - 2016
AB  - Conspecific adults have strong negative effect on the survival of nearby early-stage seedlings and thus can promote species coexistence by providing space for the regeneration of heterospecifics. The leaf litter fall from the conspecific adults, and it could mediate this conspecific negative adult effect. However, field evidence for such effect of conspecific leaf litter remains absent. In this study, we used generalized linear mixed models to assess the effects of conspecific leaf litter on the early-stage seedling survival of four dominant species (Machilus leptophylla, Litsea elongate, Acer pubinerve and Distylium myricoides) in early-stage seedlings in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in eastern China. Our results consistently showed that the conspecific leaf litter of three species negatively affected the seedling survival. Meanwhile, the traditional conspecific adult neighborhood indices failed to detect this negative conspecific adult effect. Our study revealed that the accumulation of conspecific leaf litter around adults can largely reduce the survival rate of nearby seedlings. Ignoring it could result in underestimation of the importance of negative density dependence and negative species interactions in the natural forest communities.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of Floerkea proserpinacoides (Limnanthaceae), an annual plant of the deciduous forest of eastern North America.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Abstract Because environmental filters are temporally and spatially heterogeneous, there often is a lack of significant relationship between the spatial patterns of successive life stages in plant populations. In this study, we determined the spatiotemporal relationships between different life stages in two populations of an annual plant of the deciduous forests of eastern North America, Floerkea proserpinacoides. Demographic surveys were done over a 4-yr period, and experiments were performed in the field and under controlled conditions to test for the effects of various environmental factors on population dynamics. There was a general lack of relationship between the spatial patterns of seed bank and seedling density, and a lack of similarity between their spatial correlograms. This was related mostly to the effects of spatially variable environmental filters operating on germination and emergence. However, environmental filters acting on plant survival were stable through time and contributed to stabilize the density and spatial patterns of the populations. Despite density-dependent presenescence mortality, spatial patterns of seedlings and mature individuals were similar and their correlograms were alike, suggesting that mortality did not fully compensate for density. Estimated fecundity was negatively correlated with population density over the study period. Although flower production started only 2-3 wk after emergence, seed maturation mostly occurred at the end of the life cycle, just before the onset of plant senescence. Yet, individual fecundity was low for an annual plant, i.e., 3.0 ± 0.5 mature seeds/plant (mean ± 1 SE). Seed predation by vertebrates was not significant. Low soil moisture had little effect on the total number of seeds germinating, although it slowed down the germination process. In quadrats where leaf litter was experimentally doubled, seedling emergence was lower than in control quadrats; in quadrats where leaf litter was completely removed, emergence did not differ from that in control quadrats. Susceptibility to drought stress was higher for seedlings than for mature plants. Although the species does not maintain a long-term persistent soil seed bank, other factors, such as density-dependent fecundity and autogamy, may temper population fluctuations through time and reduce the probability of local extinction.

TI  - Impacts of secondary seed dispersal and herbivory on seedling survival in Aesculus turbinata
PY  - 1997
AB  - . Aesculus turbinata is a tree species with large seeds (6.2 g mean dry weight). We studied the demography of its seeds and seedlings in a temperate deciduous forest in northern Japan to elucidate the ecological significance of large seeds with special reference to herbivory and secondary dispersal. Both seed and seedling stages suffered greatly from herbivores. Seedling herbivory was important judged from experiments with shoot clipping and hypogeal cotyledon removal. However, some seedlings survived through re-sprouting after herbivory. Survival rate and percentage resprouting seedlings were lower than those with remaining cotyledons, though seedling size was not affected. This suggests that stored resources in hypogeal cotyledons are working as a kind of ‘risk hedge’ against severe aboveground shoot clipping experienced by A. turbinata. The spatial distribution of seedlings was expanded via seed scatter-hoarding by rodents. Seedling survival rate was higher within canopy gaps than under closed canopy, indicating that canopy gaps are safe sites for establishment, and was negatively correlated with seedling density. Therefore, secondary seed dispersal in this species seems to be effective in ‘finding’ safe sites and in ‘escaping’ density-dependent mortality. The large seeds and seedlings of A. turbinata are attractive to herbivores, but the high resistance of seedlings to herbivory due to large reserves and the effective secondary dispersal appear to mitigate these disadvantages.

TI  - Comparing Classical Community Models: Theoretical Consequences for Patterns of Diversity
PY  - 2002
AB  - Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency dependence resulting from species-specific pests, re- cruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation- extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model com- munities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across com- munities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative- abundance distributions are more even for systems with compet- itive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when fre- quency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed sur- prisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of com- munity-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, pa- rameterization of models such as these from field data on the

TI  - Negative density dependence mediates biodiversity-productivity relationships across scales.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Regional species diversity generally increases with primary productivity whereas local diversity–productivity relationships are highly variable. This scale-dependence of the biodiversity–productivity relationship highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that govern variation in species composition among local communities, which is known as β-diversity. Hypotheses to explain changes in β-diversity with productivity invoke multiple mechanisms operating at local and regional scales, but the relative importance of these mechanisms is unknown. Here we show that changes in the strength of local density-dependent interactions within and among tree species explain changes in β-diversity across a subcontinental-productivity gradient. Stronger conspecific relative to heterospecific negative density dependence in more productive regions was associated with higher local diversity, weaker habitat partitioning (less species sorting), and homogenization of community composition among sites (lower β-diversity). Regional processes associated with changes in species pools had limited effects on β-diversity. Our study suggests that systematic shifts in the strength of local interactions within and among species might generally contribute to some of the most prominent but poorly understood gradients in global biodiversity. The mechanisms underlying changes in biodiversity and productivity across scales are poorly understood. Here, the authors show that negative density dependence among conspecifics explains changes in β-diversity of trees across western North America.

TI  - Distance- and density-dependent recruitment of common ragwort is not driven by plant-soil feedbacks
PY  - 2024
AB  - Janzen-Connell effects state that the accumulation of host-specific natural enemies near parent plants can negatively affect their offspring. Negative plant-soil feedbacks can produce patterns of seedling performance predicted by Janzen-Connell effects and influence plant populations, but their relevance in field conditions remains unclear. Here, using spatial point-pattern analysis, we examine the spatial distribution of Jacobaea vulgaris to assess whether distance- and density-dependent predictions of Janzen-Connell effects are evident in the field. We established 27 replicated 64 m2 plots at two grassland sites and mapped positions of rosette-bearing and flowering J. vulgaris plants within each plot. To investigate temporal distribution patterns, we tracked plant positions repeatedly in three plots during a single season. Additionally, we tested whether these patterns are soil-mediated. Soil samples were collected underneath flowering plants and at a distance of 0.5 meter, and used to compare seed germination, seedling survival, and growth under controlled conditions. Furthermore, we measured J. vulgaris growth in soil from patches with high J. vulgaris densities and in soil from areas outside these patches. The density of rosette-bearing plants was lower at close distances from flowering plants than expected from null models, suggesting negative distance-dependent plant recruitment. The degree of clustering decreased over time from rosette-bearing to flowering plants, indicating density-dependent self-thinning. Seed germination was higher in soil further away from flowering J. vulgaris plants than in soil underneath plants at one site, but soil distance was not an overall significant factor in explaining seed germination. However, seedling mortality and biomass did not differ between soils collected at the two distances, and plants produced similar biomass in soil collected from inside and outside J. vulgaris patches. Our study demonstrates conspecific distance- and density-dependent plant recruitment in J. vulgaris in the field, but we found no evidence this depends on belowground natural enemies.

TI  - Spacing dynamics of a tropical rain forest tree: evaluation of the Janzen-Connell model
PY  - 1984
AB  - More than a decade ago Janzen (1970) and Connell (1971) proposed that natural enemies could be a key factor in maintaining the high tree species diversity of tropical forests. They predicted disproportionately high mortality of juvenile trees close to adults, because of host-specific seed predators, herbivores, or pathogens. Connell predicted higher progeny mortality under adult crowns because of herbivores which normally feed on adults. Janzen proposed that, in addition to such "distance-responsive" agents, density-responsive predators or pathogens will concentrate their activities near adults, where initial seed input is highest. With recruitment probability lowered near nonspecific adults, the probability of nonconspecific establishment in these sites increases. Both authors postulated that host-specific natural enemies would be particularly abundant and effective in tropical rain forests, and thus could be a significant force in maintaining the exceptionally high diversity of trees in these communities. This "Escape Hypothesis" (Howe and Smallwood 1982) was at first widely accepted, although relatively few studies had provided evidence to support it. More recently, data on spatial patterns of tropical trees have been used as a basis for rejection of the hypothesis (e.g., Hubbell 1979, 1980; Fleming and Heithaus 1981).

TI  - Bias in the detection of negative density dependence in plant communities.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Regression dilution is a statistical inference bias that causes underestimation of the strength of dependency between two variables when the predictors are error-prone proxies (EPPs). EPPs are widely used in plant community studies focused on negative density-dependence (NDD) to quantify competitive interactions. Because of the nature of the bias, conspecific NDD is often overestimated in recruitment analyses, and in some cases, can be erroneously detected when absent. In contrast, for survival analyses, EPPs typically cause NDD to be underestimated, but underestimation is more severe for abundant species and for heterospecific effects, thereby generating spurious negative relationships between the strength of NDD and the abundances of con- and heterospecifics. This can explain why many studies observed rare species to suffer more severely from conspecific NDD, and heterospecific effects to be disproportionally smaller than conspecific effects. In general, such species-dependent bias is often related to traits associated with likely mechanisms of NDD, which creates false patterns and complicates the ecological interpretation of the analyses. Classic examples taken from literature and simulations demonstrate that this bias has been pervasive, which calls into question the emerging paradigm that intraspecific competition has been demonstrated by direct field measurements to be generally stronger than interspecific competition.

TI  - Indirect interactions among tropical tree species through shared rodent seed predators: a novel mechanism of tree species coexistence.
PY  - 2015
AB  - The coexistence of numerous tree species in tropical forests is commonly explained by negative dependence of recruitment on the conspecific seed and tree density due to specialist natural enemies that attack seeds and seedlings (‘Janzen–Connell’ effects). Less known is whether guilds of shared seed predators can induce a negative dependence of recruitment on the density of different species of the same plant functional group. We studied 54 plots in tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, with contrasting mature tree densities of three coexisting large seeded tree species with shared seed predators. Levels of seed predation were far better explained by incorporating seed densities of all three focal species than by conspecific seed density alone. Both positive and negative density dependencies were observed for different species combinations. Thus, indirect interactions via shared seed predators can either promote or reduce the coexistence of different plant functional groups in tropical forest.

TI  - Consequences of frugivore-mediated seed dispersal for the spatial and genetic structures of a neotropical palm.
PY  - 2012
AB  - The idiosyncratic behaviours of seed dispersers are important contributors to plant spatial associations and genetic structures. In this study, we used a combination of field, molecular and spatial studies to examine the connections between seed dispersal and the spatial and genetic structures of a dominant neotropical palm Attalea phalerata. Field observation and genetic parentage analysis both indicated that the majority of A. phalerata seeds were dispersed locally over short distances ( 10 m) from maternal palms. Seedlings were also spatially aggregated with juveniles. These patterns are probably associated with the dispersal of seeds by rodents and the survival of recruits at specific microsites or neighbourhoods over successive fruiting periods. Our cross-cohort analyses found palms in older cohorts and cohort pairs were associated with a lower proportion of offspring and sibling neighbours and exhibited weaker spatial and genetic structures. Such patterns are consistent with increased distance- and density-dependent mortality over time among palms dispersed near maternal palms or siblings. The integrative approaches used for this study allowed us to infer the importance of seed dispersal activities in maintaining the aggregated distribution and significant genetic structures among A. phalerata palms. We further conclude that distance- and density-dependent mortality is a key postdispersal process regulating this palm population.

TI  - Density-dependent seed predation in Attalea geraensis Barb. Rodr. (Arecaceae) caused by bruchid beetles in the Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Palms are an important component of Neotropical communities as they are often diverse and abundant. In some areas, palms occur in high density and act as limiting factor in tree recruitment by limiting tree seedling and sapling abundance. In this study, I evaluated the intensity of seed mortality caused by insects in Attalea geraensis, in a large area of preserved Cerrado (Serra do Cabral, MG, Brazil) during wet season when both A. geraensis fruits and bruchid beetles were abundant. I collected a total of 63 infructescences which had from 3 fruits and 7 seeds to 82 fruits and 251 seeds. Endocarps had from 1 to 6 seeds. Seed mortality per infructescence due to beetles (Pachymerus cardo) was intense, and increases positively and disproportionally according to seed number per infructescence. Besides that, average proportions of seeds preyed upon by insects were consistently high (> 0.83), irrespective of seed number per endocarp. Positive density-dependent seed mortality caused by specialized natural enemies has been assumed to promote species rarity, an important feature of species coexistence in Neotropical forests. Then, the intense seed mortality documented in this study suggests that seed predators may contribute to the richness and diversity of plant species in the Cerrado, the richest and most endangered savanna in the world.

TI  - The Relative Importance of Fungal Infection, Conspecific Density and Environmental Heterogeneity for Seedling Survival in a Dominant Tropical Tree
PY  - 2013
AB  - A gap remains in our understanding of how host-specific fungal pathogens impact negative density dependence (NDD). Here, we investigated survival of Cinnamomum subavenium Miq. seedlings, the dominant canopy species in a seasonal tropical evergreen forest, Thailand. It is infected by a host-specific fungus that is easily identifiable in the field. We quantified the effects of conspecific seedling and adult density on fungal infection and seedling survival over a wide range of environmental heterogeneity in elevation, understory vegetation and presence of forest gaps. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for seedling survival revealed that fungal infection significantly reduced survival and had the strongest effect on seedling survival as compared with conspecific density and environmental heterogeneity. Adult conspecific density was not, however, significantly correlated with the probability of infection, and conspecific seedling density was positively associated with increased infection only at high elevations. In contrast to infection, we found a significant positive correlation between conspecific seedling density and the probability of seedling survival. Consequently, our results demonstrate that fungal infection can have major impacts on seedling survival, but not in a manner consistent with local NDD effects on seedlings, as assumed in the Janzen–Connell hypothesis. Our study provides an example of how quantifying the interaction between environmental heterogeneity and a host-specific plant-pathogen can yield unexpected insights into the dynamics of seedling populations. The combined effects of host-specific pathogens and environmental heterogeneity on survival of dominant seedling species may ultimately provide a chance for rarer species to recruit.

TI  - Soil biota increase the likelihood for coexistence among competing plant species.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Theory predicts that stable species coexistence will occur when population growth rates of competitively dominant species are suppressed when at high conspecific density. Although there is now compelling evidence that plant communities exhibit negative density dependence, the relative importance of the underlying processes leading to these patterns is rarely tested. We coupled reciprocal greenhouse and field experiments with community dynamics modeling to untangle the relative importance of soil biota from competition as stabilizing forces to coexistence. We found that (1) plant-soil biotic interactions compared to competitive interactions were stronger stabilizing forces, (2) only the strength of plant-soil biotic interactions was dependent on plant evolutionary history, and (3) the variation in the strength of plant-soil biotic interactions was correlated with relative abundance patterns in an opposite way than was the variation in the strength of competitive interactions. Collectively, our results demonstrate the fundamental role soil biota have in maintaining plant community diversity.

TI  - Conspecific plants are better 'nurses' than rocks: consistent results revealing intraspecific facilitation as a process that promotes establishment in a hyper-arid environment.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Harsh environmental conditions in arid ecosystems limit seedling recruitment to microhabitats under nurse structures, such as shrubs or rocks. These structures, however, do not necessarily afford the same benefits to plants because nurse rocks provide only physical nurse effects, whereas nurse plants can provide both physical and biological nurse effects. Nevertheless, if the nurse plant is a conspecific, the benefits it provides may be outweighed by higher mortality due to negative density-dependent processes; consequently, negative density-dependence is expected to limit plants from acting as nurses to their own seedlings. The degree to which an abiotic nurse may be more beneficial than a conspecific one remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the role and elucidate the mechanisms by which conspecific plants and rocks promote plant establishment in a hyper-arid desert. For 4 years, we examined establishment patterns of Myrcianthes coquimbensis (Myrtaceae), a threatened desert shrub that recruits solely in rock cavities and under conspecific shrubs. Specifically, we characterized these microhabitats, as well as open interspaces for comparison, and conducted germination, seed removal and seedling survival experiments. Our results revealed that conspecific shrubs and nurse rocks modified environmental conditions in similar ways; soil and air temperatures were lower, and water availability was higher than in open interspaces. We found no evidence on negative density-dependent recruitment: seed removal was lowest and seedling emergence highest under conspecific plants, moreover seedling survival probabilities were similar in rock cavities and under conspecific plants. We conclude that the probability of establishment was highest under conspecific plants than in other microhabitats, contrasting what is expected under the Janzen-Connell recruitment model. We suggest that for species living in stressful environments, population regulation may be a function of positive density-dependence and intraspecific facilitation may be a process that promotes the persistence of some plant species within a community.

TI  - The Relative Importance of Pre- and Post-germination Determinants for Recruitment of an Annual Plant Community on Moving Sandy Land
PY  - 2005
AB  - • Background and Aims The relative importance of pre- and post-germination determinants for recruitment of natural plant communities is rarely explored. An annual plant community on moving sandy land was chosen for a case study. Answers to the following questions were sought: (a) Does recruitment of new individuals within the community of annual plants differ in time and space? (b) Is there spatial concordance between seed deposition, seedling emergence, survival and recruitment? (c) What are the direct and indirect effects of pre- and post-germination determinants on plant recruitment.

• Methods An integrative approach combining investigation of natural recruitment processes with regression, correlation and path analyses was adopted. Data on seed deposition and seedling recruitment were collected by monitoring the number of seeds deposited in the top 5 cm of the soil and the numbers of seedlings emerged and recruited from all annual plants at sites to a range of distances from the existing shrub Artemisia halodendron (Asteraceae) in eight compass directions for two consecutive growing seasons.

• Key Results Community-level recruitment was strongly affected by inter-annual rainfall variation and was highly site- and density-dependent. Low recruitment rate in this system was due to low emergence rate and low post-emergence survival rate. Of the pre- and post-germination determinants studied, it was the number of seedlings which emerged and the post-emergence survival rate that had the greatest direct effects on recruitment, with a combination of both variables explaining the majority of the variance (97 %) in recruitment.

• Conclusions This study suggests that post-germination determinants (emergence and survival) rather than pre-germination determinants (seed deposition) substantially determined the final pattern of recruitment. Although the density of seeds deposited did not have a significant direct effect on recruitment, it contributed to observed variation in recruitment indirectly through density-dependent emergence of seedlings.

TI  - Seed-density effects on germination and initial seedling establishment in eelgrass Zostera marina in the Chesapeake Bay region
PY  - 2003
AB  - The influence of Zostera marina L. seed-density on germination and initial seedling success was investigated using seed-addition field experiments at 2 scales in the Chesapeake Bay region in 1999 and 2000. We first tested whether germination rates and initial seedling establishment were affected by initial seed-densities of 2.5, 25, 250, and 1250 seeds m -2 within 4 m 2 plots. We then tested ' whether plot size affects germination rates, following the hypothesis that rates of seed predation might be different in large and small plots. We broadcast seeds at a single density (500 seeds m -2 ) but at a much larger plot size (100 m 2 , or 25 times the size of the small plots). In the spring following seed broadcast, seedlings were present in most 4 m 2 plots (seedling densities of 0.6 to 15.4 % of the number of seeds released in 1999, and 3.3 to 23.3 % of those released in 2000) and in all 100 m 2 plots (4.3 % to 13.9%). Seed-density effects were not significant in 1999 or 2000, while site effects were significant in both years. The percentages of seedlings in the larger plots were similar to those in the smaller plots. These results suggest that there were no density-dependent effects on germination and initial seedling establishment, and that within the size range of plots examined in this study, such processes are not likely to be scale-dependent. The significant differences among the sites may be related to micro-topographic complexities of the bottom caused by both biotic and abiotic factors that allow seeds to be retained close to where they settle. Our data, combined with previously published data on seed dispersal and patch dynamics, stress the importance of conserving existing beds, regardless of bed size and shoot density, since these are sources of seeds that may establish new patches. The data may also help in developing strategies for the restoration of denuded sites using seeds instead of adult plants.

TI  - How does habitat filtering affect the detection of conspecific and phylogenetic density dependence
PY  - 2016
AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) has been recognized as a key mechanism underlying species coexistence, especially in tropical forests. Recently, some studies have reported that seedling survival is also negatively correlated with the phylogenetic relatedness between neighbors and focal individuals, termed phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD). In contrast to CNDD or PNDD, shared habitat requirements between closely related individuals are thought to be a cause of observed positive effects of closely related neighbors, which may affect the strength and detectability of CNDD or PNDD. In order to investigate the relative importance of these mechanisms for tropical tree seedling survival, we used generalized linear mixed models to analyze how the survival of more than 10 000 seedlings of woody plant species related to neighborhood and habitat variables in a tropical rainforest in southwest China. By comparing models with and without habitat variables, we tested how habitat filtering affected the detection of CNDD and PNDD. The best-fitting model suggested that CNDD and habitat filtering played key roles in seedling survival; but that, contrary to our expectations, phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD) had a distinct and important effect. While habitat filtering affected the detection of CNDD by decreasing its apparent strength, it did not explain the positive effects of closely related neighbors. Our results demonstrate that a failure to control for habitat variables and phylogenetic relationships may obscure the importance of conspecific and heterospecific neighbor densities for seedling survival.

TI  - The demography of tree species response to climate: seedling recruitment and survival
PY  - 2016
AB  - Seedling recruitment and survival are critical bottlenecks in tree population dynamics and are likely to play central roles in shifts in species distributions under climate change. We use data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program to quantify the relationships between two key climate variables—mean annual temperature and growing season water deficit—and rates of seedling recruitment and survival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our statistical models include the positive effects of conspecific adult abundance on recruitment and the potentially negative competitive effects of total canopy abundance on seedling survival. The tradeoff between these two effects creates a range from positive to negative conspecific density dependence, depending on the absolute and relative abundance of conspecific vs. heterospecific adults in a plot. Variation along the climate gradients mirrors patterns found previously in adult distributions. The clearest signal is in variation in the presence/absence of seedlings, while seedling density when present is only weakly related to local climate. The relatively narrow niche breadths for the presence of both seedlings and adults suggest that the frequency of occurrence of species within the landscape, rather than their relative abundance when present, will show the greatest response to climate change. Our analyses predict seedling survival as a function of mean annual temperature independent of the effects of competition and water deficit and thus provide an indication of the fundamental niche for seedling distribution along the temperature gradient. For more than half of the 50 species, their realized seedling niches are displaced to warmer climates. This reflects the prevalence of species in which survival declines with increasing temperature across a significant portion of at least their southern range. Our results show that when the effects of warmer climates are taken into account, seedling survival generally increases with increasing water deficit in the generally humid climates of the eastern United States. This result is consistent with recent global surveys of the relationship between net primary productivity and forest turnover rates, but contrasts with recent studies highlighting the potential impact of drought stress on tree mortality in more arid climates.

TI  - Diversity and abundance of insect herbivores foraging on seedlings in a rainforest in Guyana
PY  - 1999
AB  - Summary

1. Free-living insect herbivores foraging on 10 000 tagged seedlings representing five species of common rainforest trees were surveyed monthly for more than 1 year in an unlogged forest plot of 1 km2 in Guyana.



2. Overall, 9056 insect specimens were collected. Most were sap-sucking insects, which represented at least 244 species belonging to 25 families. Leaf-chewing insects included at least 101 species belonging to 16 families. Herbivore densities were among the lowest densities reported in tropical rainforests to date: 2.4 individuals per square metre of foliage.



3. Insect host specificity was assessed by calculating Lloyd’s index of patchiness from distributional records and considering feeding records in captivity and in situ. Generalists represented 84 and 78% of sap-sucking species and individuals, and 75 and 42% of leaf-chewing species and individuals. In particular, several species of polyphagous xylem-feeding Cicadellinae were strikingly abundant on all hosts.



4. The high incidence of generalist insects suggests that the Janzen–Connell model, explaining rates of attack on seedlings as a density-dependent process resulting from contagion of specialist insects from parent trees, is unlikely to be valid in this study system.



5. Given the rarity of flushing events for the seedlings during the study period, the low insect densities, and the high proportion of generalists, the data also suggest that seedlings may represent a poor resource for free-living insect herbivores in rainforests.

TI  - Loss of animal seed dispersal increases extinction risk in a tropical tree species due to pervasive negative density dependence across life stages.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Overhunting in tropical forests reduces populations of vertebrate seed dispersers. If reduced seed dispersal has a negative impact on tree population viability, overhunting could lead to altered forest structure and dynamics, including decreased biodiversity. However, empirical data showing decreased animal-dispersed tree abundance in overhunted forests contradict demographic models which predict minimal sensitivity of tree population growth rate to early life stages. One resolution to this discrepancy is that seed dispersal determines spatial aggregation, which could have demographic consequences for all life stages. We tested the impact of dispersal loss on population viability of a tropical tree species, Miliusa horsfieldii, currently dispersed by an intact community of large mammals in a Thai forest. We evaluated the effect of spatial aggregation for all tree life stages, from seeds to adult trees, and constructed simulation models to compare population viability with and without animal-mediated seed dispersal. In simulated populations, disperser loss increased spatial aggregation by fourfold, leading to increased negative density dependence across the life cycle and a 10-fold increase in the probability of extinction. Given that the majority of tree species in tropical forests are animal-dispersed, overhunting will potentially result in forests that are fundamentally different from those existing now.

TI  - Evidence of species-specific neighborhood effects in the dipterocarpaceae of a Bornean rain forest
PY  - 2005
AB  - Although accumulating evidence indicates that local intraspecific density-dependent effects are not as rare in species-rich communities as previously suspected, there are still very few detailed and systematic neighborhood analyses of species-rich communities. Here, we provide such an analysis with the overall goal of quantifying the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific interaction strength in a primary, lowland dipterocarp forest located at Danum, Sabah, Malaysia. Using data on 10 abundant overstory dipterocarp species from two 4-ha permanent plots, we evaluated the effects of neighbors on the absolute growth rate of focal trees (from 1986 to 1996) over increasing neighborhood radii (from 1 to 20 m) with multiple regressions. Only trees 10 cm to > 100 cm girth at breast height in 1986 were considered as focal trees. Among neighborhood models with one neighbor term, models including only conspecific larger trees performed best in five out of 10 species. Negative effects of conspecific larger neighbors were most apparent in large overstory species such as those of the genus Shorea. However, neighborhood models with separate terms and radii for heterospecific and conspecific neighbors accounted for more variability in absolute growth rates than did neighborhood models with one neighbor term. The conspecific term was significant for nine out of 10 species. Moreover, in five out of 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors had significantly higher absolute growth rates than trees with conspecific neighbors. Averaged over the 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors grew 32.4 cm(2) in basal area from 1986 to 1996, whereas trees with conspecific neighbors only grew 14.7 cm(2) in basal area, although there was no difference in initial basal area between trees in the two groups. Averaged across the six species of the genus Shorea, negative effects of conspecific larger trees were significantly stronger than for heterospecific larger neighbors.

TI  - Divergent Secondary Metabolites and Habitat Filtering Both Contribute to Tree Species Coexistence in the Peruvian Amazon
PY  - 2018
AB  - Little is known about the mechanisms promoting or limiting the coexistence of functionally divergent species in hyperdiverse tropical tree genera. Density-dependent enemy attacks have been proposed to be a major driver for the local coexistence of chemically divergent congeneric species. At the same time, we expect local soil conditions to favor the coexistence of species sharing similar functional traits related to resource use strategies, while environmental heterogeneity would promote the diversity of these traits at both local and large spatial scales. To test how these traits mediate species coexistence, we used functional trait data for 29 species from the tree genus Protium (Burseraceae), collected in 19 plots (2 ha each) in the Peruvian Amazon. We characterized the presence-absence of 189 plant secondary metabolites (SM) for 27 of these species, and 14 functional traits associated with resource use strategies (RUT) for 16 species. Based on these data, we found that SM were significantly more dissimilar than null expectations for species co-occurring within plots, whereas RUT were significantly more similar. These results were consistent with the hypothesis that density-dependent enemy attacks contribute to the local coexistence of congeneric species displaying divergent chemical defenses, whereas local habitat conditions filter species with similar RUT. Using measurements of nine soil properties in each plot, we also found a significant turnover of RUT traits with increasing dissimilarity of soil texture and nutrient availabilities, providing support for the hypothesis that soil heterogeneity maintains functional diversity at larger spatial scales (from 500 m up to ca. 200 km) in Protium communities. Our study provides new evidence suggesting that density-dependent enemy attacks and soil heterogeneity both contribute to maintaining high species richness in diverse tropical forests.

TI  - Plant pathogens drive density‐dependent seedling mortality in a tropical tree
PY  - 2006
AB  - One explanation for the extraordinary diversity of tropical forest trees is that density-dependent mortality from herbivores or pathogens puts locally rare species at an advantage. Density-dependent mortality of seeds and small seedlings is particularly intense in tropical forests, but its causes remain uncertain. Here, we show experimentally that pathogens from the Oomycota are associated with intense mortality in seedlings of a neotropical tree, Sebastiana longicuspis. Seedlings in untreated plots experienced eight times higher mortality compared with seedlings in plots treated with fungicide. Mortality was strongly density dependent: in fungicide-treated plots survival was unaffected by density, but survival in unsprayed plots was over three times higher at low density. Density-dependent mortality observed in a simultaneous, non-manipulative study was highly transient, suggesting that short-term observational studies may underestimate the intensity and form of pathogen-induced mortality. If such effects are widespread, plant pathogens may play a key role in maintaining and structuring tropical diversity.

TI  - Density Dependence in Two Understory Tree Species in a Neotropical Forest
PY  - 1994
AB  - Density dependence was examined in two species of neotropical treelets, Faramea occidentalis and Desmopsis panamensis, in a 50—ha plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Survival and growth probability of plants larger than 1 cm dbh (diameter at breast height), and recruitment into the 1—cm class, were assessed as a function of the number of conspecific neighbors in various distance and size classes. Density—dependent effects on survival and growth were strong in Faramea. Performance of 1—8 cm dbh plants declined with increasing numbers of adult neighbors within 1 m, 1—2 m, and 2—4 m, but neighbors at 4—6 had no effect. Performance also declined with increasing numbers of juvenile neighbors <4f cm dbh, but the effect was less pronounced. Saplings of Faramea grew poorly in areas of high juvenile density within 30 m, independent of the effects caused by neighbors within 4 m. In contrast to Faramea, Desmopsis showed no density dependence in survival nor in growth. For recruitment, however, the two species s...

TI  - Experimental Studies of Seedling Recruitment from Contrasting Seed Distributions
PY  - 1992
AB  - To examine how selection may act on seed dispersal, we experimentally manipulated seed distributions and compared levels and patterns of seedling recruitment in three altered distributions, relative to the nonmanipulated, leptokurtic distribution. We picked up, then redistributed the wind-dispersed seeds of two isolated parents of Tachigalia versicolor, a tropical tree species growing on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Three experimental distributions were created in long columns adjacent to or well beyond the undisturbed column of the natural distribution: (1) a nonleptokurtic "even" distribution of uniform density equal to the mean density throughout the natural column, (2) a "mixed" distribution with the same total number and kurtosis as the natural column, but composed of an equal proportion of seeds from the two parent trees, and (3) an "extended-tail" distribution spread in low uniform density up to 1.8 km beyond the natural distribution. Thus, the study addressed the relative importance of density, distance, and genetic makeup on offspring recruitment. The results of the 2 yr observations of seed and seedling survival indicate that, relative to the natural distribution, seedling recruitment at 2 yr was greater in the even distribution, was minimally affected by a mixture of genotypes from overlapping distributions of two parent trees, and was very infrequent from seeds dispersed to a wide variety of distant sites. Although the mixture of genotypes from overlapping distributions did enhance the probability of survival at one site, that effect occurred only during the seedling and not the seed stage. For the extended-tail and mixed distributions, in which offspring of both parents occurred at both sites, the impact of site differences (survival in Site A tail > Site B tail; survival in Site A mixed > Site B mixed) exceeded that of parent differences (Parent A > Parent B). The major differences among distributions arose in the seed and early seedling stages (<2 mo), and were due to heavy mortality primarily from seed predators (postdispersal by terrestrial mammals) and mammalian herbivores eating young seedlings. Mammalian predation and herbivory were particularly heavy in the extended-tail distributions. It ap- peared that either predator satiation and/or incomplete searching occurred in the three, much more dense distributions adjacent to the parent trees. In contrast, density-dependent mortality at the spatial scale of -iM2 experimental quadrats was limited to very high densities and occurred only in early seedling stages (0-2 mo). Distance effects on the probability of survival were inconsistent both between sites and among distributions. However, the absolute number of seedlings surviving at 2 yr declined with distance from the parent in all three distributions, except the even distribution at Tree A. Additionally, seedling recruitment at any distance < 100 m from the parent for all three distributions greatly exceeded recruitment at extended-tail (100-1800 m) sites. In summary, offspring recruitment was enhanced by the high cohort density at a large spatial scale (i.e., within a circle of 100 m radius) because of predator satiation. At the same time, it was enhanced slightly by the evenness of the distribution within this scale because of density-dependent mortality at a smaller spatial scale (i.e., 1 M2). Therefore, we conclude that selection on dispersal by Tachigalia versicolor on BCI should act to increase the uniformity of the seed distribution, but not to increase dispersal distance to the point that the density of the seed shadow is diluted.

TI  - The role of herbivorous insects and pathogens in the regeneration dynamics of Guazuma ulmifolia in Panama
PY  - 2019
AB  - A significant proportion of the mortality of rainforest trees occurs during early life stages (seeds and seedlings), but mortality agents are often elusive. Our study investigated the role of herbivorous insects and pathogens in the early regeneration dynamics of Guazuma ulmifolia (Malvaceae), an important tree species in agroforestry in Central America. We reared pre-dispersal insect seed predators from G. ulmifolia seeds in Panama. We also carried out an experiment, controlling insects and pathogens using insecticide and/or fungicide treatments, as well as seed density, and compared survivorship of G. ulmifolia seeds and seedlings among treatments and relative to untreated control plots. We observed (1) high pre-dispersal attack (92%) of the fruits of G. ulmifolia, mostly by anobiine and bruchine beetles; (2) negligible post-dispersal attack of isolated seeds by insects and pathogens; (3) slow growth and high mortality (> 95%) of seedlings after 14 weeks; (4) low insect damage on seedlings; and (5) a strong positive correlation between seedling mortality and rainfall. We conclude that for G. ulmifolia at our study site the pre-dispersal seed stage is by far the most sensitive stage to insects and that their influence on seedling mortality appears to be slight as compared to that of inclement weather. Thus, the regeneration of this important tree species may depend on effective primary dispersal of seeds by vertebrates (before most of the seed crop is lost to insects), conditioned by suitable conditions in which the seedlings can grow.

TI  - Functional responses of contrasting seed predator guilds to masting in two Mediterranean oak species
PY  - 2017
AB  - The predator satiation hypothesis poses that synchronous and variable seed production during masting events increases seed escape through seed predator satiation. The success of this strategy depends upon the type of consumer functional response, in this case defined as the change in seed consumption rate by a predator as a function of change in seed density. Type II (where the proportion of seed consumed is highest at low levels of seed availability) and type III (where the proportion of seed consumed is highest at some intermediate level of seed availability and then declines towards zero) functional responses describe negative density-dependence and indicate predator satiation. The type of function response should be contingent upon herbivore traits: type II responses are predicted for dietary specialist predators with low mobility, and type III responses are predicted for highly mobile, dietary generalist predators. Surprisingly, most studies have not evaluated whether functional responses vary among seed predator guilds. Here we describe the functional responses at population and individual tree level of highly mobile generalist (birds and rodents) and less mobile specialist (insects) pre-dispersal seed predators attacking acorns of two sympatric oaks (Quercus suber and Q. canariensis) over a 10-year period. Our results showed that in most cases specialist seed predators exhibited the predicted type II functional response at both the individual tree and population level for both oak species. However, generalist seed predators did not exhibit the predicted type III response; instead, they also exhibited a type II response at the individual tree and population level for both oak species. By independently assessing the effects of multiple seed predators associated with the same host tree species, our work highlights the influence of herbivore traits on the outcome of plant–seed predator interactions in masting species, and thus furthers our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying masting behaviour.

TI  - Density dependence and habitat heterogeneity regulate seedling survival in a North American temperate forest
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Survival and growth of forest tree seedlings are influenced by many abiotic and biotic forces that may vary across space and time. The simultaneous influences of habitat heterogeneity, temporal environmental variability (including disturbance regimes), and biotic interactions are difficult to disentangle, yet understanding the relative importance of these factors for tree seedling dynamics is critical for conservation of forest biodiversity. Most long term, spatially explicit studies of tree seedling ecology have been set in the tropics; much less attention has been given to tree seedlings in temperate forests. We monitored the survival of over 3000 individual seedlings over an eight-year period in a temperate forest in northeast Wisconsin, USA. Results from four seedling censuses demonstrated that both conspecific density and environmental variables significantly affected seedling survival. Higher densities of conspecific trees consistently reduced the probability of seedling survival over time. At the community level, relatively common species were negatively influenced by neighboring conspecific trees and exhibited higher per capita and per basal area mortality. The negative impacts of high conspecific tree density were most pronounced in areas of higher light and moisture, but these interactions varied over time, as did the importance of other abiotic variables. Patterns of less common species were more clearly explained by abiotic variables, with shifting relevance of specific variables according to species abundance. Conspecific negative density dependence, which interacts with resource gradients, and habitat conditions that shift over time are influencing community composition in this northern temperate forest.

TI  - Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density-dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting Inga (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.

TI  - Landscape-scale density-dependent recruitment of oaks in planted forests: more is not always better.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Plant colonization studies usually address density-dependent processes in the narrow sense of recruitment constraints due to negative density-dependent seed and seedling mortality. However, complex density-dependent effects may be involved in additional stages of the recruitment process. We hypothesized that seed arrival and seedling establishment are influenced by density dependence acting at small scales at the site of colonization, and at larger scales as a function of the colonizing species' landscape abundance. These hypotheses were tested in a study of colonization of pine forests by oaks in a heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape. Maximum-likelihood models show that density effects switch from positive to negative along the range of landscape-scale oak seed source abundance. Contrary to expectations, high seed source densities limited oak recruitment, suggesting a landscape-scale Janzen-Connell effect. We propose a range of mechanisms that generate positive or negative density dependence during colonization, resulting in nonlinear density-dependent feedbacks that can generate unexpected colonization patterns.

TI  - Evaluating management interventions in small populations of a perennial herb Primula vulgaris using spatio-temporal analyses of point patterns
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary


1. In high-intensity agricultural landscapes, small landscape elements such as hedgerows, ditch banks, and rows of pollard trees may represent the last refuge of many plant and animal species, some of them being rare or even threatened with extinction. However, due to their small size and low habitat quality, long-term population survival cannot be ascertained and often active management is needed to maintain viable populations of species forced to survive in these small landscape elements.



2. Population models are needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to evaluate alternative management actions. Here, we present a methodology to evaluate management interventions using spatio-temporal analyses of point patterns. We apply this method to several populations of primrose Primula vulgaris in Flanders, where it is rare and predominantly occurs along ditch banks.



3. The effects of ditch bank clearing on the establishment success of seedlings was investigated by comparing spatial patterns of seedling recruitment, survival and mortality between populations that were grazed and populations that were severely disturbed by mechanical clearing of ditch banks followed by annual mowing. A total of 884 seedlings were mapped and monitored during 4 consecutive years (1999–2002).



4. In all populations, plants showed significant clustering, but in cleared sites only seedlings were significantly clustered around adults. Spatial patterns of mortality varied according to the management intervention. In grazed sites, mortality was almost random, whereas in cleared sites we found clear evidence for strong negative density-dependent mortality. There was no evidence that the presence of adults affected survival of recruits in any of the sites studied.



5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the analysis of spatial point patterns contributes to our understanding of the population dynamics of plant species occurring in different environments. The approach can be broadly applied to other plant species to elucidate the processes that determine the number of individuals that establish and persist into later life stages and will help conservation managers to refine management strategies intended to conserve or restore plant populations. In the case of P. vulgaris, increasing the availability of microsites is most likely to result in increased growth rates, as it results in increased recruitment and establishment of recruits.

TI  - Positive density-dependent reproduction regulated by local kinship and size in an understorey tropical tree.
PY  - 2015
AB  - � Background and Aims Global pollinator declines and continued habitat fragmentation highlight the critical need to understand reproduction and gene flow across plant populations. Plant size, conspecific density and local kinship (i.e. neighbourhood genetic relatedness) have been proposed as important mechanisms influencing the reproductive success of flowering plants, but have rarely been simultaneously investigated. � Methods We conducted this study on a continuous population of the understorey tree Miconia affinis in the Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island in central Panama. We used spatial, reproductive and population genetic data to investigate the effects of tree size, conspecific neighbourhood density and local kinship on maternal and paternal reproductive success. We used a Bayesian framework to simultaneously model the effects of our explanatory variables on the mean and variance of maternal viable seed set and siring success. � Key Results Our results reveal that large trees had lower proportions of viable seeds in their fruits but sired more seeds. We documented differential effects of neighbourhood density and local kinship on both maternal and paternal reproductive components. Trees in more dense neighbourhoods produced on average more viable seeds, although this positive density effect was influenced by variance-inflation with increasing local kinship. Neighbourhood density did not have significant effects on siring success. � Conclusions This study is one of the first to reveal an interaction among tree size, conspecific density and local kinship as critical factors differentially influencing maternal and paternal reproductive success. We show that both maternal and paternal reproductive success should be evaluated to determine the population-level and individual traits most essential for plant reproduction. In addition to conserving large trees, we suggest the inclusion of small trees and the conservation of dense patches with low kinship as potential strategies for strengthening the reproductive status of tropical trees.

TI  - Positive tree diversity effect on fine root biomass: via density dependence rather than spatial root partitioning
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>The importance of species richness to ecosystem functioning and services is a central tenet of biological conservation. However, most of our theory and mechanistic understanding is based on diversity found aboveground. Our study sought to better understand the relationship between diversity and belowground function by studying root biomass across a plant diversity gradient. We collected soil cores from 91 plots with between 1 and 12 aboveground tree species in three natural secondary forests to measure fine root (≤ 2 mm in diameter) biomass. Molecular methods were used to identify the tree species of fine roots and to estimate fine root biomass for each species. This study tested whether the spatial root partitioning (species differ by belowground territory) and symmetric growth (the capacity to colonize nutrient‐rich hotspots) underpin the relationship between aboveground species richness and fine root biomass. All species preferred to grow in nutrient‐rich areas and symmetric growth could explain the positive relationship between aboveground species richness and fine root biomass. However, symmetric growth only appeared in the nutrient‐rich upper soil layer (0–10 cm). Structural equation modelling indicated that aboveground species richness and stand density significantly affected fine root biomass. Specifically, fine root biomass depended on the interaction between aboveground species richness and stand density, with fine root biomass increasing with species richness at lower stand density, but not at higher stand density. Overall, evidence for spatial (i.e. vertical) root partitioning was inconsistent; assumingly any roots growing into deeper unexplored soil layers were not sufficient contributors to the positive diversity–function relationship. Alternatively, density‐dependent biotic interactions affecting tree recruitment are an important driver affecting productivity in diverse subtropical forests but the usual root distribution patterns in line with the spatial root partitioning hypothesis are unrealistic in contexts where soil nutrients are heterogeneously distributed.</jats:p>

TI  - Tree species traits affect which natural enemies drive the Janzen-Connell effect in a temperate forest.
PY  - 2020
AB  - A prominent tree species coexistence mechanism suggests host-specific natural enemies inhibit seedling recruitment at high conspecific density (negative conspecific density dependence). Natural-enemy-mediated conspecific density dependence affects numerous tree populations, but its strength varies substantially among species. Understanding how conspecific density dependence varies with species’ traits and influences the dynamics of whole communities remains a challenge. Using a three-year manipulative community-scale experiment in a temperate forest, we show that plant-associated fungi, and to a lesser extent insect herbivores, reduce seedling recruitment and survival at high adult conspecific density. Plant-associated fungi are primarily responsible for reducing seedling recruitment near conspecific adults in ectomycorrhizal and shade-tolerant species. Insects, in contrast, primarily inhibit seedling recruitment of shade-intolerant species near conspecific adults. Our results suggest that natural enemies drive conspecific density dependence in this temperate forest and that which natural enemies are responsible depends on the mycorrhizal association and shade tolerance of tree species. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis posits that seedlings may be less likely to establish near conspecifics due to shared natural enemies. Here, Jia et al. show that tree species traits determine whether fungal pathogens or insect herbivores inhibit seedling recruitment and survival in a temperate forest.

TI  - Drought stress and tropical forest woody seedlings: effect on community structure and composition
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary 1 We hypothesized that severe drought affects the structure of tropical forests by favouring seedlings of some species or groups at the expense of others. To test this hypothesis, we irrigated naturally occurring woody seedlings during an El Nino-related drought in seasonal moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We predicted that irrigated plots would retain greater species richness than control plots, and that the benefits of irrigation would increase with the abundance of: trees relative to lianas, wet-forest seedlings relative to dry-forest seedlings, and rare species relative to common species. We also hypothesized that the strength of this filter would increase with increased moisture limitation, predicting that the benefits of irrigation would increase with seedling density and light availability, and decrease with mean seedling age. 2 Irrigation did reduce species losses, but not by limiting the loss of drought-sensitive species as predicted. Instead, mortality in irrigated plots was density dependent, whereas species losses in control plots were well predicted by random thinning, suggesting that density dependence weakened as abiotic stress increased. 3 Irrigation increased seedling growth, but did not affect seedling mortality. Contrary to our predictions, irrigation increased growth in plots dominated by dry-forest species relative to those dominated by wet-forest species, suggesting that dry-forest seedlings either occur in moisture-limited microsites or are more able to utilize dry-season precipitation. The strength of the filter did increase with potential moisture limitation, as irrigation increased seedling growth more in higher light environments. 4 Annual precipitation has declined over much of the humid tropics during the 20th century. Our results suggest that this trend may reduce tropical forest diversity by weakening density-dependent mechanisms that maintain diversity. In addition, plots dominated by dry-forest species experienced higher growth in response to irrigation and also far lower dry-season mortality relative to plots dominated by wet-forest species. While we cannot disentangle the effects of microsite from species composition, these results suggest that dry-forest species may benefit from any increase in dry season length or severity. 5 Research conducted during ‘normal’ conditions may overlook the impact of severe events and thus fail to identify critical mechanisms structuring ecological communities.

TI  - Seedling density dependence regulated by population density and habitat filtering: Evidence from a mixed primary broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Northeastern China
PY  - 2018
AB  - The effects of distance dependence, negative density dependence (NDD), phylogenetic density dependence, and habitat filtering were integrated to provide additional evidence in temperate forest tree seedling survival. The main focus of this study was to explore how population density and habitat filtering regulate NDD. An approach involving four classes of population density and three classes of soil moisture was tested, including the effect of habitat variables to more accurately evaluate the underlying ecological processes affecting the density dependence of seedlings.
 NDD is an important mechanism for the maintenance of species diversity across multiple life stages, particularly during seedling recruitment. By regulating specific population structures to maintain species diversity, the effects of density dependence and distance dependence are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Nevertheless, the contribution of NDD to community assembly, relative to other processes such as habitat filtering, remains a subject of debate. Recently, it has been reported that seedling survivals are also negatively correlated with phylogenetic relatedness between neighbors and focal individuals. This effect is known as phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD). However, another opposite effect known as phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD) has also been reported to exist. The objectives of this study are to examine the following: (i) how population density affects negative density dependence (NDD); (ii) how habitat filtering regulates the NDD; (iii) whether more evidence can be found for PNDD or PPDD and why; and (iv) whether the intensity of negative density dependence is affected by the distance between parent trees and seedlings. The study was conducted in a 20-ha primary mixed broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain of China. We used generalized linear mixed models to analyze how the seedling survival of 23 woody plant species relates to neighborhoods and habitat variables. Four models were established with and without habitat variables, and two of the four models were used to test how different population densities of focal seedlings and different gradients of habitat variable regulated negative density dependence. The following results were obtained: (1) the strongest conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) was found within a radius of 15 m; (2) seedling survival were most strongly impacted by the density of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors in habitats with relatively low soil moisture; (3) the effect of seedling-seedling CNDD was especially significant, when densities ranged from 20 to 40 seedlings/4 m2, and (4) there were some evidences of phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD), and the effect of seedling-seedling PPDD was increasing with an increase in soil moisture. Our results demonstrate that conspecific negative density dependence played an important role in seedling survival, which is closely related to habitat filtering and population density. However, we found some evidences of phylogenetic positive density dependence. We suggest that future studies of neighborhood density dependence should increase awareness of evolutionary relationships.

Although density of rodents differed greatly between seasons, more rodents were always captured in mesic Sasa sp. patches with dense foliage than in wet Lysichiton sp. patches. In the season with fewer rodents, they cached seeds close to the original places irrespective of vegetation, while in the season with abundant rodents, they transported seeds further and cached seeds disproportionately in Lysichiton patches. Seeds missed by rodents were larger than seeds that were eaten or that survived. Sasa patches are more suitable for seedlings to establish and a size advantage was observed there, but even small seeds could establish in Lysichiton patches, although seedling success was lower. We concluded that maternal plants of Symplocarpus renifolius increase their reproductive success by having small t...

TI  - Seed-predator satiation and Janzen-Connell effects vary with spatial scales for seed-feeding insects
PY  - 2016
AB  - Author(s): Xiao, Zhishu; Mi, Xiangcheng; Holyoak, Marcel; Xie, Wenhua; Cao, Ke; Yang, Xifu; Huang, Xiaoqun; Krebs, Charles J | Abstract: Background and aimsThe Janzen-Connell model predicts that common species suffer high seed predation from specialized natural enemies as a function of distance from parent trees, and consequently as a function of conspecific density, whereas the predator satiation hypothesis predicts that seed attack is reduced due to predator satiation at high seed densities. Pre-dispersal predation by insects was studied while seeds are still on parent trees, which represents a frequently overlooked stage in which seed predation occurs.MethodsReproductive tree density and seed production were investigated from ten Quercus serrata populations located in south-west China, quantifying density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation over two years by three insect groups.Key resultsAcorn infestation was nearly twice as high in the low-seed year as that in the high-seed year, with considerable spatio-temporal variation in the direction and magnitude of density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation evident. Across whole populations of trees, a high density of reproductive trees caused predator satiation and reduced insect attack in the high-seed year. Within individual trees, and consistent with the Janzen-Connell model, overall insect seed predation was positively correlated with seed production in the low-seed year. In addition, there was variation among insect taxa, with positive density-dependent seed predation by Curculio weevils in the high-seed year and moths in the low-seed year, but apparent density independence by Cyllorhynchites weevils in both years.ConclusionsThe overall trend of negative density-dependent, pre-dispersal seed predation suggests that predator satiation limited the occurrence of Janzen-Connell effects across Q. serrata populations. Such effects may have large impacts on plant population dynamics and tree diversity, depending on the extent to which they are reduced by counteracting positive density-dependent predation for seeds on individual trees and other factors affecting successful recruitment.

TI  - Large trees are surrounded by more heterospecific neighboring trees in Korean pine broad-leaved natural forests.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Negative conspecific density dependence is one of the principal mechanisms affecting plant performance and community spatial patterns. Although many studies identified the prevalence of density dependent effects in various vegetation types by analyzing conspecific spatial dispersal patterns (spatial patterning) of forest trees, interactions between individuals and heterospecific neighboring trees caused by density-dependent effects are often neglected. The effects of negative density dependence lead us to expect that neighbourhood species segregation would increase with increasing tree size and that larger trees would be surrounded by more heterospecific neighbours than would smaller trees. We studied four mapped 1-Ha plots on Changbaishan Mountain in North-eastern China and used marked point pattern analysis to explore whether trees of different sizes exhibited differences in neighbourhood species segregation; we also determined whether larger trees were more likely to have heterospecific neighbours than smaller trees were. Our results show that bigger trees generally have higher species mingling levels. Neighborhood species segregation ranged from lower than expected levels to random or nearly random patterns at small scales as tree size classes increased under heterogeneous Poisson null model tests. This study provides some evidence in support of negative density dependent effects in temperate forests.

PY  - 2011
AB  - La mortalidad de las plantulas es el resultado de una gama de procesos y agentes que pueden variar espacial y temporalmente en los ecosistemas forestales. En este estudio cuantificamos la emergencia y mortalidad de plantulas mes a mes, por un periodo de dos anos en un bosque situado en la zona de transicion entre la region mediterranea y templada de Chile. Pretendimos dilucidar si las especies sobreviven en forma diferencial a la disminucion estacional en la disponibilidad de agua, a la variacion espacial en la disponibilidad de luz y a la densidad local de plantulas. Las especies mas abundantes en el banco de plantulas son la esclerofila Cryptocarya alba (61%) y la especie templada Aextoxicon punctatum (29%). Del total de 504 plantulas emergidas durante el estudio, murieron 279, lo que corresponde a un 55,4 %. Cuatro de las especies menos abundantes (Persea lingue, Peumus boldus, Nothofagus obliqua y Luma apiculata) sufrieron un 100 % de mortalidad de plantulas emergidas durante los dos anos. La mortalidad de A.punctatum evidencio una marcada estacionalidad, con tasas elevadas durante la estacion mas seca (verano), pero este patron fue mucho menos evidente en C. alba. Un analisis de regresion multiple mostro que la luz no afecto la mortalidad de A. punctatum ni de C. alba. El mismo analisis demostro que existe un efecto densodependiente conespecifico sobre la mortalidad de A. punctatum, en contraste con C. alba, cuya mortalidad no fue afectada por la densidad conespecifica de plantulas. Efectos densodependientes comunitarios se descartan para ambas especies. La presente investigacion muestra que los factores criticos varian espacial y temporalmente determinando diferencias interespecificas en la supervivencia de plantulas de especies nativas en este tipo de ecosistema.

TI  - The strength of density-dependent mortality is contingent on climate and seedling size
PY  - 2018
AB  - QUESTIONS: Density‐dependent processes may promote species diversity in plant communities. Here, we tested whether seedling survival was density‐dependent and varied by seedling size, species and climatic factors. LOCATION: Tropical rain forest, Xishuangbanna, southwest China. METHODS: Generalized linear mixed‐effects models were used to examine seedling survival (232 tree species) across 9 years of seedling census data from a 20‐ha tropical forest dynamics plot. Our predictor variables were conspecific and heterospecific neighbour density, size of the seedling and annual variation in climatic factors. RESULTS: We found significant negative effects of conspecific tree density, but positive effects of heterospecific seedling density on the survival of tree seedlings in this plot. In general, conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) was observed most frequently for large size classes of seedlings (≥20‐cm high), while heterospecific positive density dependence (HPDD) was similar at all size classes. CNDD for large seedlings was stronger during warm years, and HPDD for large seedlings was stronger during dry years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the strength of density dependence varied through time, and this strength was influenced by water availability and temperature. Our results highlight the potential for changes in species composition and species co‐existence that could result from increasing temperature‐strengthening CNDD effects and decreasing precipitation strengthening HPDD effects.

TI  - Density dependence is not very prevalent in a heterogeneous subtropical forest
PY  - 2012
AB  - Th ere is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that tree survival is infl uenced by negative density-dependence, but it is still controversial how the eff ect may vary with life-stage, and to what extent it plays a role in regulating tree survival in heterogeneous subtropical forests. In this study, we investigated density-dependent eff ects on tree survival of six tree species in a 5-ha subtropical forest in eastern China. Th e roughly 45 000 individuals in the forest were fully censused in 2003 and 2008. For each of these species, we used an inhomogeneous pair-correlation function to quantify the change in spatial distribution for diff erent size classes, and a case-control design to study seedling–adult associations in 2003. Autologistic regression was used to determine the infl uence of neighborhood factors on individual survival from 2003 to 2008. We found that seedlings of fi ve species were repulsed by distance to nearest conspecifi c adults in terms of their survival, consistent with predictions of the Janzen – Connell mechanism. By contrast, only the least shade-tolerant Schima superba had a negative relationship with individual survival and conspecifi c distance-weighted basal area. Th is suggests that the Janzen – Connell eff ect is only prevalent at the early seedling stage or seed-to-seedling phase. Th e strength of clustering signifi cantly declined at sapling – pole and pole – adult transitions for Sycopsis sinensis and at seedling – sapling transition for Cleyera pachyphylla . Correlations between individual survival and conspecifi c abundance for these species were consistent with trends in the strength of clustering. Th ese results suggest that density dependence plays a limited role in individual survival and species spatial structure beyond the early seedling stage (i.e. after true leaves growing) in this forest. In addition, this study indicates that including individuals from early life-stages and factoring out potential confounding factors such as habitat preference are important in studies that seek evidence for density dependence in forest trees.

TI  - Persistence of Neighborhood Demographic Influences over Long Phylogenetic Distances May Help Drive Post-Speciation Adaptation in Tropical Forests
PY  - 2016
AB  - Studies of forest dynamics plots (FDPs) have revealed a variety of negative density-dependent (NDD) demographic interactions, especially among conspecific trees. These interactions can affect growth rate, recruitment and mortality, and they play a central role in the maintenance of species diversity in these complex ecosystems. Here we use an equal area annulus (EAA) point-pattern method to comprehensively analyze data from two tropical FDPs, Barro Colorado Island in Panama and Sinharaja in Sri Lanka. We show that these NDD interactions also influence the continued evolutionary diversification of even distantly related tree species in these FDPs. We examine the details of a wide range of these interactions between individual trees and the trees that surround them. All these interactions, and their cumulative effects, are strongest among conspecific focal and surrounding tree species in both FDPs. They diminish in magnitude with increasing phylogenetic distance between heterospecific focal and surrounding trees, but do not disappear or change the pattern of their dependence on size, density, frequency or physical distance even among the most distantly related trees. The phylogenetic persistence of all these effects provides evidence that interactions between tree species that share an ecosystem may continue to promote adaptive divergence even after the species’ gene pools have become separated. Adaptive divergence among taxa would operate in stark contrast to an alternative possibility that has previously been suggested, that distantly related species with dispersal-limited distributions and confronted with unpredictable neighbors will tend to converge on common strategies of resource use. In addition, we have also uncovered a positive density-dependent effect: growth rates of large trees are boosted in the presence of a smaller basal area of surrounding trees. We also show that many of the NDD interactions switch sign rapidly as focal trees grow in size, and that their cumulative effect can strongly influence the distributions and species composition of the trees that surround the focal trees during the focal trees’ lifetimes.

TI  - Are all seeds equal? Spatially explicit comparisons of seed fall and sapling recruitment in a tropical forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 195-201 ABSTRACT: Understanding demographic transitions may provide the key to explain the high diversity of tropical tree communities. In a faunally intact Amazonian forest, we compared the spatial distribution of saplings of 15 common tree species with patterns of conspecific seed fall, and examined the seed-to-sapling transition in relation to locations of conspecific trees. In all species, the spatial pattern of sapling recruitment bore no resemblance to predicted distributions based on the density of seed fall. Seed efficiency (the probability of a seed producing a sapling) is strongly correlated with distance from large conspecific trees, with a > 30-fold multiplicative increase between recruitment zones that are most distant vs. proximal to conspecific adults. The striking decoupling of sapling recruitment and conspecific seed density patterns indicates near-complete recruitment failure in areas of high seed density located around reproductive adults. Our results provide strong support for the spatially explicit predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

TI  - When Seed Dispersal Matters
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract A profusion of fruit forms implies that seed dispersal plays a central role in plant ecology, yet the chance that an individual seed will ultimately produce a reproductive adult is low to infinitesimal. Extremely high variance in survival implies that variations in fruit production or transitions from seed to seedling will contribute little to population growth. The key issue is that variance in survival of plant life-history stages, and therefore the importance of dispersal, differs greatly among and within plant communities. In stable communities of a few species of long-lived plants, variances in seed and seedling survival are immense, so seed-to-seedling transitions have little influence on overall population dynamics. However, when seedlings in different circumstances have very different chances of survival—in ecological succession, for example, or when dispersed seeds escape density-dependent mortality near parent trees—the biased survival of dispersed seeds or seedlings in some places rath...

TI  - Frequency‐dependent community dynamics driven by sexual interactions
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Research in community ecology has tended to focus on trophic interactions (e.g., predation, resource competition) as driving forces of community dynamics, and sexual interactions have often been overlooked. Here we discuss how sexual interactions can affect community dynamics, especially focusing on frequency‐dependent dynamics of horizontal communities (i.e., communities of competing species in a single ecological guild). By combining mechanistic and phenomenological models of competition, we place sexual reproduction into the framework of modern coexistence theory. First, we review how population dynamics of two species competing for two resources can be represented by the Lotka–Volterra competition model as well as frequency dynamics, and how niche differentiation and overlap produce negative and positive frequency‐dependence (i.e., stable coexistence and priority effect), respectively. Then, we explore two situations where sexual interactions change the frequency‐dependence in community dynamics: (1) reproductive interference, that is, negative interspecific interactions due to incomplete species recognition in mating trials, can promote positive frequency‐dependence and (2) density‐dependent intraspecific adaptation load, that is, reduced population growth rates due to adaptation to intraspecific sexual (or social) interactions, produces negative frequency‐dependence. We show how reproductive interference and density‐dependent intraspecific adaptation load can decrease and increase niche differences in the framework of modern coexistence theory, respectively. Finally, we discuss future empirical and theoretical approaches for studying how sexual interactions and related phenomena (e.g., reproductive interference, intraspecific adaptation load, and sexual dimorphism) driven by sexual selection and conflict can affect community dynamics.</jats:p>

TI  - Resolving the paradox of clumped seed dispersal: positive density and distance dependence in a bat-dispersed species
PY  - 2018
AB  - One of the hypothesized benefits of seed dispersal is to escape density- and distance-responsive, host-specific, natural enemies near maternal plants where conspecific seed and seedling densities are high. Such high conspecific neighbor densities typically result in lower offspring growth and survival (i.e., negative density-dependent effects), yet many dispersal modes result in clumped seed distributions. New World leaf-nosed bats transport fruits to their feeding roosts and deposit seeds, thereby creating high-density seed/seedling patches beneath feeding roosts in heterospecific trees away from maternal trees, which seemingly nullifies a key benefit of seed dispersal. Such dispersal may still be adaptive if negative density-dependent effects are reduced under feeding roosts or if the benefit of being dispersed away from maternal trees outweighs negative effects of conspecific seed/seedling density below roosts. We mapped the entire post-germination population of a bat-dispersed tree species Calophyllum longifolium (Calophyllaceae) in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama in each of three successive years. We tested two hypotheses: (1) distance-dependent effects are stronger than density-dependent effects on seedling performance because seedlings far from conspecific adults are more likely to escape natural enemies even when at high densities and (2) negative density-dependent effects will be reduced far from vs. near conspecific adults. Density and distance were naturally decoupled, as expected. However, in contrast to our expectation, we found positive density effects on seedling survival and density-dependent effects did not differ with distance from conspecific adults. Both density and distance had positive effects on seedling survival when considered together, while only year had a significant effect on seedling growth. Thus, both being dispersed under bat feeding roosts and escaping the vicinity of conspecific adults were beneficial for C. longifolium seedling survival, supporting the directed dispersal and escape hypotheses, respectively. Despite resulting in high densities of conspecific seedlings, favorable habitat under bat feeding roosts and lack of negative density-dependent effects appear to provide evolutionary advantages in C. longifolium.

TI  - Genetic evidence of frequent long-distance recruitment in a vertebrate-dispersed tree.
PY  - 2006
AB  - The importance of dispersal for the maintenance of biodiversity, while long-recognized, has remained unresolved. We used molecular markers to measure effective dispersal in a natural population of the vertebrate-dispersed Neotropical tree, Simarouba amara (Simaroubaceae) by comparing the distances between maternal parents and their offspring and comparing gene movement via seed and pollen in the 50 ha plot of the Barro Colorado Island forest, Central Panama. In all cases (parent-pair, mother-offspring, father-offspring, sib-sib) distances between related pairs were significantly greater than distances to nearest possible neighbours within each category. Long-distance seedling establishment was frequent: 74% of assigned seedlings established > 100 m from the maternal parent [mean = 392 +/- 234.6 m (SD), range = 9.3-1000.5 m] and pollen-mediated gene flow was comparable to that of seed [mean = 345.0 +/- 157.7 m (SD), range 57.6-739.7 m]. For S. amara we found approximately a 10-fold difference between distances estimated by inverse modelling and mean seedling recruitment distances (39 m vs. 392 m). Our findings have important implications for future studies in forest demography and regeneration, with most seedlings establishing at distances far exceeding those demonstrated by negative density-dependent effects.

TI  - Density-dependent Seed Predation and Plant Dispersion of the Tropical Palm Normanbya normanbyi'
PY  - 1995
AB  - We measured the response of seed predators to variation in seed density and distance between seed sources of palms in North Queensland, Australia. Adult palm trees occurred at a density of 20/ha. Their distribution was highly clumped and more than half the immature plants occurred within 3 m of an adult. Adult palms were also arranged in lines down the slope, apparently reflecting patterns of seed carriage by overland water flow. Seed dispersal is also affected by cassowaries, a ratite which ranges over many hundreds of ha and deposits seeds in dusters. Small mammals which range over a few ha may deposit seeds as single entities (singletons). Many seeds remain undispersed beneath the female parent with heavy predation. In this study seeds were placed beneath adult trees at two densities and were dispersed over varying distances as clusters of ten seeds and as singletons. Pigs and earwigs were the principal predators but they did not destroy all the seeds in any treatment. However, the germination percentage of the remaining seeds was greatly depressed indicating that one or both predators were disproportionately selecting potential germinants. Pigs were responsive to both density of seeds beneath a tree and the distance between seed sources; they did not damage dispersed seeds to a great extent. Earwigs also destroyed seeds more heavily beneath adult trees, but they were more efficient than pigs at locating dispersed seeds. Rodent predation was light and not responsive to seed density or dispersal.

TI  - Conspecific density dependence in seedlings varies with species shade tolerance in a wet tropical forest
PY  - 2011
AB  - Density-dependent seedling mortality could increase with a species relative abundance, thereby promoting species coexistence. Differences among species in light-dependent mortality also could enhance coexistence via resource partitioning. These compatible ideas rarely have been considered simultaneously. We developed models of mortality as functions of irradiance and local conspecific density (LCD) for seedlings of 53 tropical woody species. Species varied in mortality responses to these factors, but mortality consistently increased with shading and LCD. Across species, density-dependent mortality on a per-neighbour basis was inversely related to species community abundance, but higher LCD in more common species resulted in a weak relationship between species abundance and density-dependent mortality scaled to species maximum LCD. Species mortality responses to shading and maximum LCD were strongly and positively correlated. Our results suggest that species differences in density-dependent mortality are more strongly related to physiologically based life-history traits than biotic feedbacks related to community abundance.

TI  - Assessing the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on seedling survival in an African montane forest
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Tree seedling dynamics underpin subsequent forest structure and diversity as different species/guilds respond variously to abiotic and biotic stresses. Thus, understanding differential seedling responses to stresses helps us to predict forest trajectories. Because forests vary in both environment and species composition, generalisations across tropical forests are difficult. Afromontane forests are important carbon stores, harbour high diversity and provide critical ecosystem services, yet they are vulnerable to climate change. Here, we investigate the importance of key abiotic and biotic factors on survival of seedling guilds along spatial and temporal scales in a montane forest in south-eastern Nigeria. We use data from 318 seedling plots censused every 3 months from 2017 to 2020 to identify seven key abiotic and four biotic factors influencing seedling survival. We used the Kaplan–Meier method to estimate the persistence time of 1,145 seedlings at community and guild levels. At the community level, newly recruited seedlings had a median survival time of 15 months and about 37% of the seedlings sampled where still alive after 24 months. Understory tree species survived significantly longer than the other growth form guilds and seedling survival did not differ across shade tolerance guilds. Conspecific adult density and steeper, more north facing slopes had a negative effect on tree seedlings survival. In addition, tree seedlings that recruited in October (end of wet season/beginning of dry) had lower survival probabilities compared to those that recruited in the other months. Except for initial height, seedling survival in lianas was not impacted by any of the abiotic and biotic variables tested. Our results suggest that under the current environment forest structure and diversity is changing, most noticeably lianas are increasing in abundance relative to trees.</jats:p>

TI  - TOLERANCE OF SOIL PATHOGENS CO-VARIES WITH SHADE TOLERANCE ACROSS SPECIES OF TROPICAL TREE SEEDLINGS
PY  - 2008
AB  - A negative feedback between local abundance and natural enemies could contribute to maintaining tree species diversity by constraining population growth of common species. Soil pathogens could be an important mechanism of such noncompetitive distance and density-dependent (NCDD) mortality, but susceptibility to local pathogens may be ameliorated by a life history strategy that favors survivorship. In a shade-house experiment (1% full sun), we tested seedling life span, growth, and mass allocation responses to microbial extract filtered from conspecific-cultured soil in 21 tree species that varied in abundance and shade tolerance in a wet tropical forest (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica). Forty-three percent of the species had significant reductions, and 10% of the species had significant increases in life span, growth, root length, or root surface area when inoculated with microbial extract; 10% of the species experienced opposing reductions and increases in these characteristics. Contrary to expectation, species' local abundance was not related to species- specific responses to microbial extracts from cultured soils. Across species, seedling shade tolerance (survival at 1% full sun) was negatively correlated with susceptibility to the microbial treatment for both survival and total mass accumulation, thereby exaggerating shade tolerance differences among species. Thus, soil pathogens may contribute to species coexistence through heightening niche differentiation rather than through negative density dependence in common species.

TI  - Genetic tracking of density-dependent adult recruitment: A case study in a subtropical oak
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Density‐dependent recruitment is fundamental to understanding species diversity and community dynamics in plants. Although there is compelling evidence that seeds and seedlings die from conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) as predicted by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, characterising adult recruitment remains a challenge for long‐living trees. Previous studies have used the decrease in fine‐scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) across life stages to indicate CNDD; however, this has not been tested rigorously.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We addressed these challenges by integrating dispersal kernels and FSGS. To establish links between density dependence and FSGS, we simulated seedlings based on the estimated dispersal kernels from parentage analyses, and further simulated adults under various seedling‐to‐adult recruitment scenarios, using an individual‐based spatially explicit model. We tested this method in an isolated <jats:italic>Cyclobalanopsis glauca</jats:italic> population on China's Dajinshan Island.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We detected significant FSGS in the seedlings and weaker, though also significant, FSGS in the adults. As expected, the observed FSGS of seedlings was well predicted by the simulated seedlings, with observations falling inside the 95% confidence envelopes over all distance classes. However, the simulations showed that CNDD enhanced the FSGS while positive density dependence dampened it during the seedling‐to‐adult transition. The adult FSGS of our population was therefore explained by positive rather than negative density‐dependent adult recruitment.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our study demonstrates that the change of FSGS in conjunction with dispersal‐based model tests can offer a valuable insight into density‐dependent adult recruitment. The results indicate that the transitions from seedlings to adults in <jats:italic>C. glauca</jats:italic> are dominantly regulated not by Janzen–Connell effects, but by processes of positive density dependence. More broadly, the findings may provide a caution against extrapolations of widespread Janzen–Connell effects in seeds and seedlings to adult recruits, underscoring a critical gap between mechanisms at early stages and long‐term population and community dynamics.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - The escape hypothesis: a test involving a temperate, annual grass
PY  - 1987
AB  - The escape hypothesis predicts a greater probability of survival for seeds that are dispersed farther away from an isolated parent plant. This hypothesis was examined for Panicum miliaceum L., an annual grass that grows as an agrestal weed or as a crop. The patterns of seeds and mature offspring surrounding each of twenty parent plants were mapped. For those cases involving a large sample size, the average distance of the mature offspring from the parent plant was significantly (p <0.05) greater than the mean dispersal distance of the seeds. When the slope of the semi-log plot of seed density against dispersal distance was compared with the equivalent slope for mature offspring density, the former was found to be steeper (more negative) than the latter in seven of twenty cases. Again, these were the cases with the most completely described seed and mature offspring patterns. These results support the escape hypothesis. They were interpreted to be the result of density dependent mortality. The evidence in the literature against the escape hypothesis was found to be weak and sometimes irrelevant. The implications of density independent mortality in parent offspring relationships are discussed.

TI  - Phytochemical diversity impacts herbivory in a tropical rainforest tree community.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Metabolomics provides an unprecedented window into diverse plant secondary metabolites that represent a potentially critical niche dimension in tropical forests underlying species coexistence. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to evaluate chemical composition of 358 tree species and its relationship with phylogeny and variation in light environment, soil nutrients, and insect herbivore leaf damage in a tropical rainforest plot. We report no phylogenetic signal in most compound classes, indicating rapid diversification in tree metabolomes. We found that locally co-occurring species were more chemically dissimilar than random and that local chemical dispersion and metabolite diversity were associated with lower herbivory, especially that of specialist insect herbivores. Our results highlight the role of secondary metabolites in mediating plant-herbivore interactions and their potential to facilitate niche differentiation in a manner that contributes to species coexistence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that specialist herbivore pressure is an important mechanism promoting phytochemical diversity in tropical forests.

TI  - Defaunation increases the spatial clustering of lowland Western Amazonian tree communities
PY  - 2018
AB  - Declines of large vertebrates in tropical forests may reduce dispersal of tree species that rely on them, and the resulting undispersed seedlings might suffer increased distance‐ and density‐dependent mortality. Consequently, extirpation of large vertebrates may alter the composition and spatial structure of plant communities and impair ecosystem functions like carbon storage. We analysed spatial patterns of tree recruitment within six forest plots along a defaunation gradient in western Amazonia. We divided recruits into two size cohorts (“saplings”: ≥1 m tall and <1 cm diameter at breast height [dbh], and juveniles, 1–2 cm dbh) and examined the spatial organisation of conspecific recruits within each cohort (within‐cohort) and around conspecific reproductive‐sized trees (between‐cohort). We used replicated spatial point pattern analysis to quantify relationships between recruit clustering and cohort, defaunation intensity, each tree species reliance on hunted dispersers and the interactions among these three covariates. Within‐cohort clustering of conspecific saplings increased with reliance of tree species on hunted dispersers, and this trend strengthened significantly as defaunation increased, probably because of reduced dispersal. Within‐cohort clustering of conspecifics declined from saplings to juveniles, suggesting density‐dependent mortality of saplings. However, the positive relationship between sapling clustering and defaunation did not lead to greater reductions in within‐cohort clustering during the sapling–juvenile transition, suggesting that higher conspecific densities did not translate into increased mortality. Instead, the increased spatial clustering associated with defaunation was retained for juvenile recruits. Between‐cohort clustering was unrelated to defaunation and did not change during the sapling–juvenile transition. Synthesis. Defaunation increased spatial aggregation of saplings of tree species reliant on hunted dispersers. The increase in sapling clustering did not increase density‐dependent thinning, and persisted into older recruit cohorts, suggesting that hunting may initiate long‐term spatial reorganisation of Amazonian tree communities. The lack of increased density‐dependent thinning indicates that reduced dispersal did not increase mortality of large‐vertebrate dispersed tree species that contribute disproportionately to forest biomass. We, therefore, caution against the fait accompli acceptance of the prediction by recent modelling studies that overhunting will precipitate a collapse in carbon sequestration by tropical forests.

TI  - Janzen-Connell effects in a forest BEF experiment: Strong distance-dependent seedling establishment of multiple species.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis is a major ecological explanation for high species richness, in particular in tropical forest ecosystems. Central components of the JC hypothesis are noncompetitive effects of distance and density dependence, two drivers that contribute independently to species coexistence, but are ultimately linked in the field. However, although numerous studies provide evidence for either distance- or density-dependent effects based on observational data, experimental testing of simultaneous and interactive effects of distance and density has rarely been conducted, especially in a comprehensive multispecies approach. Here, we make use of the forest Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning project (BEF) -China to estimate distance- and density-dependent effects in a reciprocal tree seedling transplant experiment of 11 tree species. We deployed 13,490 juveniles of all 11 species in their own (home) and in all foreign monocultures (away), as well as at three different levels of planting density, thereby testing for distance and density effects, respectively. In addition, to quantify the amount to which density effects were brought about by potential additional effects of intraspecific competition, we set up a common garden experiment with different levels of planting density, where an additional "shadow" treatment controlled for effects of canopy shading. Although the "away" and "high-density" treatments significantly impaired the performance and productivity of seedlings, leaf damage and survival was exclusively affected by either the home/away or the density treatment, respectively. Negative density-dependent effects on leaf damage were less pronounced in the "home" treatment, showing that the effects were not additive. In addition, results obtained in the Common Garden Experiment showed that negative effects of high density may be also brought about by intraspecific competition as an alternative density-responsive mechanism and less by true JC effects. Overall, our results provide strong support on a multispecies basis for the influence of host-specific effects already operating in early stages of a forest plantation. However, they also emphasize the need to account appropriately for potential additional density-responsive mechanisms such as intraspecific competition or microenvironmental conditions when addressing the role of JC effects for species coexistence.

TI  - Are ecologists blind to small things? The missed stories on non-tropical seed predation on feces.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Seed dispersal involves several complex stages that can be affected by multiple peripheral processes. Thus, a major dispersal event can be followed by secondary dispersal, which can reduce density-dependent mortality and consolidate the dispersal phase. But predation events can also follow, and predation of seeds in feces is particularly interesting because it can heavily alter the fate of seeds dispersed through vertebrate guts. Our review of 20 cases involving this kind of interaction found that research has chiefly been in tropical and subtropical areas (85% of cases), suggesting that it is a minor phenomenon at higher latitudes. However, the small size of both the seeds and predators involved may have caused this process to go unnoticed outside the tropics. We tested the presence of predation of seeds in feces at a temperate, semi-arid and small-seed dominated ecosystem and found that it can be as important as in tropical latitudes, affecting up to 80% of feces in mid-summer. Moreover, it may influence endozoochory in a way whose significance could have been strongly underestimated, as it affects 35% of the seeds dispersed by sheep during the year. Our results may encourage scientists to pay attention to other interactions that may be widespread globally but go unnoticed. The study of seed dispersal, especially, may be suffering from the researchers’ difficulty in handling processes that are difficult to observe because of the small size of the organisms involved.

TI  - Does relatedness matter? : phylogenetic density-dependent survival of seedlings in a tropical forest
PY  - 2014
AB  - A complex set of interactions among neighbors influences plant performance and community structure. Understanding their joint operation requires extensive information on species characteristics and individual performance. We evaluated first-year survival of 35 719 tropical forest seedlings of 222 species and 15 annual cohorts relative to the density of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors and the phylogenetic similarity of heterospecific neighbors. Neighbors were from two size classes, and size asymmetric interactions provided insight into likely mechanisms. Large heterospecific and conspecific neighbors reduced seedling survival equally, suggesting resource competition rather than host-specific enemies as a mechanism. In contrast, much stronger negative conspecific effects were associated with seedling neighbors capable of limited resource uptake, suggesting shared pests rather than competition as the mechanism. Survival improved, however, near phylogenetically similar heterospecific neighbors, sugge...

TI  - Interspecific variation in conspecific negative density dependence can make species less likely to coexist.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is thought to promote plant species diversity. Theoretical studies showing the importance of CNDD often assumed that all species are equally susceptible to CNDD; however, recent empirical studies have shown species can differ greatly in their susceptibility to CNDD. Using a theoretical model, we show that interspecific variation in CNDD can dramatically alter its impact on diversity. First, if the most common species are the least regulated by CNDD, then the stabilising benefit of CNDD is reduced. Second, when seed dispersal is limited, seedlings that are susceptible to CNDD are at a competitive disadvantage. When parameterised with estimates of CNDD from a tropical tree community in Panama, our model suggests that the competitive inequalities caused by interspecific variation in CNDD may undermine many species' ability to persist. Thus, our model suggests that variable CNDD may make communities less stable, rather than more stable.

TI  - Large-area imaging reveals biologically driven non-random spatial patterns of corals at a remote reef
PY  - 2017
AB  - For sessile organisms such as reef-building corals, differences in the degree of dispersion of individuals across a landscape may result from important differences in life-history strategies or may reflect patterns of habitat availability. Descriptions of spatial patterns can thus be useful not only for the identification of key biological and physical mechanisms structuring an ecosystem, but also by providing the data necessary to generate and test ecological theory. Here, we used an in situ imaging technique to create large-area photomosaics of 16 plots at Palmyra Atoll, central Pacific, each covering 100 m2 of benthic habitat. We mapped the location of 44,008 coral colonies and identified each to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Using metrics of spatial dispersion, we tested for departures from spatial randomness. We also used targeted model fitting to explore candidate processes leading to differences in spatial patterns among taxa. Most taxa were clustered and the degree of clustering varied by taxon. A small number of taxa did not significantly depart from randomness and none revealed evidence of spatial uniformity. Importantly, taxa that readily fragment or tolerate stress through partial mortality were more clustered. With little exception, clustering patterns were consistent with models of fragmentation and dispersal limitation. In some taxa, dispersion was linearly related to abundance, suggesting density dependence of spatial patterning. The spatial patterns of stony corals are non-random and reflect fundamental life-history characteristics of the taxa, suggesting that the reef landscape may, in many cases, have important elements of spatial predictability.

TI  - Interannual climate variability has predominant effects on seedling survival in a temperate forest.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and niche partitioning have been proposed to explain species coexistence and community diversity. However, as a potentially important axis of niche partitioning, the role of interannual climate variability in driving local community dynamics remains largely unknown. Here we used a 15-year monitoring data set of more than 53,000 seedlings in a temperate forest to examine (1) what are the relative effects of interannual climate variability, biotic interactions, and habitat conditions on seedling survival; (2) how the effects of biotic interactions change with interannual climate variability, and habitat conditions; and (3) whether the impacts of interannual climate variability, biotic interactions, and habitat conditions differ with plant traits. Interannual climate variability accounted for the most variation in seedling survival at the community level, followed by biotic interactions, and habitat conditions. Increased snowpack and decreased minimum temperature during the non-growing season had positive effects on seedling survival. Effects of conspecific neighbor density were weakened in higher snowpack, effective accumulated temperature, elevation, and soil-resource gradient, but were intensified with increased ultraviolet radiation, maximum precipitation, minimum temperature, and soil moisture. In addition, the relative importance of interannual climate variability versus biotic interactions differed depending on species-trait groups. Specifically, biotic interactions for gravity-dispersed species had a larger effect size in affecting seedling survival than other trait groups. Also, gravity-dispersed species experienced a stronger CNDD than wind-dispersed, probably because wind-dispersed seedlings rarely had adult conspecifics nearby. We found that interannual climate variability was most strongly associated with seedling survival, but the magnitude of climatic effects varied among species-trait groups. Interannual climate variability may act as an inhibitor or accelerator to density-dependent interactions and should be accounted for in future studies, as both a potential direct and indirect factor in understanding the diversity of forest communities.

TI  - Tree species diversity increases with conspecific negative density dependence across an elevation gradient.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Elevational and latitudinal gradients in species diversity may be mediated by biotic interactions that cause density-dependent effects of conspecifics on survival or growth to differ from effects of heterospecifics (i.e. conspecific density dependence), but limited evidence exists to support this. We tested the hypothesis that conspecific density dependence varies with elevation using over 40 years of data on tree survival and growth from 23 old-growth temperate forest stands across a 1,000-m elevation gradient. We found that conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival of small-to-intermediate-sized focal trees were negative in lower elevation, higher diversity forest stands typically characterised by warmer temperatures and greater relative humidity. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on survival were less negative in higher elevation stands and ridges than in lower elevation stands and valley bottoms for small-to-intermediate-sized trees, but were neutral for larger trees across elevations. Conspecific-density-dependent effects on growth were negative across all tree size classes and elevations. These findings reveal fundamental differences in biotic interactions that may contribute to relationships between species diversity, elevation and climate.

TI  - Neutral communities may lead to decreasing diversity-disturbance relationships: insights from a generic simulation model
PY  - 2011
AB  - Many attempts have been made to confirm or reject the unimodal relationship between disturbance and diversity stated by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). However, the reasons why the predictions of the IDH apply or fail in particular systems are not always obvious. Here, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based community model that simulates species coexistence in a landscape subjected to disturbances to compare diversity-disturbance curves of communities with different coexistence mechanisms: neutrality, trade-off mechanism and intraspecific density dependence. We show that the shape of diversity-disturbance curves differs considerably depending on the type of coexistence mechanism assumed: (1) Neutral communities generally show decreasing diversity-disturbance curves with maximum diversity at zero disturbance rates contradicting the IDH, whereas trade-off communities generally show unimodal relationships confirming the IDH and (2) density-dependent mechanisms do increase the diversity of both neutral and trade-off communities. Finally, we discuss how these mechanisms determine diversity in disturbed landscapes.

TI  - Individual Species-Area Relationship of Woody Plant Communities in a Heterogeneous Subtropical Monsoon Rainforest
PY  - 2015
AB  - The spatial structure of species richness is often characterized by the species-area relationship (SAR). However, the SAR approach rarely considers the spatial variability of individual plants that arises from species interactions and species' habitat associations. Here, we explored how the interactions of individual plants of target species influence SAR patterns at a range of neighborhood distances. We analyzed the data of 113,988 woody plants of 110 species from the Fushan Forest Dynamics Plot (25 ha), northern Taiwan, which is a subtropical rainforest heavily influenced by typhoons. We classified 34 dominant species into 3 species types (i.e., accumulator, repeller, or no effect) by testing how the individual species-area relationship (i.e., statistics describing how neighborhood species richness changes around individuals) of target species departs (i.e., positively, negatively, or with no obvious trend) from a null model that accounts for habitat association. Deviation from the null model suggests that the net effect of species' interactions increases (accumulate) or decreases (repel) neighborhood species richness. We found that (i) accumulators were dominant at small interaction distances ( 30 m); (iii) repellers were rarely detected; and (iv) large-sized and abundant species tended to be accumulators. The findings suggest that positive species interactions have the potential to accumulate neighborhood species richness, particularly through size- and density-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesized that the frequently disturbed environment of this subtropical rainforest (e.g., typhoon-driven natural disturbances such as landslides, soil erosion, flooding, and windthrow) might create the spatial heterogeneity of species richness and promote positive species interactions.

TI  - Empirical evaluation of directed dispersal and density-dependent effects across successive recruitment phases
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. The directed-dispersal (DrD) hypothesis constitutes one of the main explanations for the adaptive value of seed dispersal in spatially heterogeneous environments. Traditionally, the DrD hypothesis asserts non-random arrival to specific sites where establishment conditions are independently favourable. Yet, enhanced arrival might negatively affect the establishment in otherwise favourable sites through enhanced density-dependent mortality (DDM). Since both density effects and habitat suitability might differ among establishment phases, assessment of habitat suitability should encompass the entire establishment process. 2. Here, we test the DrD hypothesis against a null model of random dispersal (RD) in an arid ecosystem where fleshy-fruited perennial Ochradenus baccatus shrubs are dispersed by two resident passerines. Acacia trees were predicted to present the favourable habitat in our system through the nurse-plant effect facilitating O. baccatus early establishment. 3. We determined expected seed arrival by monitoring the dispersers’ time allocation among the different habitats and assessed habitat quality for different establishment phases: seed-phase survival (post-dispersal survival and germination) was determined by line transects, while early seedling survival was estimated by monitoring seedlings throughout the first dry season. Additionally, subsequent recruitment success was assessed by comparing the distribution of adult shrubs to that expected from the observed germination patterns. 4. When considering the expected seed arrival and early establishment (seed-phase and early seedling survival), the DrD hypothesis is supported: birds preferentially deposited seeds in habitats where conditions are favourable (e.g. under Acacia trees). Yet, considering recruitment success during later phases, the dispersal service provided by the birds was less beneficial than RD. 5. Effective density was indexed using the zone-of-influence approach in which densities are corrected by phase-specific sizes. We suggest that intense seed deposition into favourable habitats has led to strong DDM (presumably through competition) in those habitats during late establishment phases and was responsible, at least partially, for changes in habitat suitability across the recruitment phases. 6. Synthesis. Our results show that assessment of the DrD hypothesis depends on the context of the study (in terms of recruitment phases) since sites of enhanced seed arrival and high seed-to-seedling survival can ultimately prove unfavourable to the plant if density-dependent or other effects might increase mortality in these sites during later recruitment phases.

TI  - Differential soil fungus accumulation and density dependence of trees in a subtropical forest
PY  - 2019
AB  - The mechanisms underlying interspecific variation in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) are poorly understood. Using a multilevel modeling approach, we combined long-term seedling demographic data from a subtropical forest plot with soil fungal community data by means of DNA sequencing to address the feedback of various guilds of soil fungi on the density dependence of trees. We show that mycorrhizal type mediates tree neighborhood interactions at the community level, and much of the interspecific variation in CNDD is explained by how tree species differ in their fungal density accumulation rates as they grow. Species with higher accumulation rates of pathogenic fungi suffered more from CNDD, whereas species with lower CNDD had higher accumulation rates of ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that mutualistic and pathogenic fungi play important but opposing roles.

TI  - Conspecific negative density-dependent mortality and the structure of temperate forests
PY  - 2014
AB  - Factors that control tree seedling dynamics are critical determinants of forest diversity. We examined the role of density-dependent mortality and abiotic factors in the differential establishment and survival of tree seedlings at three, large, mapped forest plots in Indiana, Virginia, and Wisconsin, USA. We tested whether seedling densities and seedling survival are related to local biotic and abiotic factors with generalized linear mixed models. Spatial point pattern analyses were utilized to determine if the distribution patterns of seedlings and saplings are consistent with a pattern generated by negative density-dependent mortality with respect to conspecific trees.

Initial sampled seedling density for nearly a third of species showed a positive correlation with increasing conspecific basal area, indicating dispersal limitation, but few had any association with abiotic variables. By contrast, survival of seedlings over one year significantly declined with increasing conspecific basal area. Point pattern analyses indicated that nearly one-third of tree species had significantly over-dispersed point patterns of conspecific seedlings and saplings relative to adult densities; the majority of other species exhibited random spatial arrangements. Our results demonstrate that negative conspecific density-dependent mortality of seedlings could generate the spatial patterns observed at later life stages. By differentially favoring seedlings of other species, this process may contribute to the maintenance of tree diversity in temperate forests, just as others have demonstrated for tropical forests.

TI  - Spatial distribution and interspecific associations in a deciduous broad‐leaved forest in north‐central China
PY  - 2019
AB  - QUESTIONS: What are the primary types of intraspecific distribution patterns and interspecific associations of tree species in the temperate–subtropical transition region? Can potential ecological mechanisms such as habitat heterogeneity, dispersal limitation, density dependence, spatial segregation, and competition between species regulate these patterns? LOCATION: The Qinling Mountains, north‐central China. METHODS: Ripley's K‐function, D‐function and pair correlation function were applied to assess the spatial distribution of 15 dominant tree species in a fully mapped 25‐ha plot. Complete spatial randomness (CSR), heterogeneous Poisson (HP) and random‐labelling (RL) null models were used to reveal the potential process of community construction. RESULTS: (a) Thirteen of 15 adult tree species displayed an aggregation distribution at various scales. (b) Eleven adult species (73.3%) showed significant aggregation, especially at small distances, after removing the effect of habitat. (c) The percentage of species showing additional aggregation relative to adults decreased from saplings to juveniles. The maximum strength of density dependence was negative with species abundance. (d) Only 29 (13.8%) of the species pairs showed significant small‐scale interactions. Most of the significant small‐scale associations did not occur in abundant species pairs. (e) Negative interactions of interspecific associations were more prevalent than positive ones, yet there was no consistency of the characteristics among species pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Habitat heterogeneity and dispersal limitation likely contribute to the spatial pattern of tree species at different life stages. Density dependence remains the important factor in maintaining species diversity in this forest stand. Moreover, spatial segregation generates the interspecific spatial patterns of segregation and partial overlap. Unexpectedly, the species herd protection hypothesis and the low‐frequency hypothesis cannot well explain the mechanism of interspecific interaction at small distances. Resource competition might be responsible for negative associations being more frequent among species pairs.

TI  - Density-dependent adult recruitment in a low-density tropical tree
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis is a well-known explanation for why tropical forests have large numbers of tree species. A fundamental prediction of the hypothesis is that the probability of adult recruitment is less in regions of high conspecific adult density, a pattern mediated by density-dependent mortality in juvenile life stages. Although there is strong evidence in many tree species that seeds, seedlings, and saplings suffer conspecific density-dependent mortality, no study has shown that adult tree recruitment is negatively density dependent. Density-dependent adult recruitment is necessary for the Janzen-Connell mechanism to regulate tree populations. Here, we report density-dependent adult recruitment in the population of Handroanthus guayacan, a wind-dispersed Neotropical canopy tree species. We use data from high-resolution remote sensing to track individual trees with proven capacity to flower in a lowland moist forest landscape in Panama and analyze these data in a Bayesian framework similar to capture-recapture analysis. We independently quantify probabilities of adult tree recruitment and detection and show that adult recruitment is negatively density dependent. The annualized probability of adult recruitment was 3.03% ⋅ year-1 Despite the detection of negative density dependence in adult recruitment, it was insufficient to stabilize the adult population of H. guayacan, which increased significantly in size over the decade of observation.

TI  - Low host specificity and abundance of frugivorous lepidoptera in the lowland rain forests of Papua New Guinea.
PY  - 2017
AB  - We studied a community of frugivorous Lepidoptera in the lowland rainforest of Papua New Guinea. Rearing revealed 122 species represented by 1,720 individuals from 326 woody plant species. Only fruits from 52% (171) of the plant species sampled were attacked. On average, Lepidoptera were reared from 1 in 89 fruits and a kilogram of fruit was attacked by 1.01 individuals. Host specificity of Lepidoptera was notably low: 69% (33) of species attacked plants from >1 family, 8% (4) fed on single family, 6% (3) on single genus and 17% (8) were monophagous. The average kilogram of fruits was infested by 0.81 individual from generalist species (defined here as feeding on >1 plant genus) and 0.07 individual from specialist species (feeding on a single host or congeneric hosts). Lepidoptera preferred smaller fruits with both smaller mesocarp and seeds. Large-seeded fruits with thin mesocarp tended to host specialist species whereas those with thick, fleshy mesocarp were often infested with both specialist and generalist species. The very low incidence of seed damage suggests that pre-dispersal seed predation by Lepidoptera does not play a major role in regulating plant populations via density-dependent mortality processes outlined by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

TI  - Relating the Strength of Density Dependence and the Spatial Distribution of Individuals
PY  - 2021
AB  - Spatial patterns in ecology contain useful information about underlying mechanisms and processes. Although there are many summary statistics used to quantify these spatial patterns, there are far fewer models that directly link explicit ecological mechanisms to observed patterns easily derived from available data. We present a model of intraspecific spatial aggregation that quantitatively relates static spatial patterning to negative density dependence. Individuals are placed according to the colonization rule consistent with the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE), and die with probability proportional to their abundance raised to a power α, a parameter indicating the degree of density dependence. This model can therefore be interpreted as a hybridization of MaxEnt and mechanism. Our model shows quantitatively and generally that increasing density dependence randomizes spatial patterning. α = 1 recovers the strongly aggregated METE distribution that is consistent with many ecosystems empirically, and as α → 2 our prediction approaches the binomial distribution consistent with random placement. For 1 < α < 2, our model predicts more aggregation than random placement but less than METE. We additionally relate our mechanistic parameter α to the statistical aggregation parameter k in the negative binomial distribution, giving it an ecological interpretation in the context of density dependence. We use our model to analyze two contrasting datasets, a 50 ha tropical forest and a 64 m2 serpentine grassland plot. For each dataset, we infer α for individual species as well as a community α parameter. We find that α is generally larger in the tightly packed forest than the sparse grassland, and the degree of density dependence increases at smaller scales. These results are consistent with current understanding in both ecosystems, and we infer this underlying density dependence using only empirical spatial patterns. Our model can easily be applied to other datasets where spatially explicit data are available.

TI  - Seed dispersal kernels estimated from genotypes of established seedlings: does density‐dependent mortality matter?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary




The seed dispersal kernel is a major determinant of spatial population dynamics and spatial distribution of genetic diversity. Among the main methods to estimate it, inverse modelling (IM) and gene shadow model (GSM) rely on seed counts in traps, whereas competing source model (CSM) and spatially explicit mating models (SEMMs) rely on compositions of seed pools. Moreover, GSM, CSM and SEMM exploit genetic information from molecular markers, whereas IM only exploits seed counts ignoring seed origins. These methods were also applied to established seedlings.




In the presence of post-dispersal density-dependent mortality (DDM), the effective dispersal kernel, describing the spatial distribution of established seedlings relatively to the seed source, is notoriously different from the basic dispersal kernel, describing the spatial distribution of seed deposition sites relatively to the source. Using simulated data sets, we investigated whether IM, GSM, CSM and SEMM applied to established seedlings estimate the basic or the effective dispersal kernel. In our simulations, DDM resulted in a shift of the mean basic dispersal distance (10 m) towards substantially higher effective mean dispersal distances (15 m and 20·8 m).




We demonstrated that CSM and SEMM estimate the basic seed dispersal kernel, independently from the presence of post-dispersal mortality. By contrast, GSM estimates the effective dispersal kernel. IM failed to provide satisfactory estimates in the presence of DDM in our sampling design. Besides, for all methods, seed migration was inflated in the presence of DDM, due to lower mortality among randomly distributed immigrants relatively to local seedlings.




It could seem intuitive that estimates based on seedlings or seeds provide effective or basic dispersal kernels respectively. Our results showed that it is not true for estimates obtained with CSM or SEMM because they rely on the composition of seed/seedling pools and not seed/seedling counts such as IM or GSM. This has important consequences for life stage studies where the discordance of dispersal kernels estimated from different cohorts is used to investigate post-dispersal density-dependent mortality.

TI  - Crop size influences pre-dispersal seed predation in the Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2017
AB  - ABSTRACT Many pre-dispersal seed predators are specialized insects that rely on seeds for larval development. These insects may respond to the amount of seeds produced by a plant (i.e. crop size), increasing the proportion of seeds damaged with increases in seed numbers. Large seeds have more resources and spend more time in plants to complete their development and are probably more prone to be preyed on by those insects than small seeds. Here I tested how crop size and seed mass influence pre-dispersal seed predation in plants from the Cerrado savannas of Brazil. I related plant crop size to pre-dispersal seed predation for Xylopia aromatica and Erythroxylum pelleterianum. A literature review was performed to test if seed mass may explain among-species differences in pre-dispersal seed predation. Pre-dispersal losses increased proportionally to crop size in the two species investigated, but some species show positive or no density-dependent seed predation in literature, indicating that seed losses are not a simple function of crop sizes. Seed mass did not explain pre-dispersal seed loss differences among 14 species with data available. Pre-dispersal losses are often small and probably less important than seed dispersal and establishment limitation for plant recruitment in Cerrado savannas.

TI  - Spatial patterns of sapling mortality in a moist tropical forest: consistency with total density-dependent effects
PY  - 2015
AB  - Density-dependent mortality (DDM) is major driver of species coexistence in tropical forests. We assessed the occurrence and strength of this mechanism among saplings (i.e. trees with a diameter of 1–4 cm) in the moist tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, over six inter-census periods (26 years), by using spatial point pattern analysis. We considered conspecific density-dependent mortality, but also total DDM (i.e. the effects of conspecific and heterospecific neighbours all together) upon saplings of all species (i.e. at the community level), and on saplings of light-demanding and shade-tolerant ones, separately (i.e. at the light-guild level). We also analysed the effects of conspecific DDM at the community and light-guild levels. Conspecific density-dependent mortality affected a lower proportion of species than was to be expected. Its strength was not significantly related with species abundance, and it had relatively weak effects at the community and light guild levels. Conversely, we detected a significant spatial signature of total DDM among all saplings, and among saplings of the light-demanding and shade-tolerant species, but its strength showed pronounced temporal variation. Total DDM among light-demanding saplings was stronger than among shade-tolerant ones and its effects were particularly marked 10–15 years after the occurrence of unusually severe droughts associated with El Nino events. Our study indicates that conspecific DDM is relatively unimportant among saplings in comparison with total DDM at community and light-guild levels. This finding contrasts strongly with the results for seedlings, where conspecific DDM was constituted the dominant process. The pronounced temporal variations observed in the occurrence and strength of total DDM among saplings indicate that time-varying events associated with climatic disturbances such as canopy openings or episodes of high recruit emergence might be important drivers of this process. They also emphasize the importance of considering time frames longer than one decade to study density-dependent effects among saplings in tropical forests.

TI  - Substrate composition and adult distribution determine recruitment patterns in a Caribbean brooding coral
PY  - 2005
AB  - This study demonstrates the interactive effect of both substrate composition and adult presence on recruitment and mortality patterns of the earliest life stages in the coral Siderastrea radi- ans in the Florida Keys. Low substrate complexity on a wreck (the 'Benwood') facilitated the location and identification of recently settled coral recruits (<1 mm 2 ). Increased adult cover and changes in substrate composition (mainly the presence of crustose coralline algae) enhanced local recruitment, indicating that positive changes in substrate composition acted as an important factor enhancing coral recruitment. Spatial differences in the number of arriving recruits dictated future patterns in local population density as mortality probabilities did not vary spatially. S. radians populations showed the potential to be regulated in a density-dependent manner as suitable settlement substrate was, or could become, limited by (1) its natural availability or (2) preemption by growing adults. Adult removal resulted in a 46% decrease in local (<1 m 2 ) recruitment, indicating that S. radians popula- tions were facultatively closed at this spatial scale. Therefore, the S. radians/Benwood system allows for a detailed description of the processes that create structure in coral populations. Defining the rel- ative contribution of processes that are important in shaping coral population structure contrasts with the more common approach in which only the pattern that results from them is quantified. A process- based approach will allow for a more rigorous investigation of coral population dynamics with obvi- ous benefits for coral reef science and conservation.

TI  - Spatial patterns of tropical forest trees in Western Polynesia suggest recruitment limitations during secondary succession
PY  - 2007
AB  - Spatial analysis can be used to relate the patterns of tree species to their regeneration syndromes – pioneer to late-successional – and is a first step in refining hypotheses about the species traits and biotic and abiotic factors that give rise to forest community dynamics. This study examines the spatial pattern of the most abundant trees in three 0.45-ha plots in species-poor lowland rain forests on oceanic islands in Tonga, Western Polynesia, that experience frequent natural disturbance and have a 3000-y history of shifting cultivation. We contrast secondary vs. remnant late-successional forest, with particular attention paid to the spatial dispersion and clustering of tree species, and the presence of spatial dependence in the density of seedlings and saplings. Shade-tolerant species were not strongly clustered at any scale. They did not appear to be dispersal limited, in late successional forest, and only some showed patterns consistent with density-dependent mortality (more clumped when small). Shade-tolerant species were more clumped in secondary forest, and may be dispersal-limited there because vertebrate dispersers prefer primary forest. Shade-intolerant species were clumped in gaps in late-successional forest, but some were also clumped in secondary forest, indicating that they too may be dispersal limited during secondary succession. We also compared the species composition of seedlings and saplings in the centre of plots with trees in the surrounding area and inferred that active dispersal (by vertebrate frugivores) contributed as much as 50% to site species richness.

TI  - Approaches for testing herbivore effects on plant population dynamics
PY  - 2006
AB  - Summary


1
As plant invasions pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, it is critical to improve both our understanding of invasiveness and strategies for control. Much research into plant invasions and their management, including biological control, assumes strong demographic effects by natural enemies, including herbivores. However, the importance of natural enemies in the regulation of plant populations remains controversial: some ecologists contend that they rarely affect plant populations, and others that they can strongly limit plant population sizes.

2
We briefly review the conflicting views and suggest that new approaches to gather and analyse data are needed before the effects of natural enemies on plant populations can be fully characterized.

3
We outline experimental and analytical approaches that incorporate density dependence into population models and thus provide a more complete test of the long-term effects of natural enemies on plant populations. We also introduce new methods for obtaining stochastic estimates of equilibrium density, which will provide a key test of enemy effects on plant population size.

4
Synthesis and applications. Designing effective strategies for invasive plant management requires information about the factors that limit plant population size. Together, the experiments and analyses we describe measure more clearly how natural enemies influence plant population dynamics. They will provide an important tool in evaluating the role of enemy release in plant invasions and for predicting the potential success of biological control. Such information should help to prioritize strategies that are most likely to control invasive plants effectively and will contribute to risk assessment when considering the release of non-native natural enemies as biological control agents.

TI  - Guild-specific patterns of species richness and host specialization in plant–herbivore food webs from a tropical forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - 1.The extent to which plant-herbivore feeding interactions are specialized is key to understand the processes maintaining the diversity of both tropical forest plants and their insect herbivores. However, studies documenting the full complexity of tropical plant-herbivore food webs are lacking. 2. We describe a complex, species-rich plant-herbivore food web for lowland rain forest in Papua New Guinea, resolving 6818 feeding links between 224 plant species and 1490 herbivore species drawn from 11 distinct feeding guilds. By standardizing sampling intensity and the phylogenetic diversity of focal plants, we are able to make the first rigorous and unbiased comparisons of specificity patterns across feeding guilds. 3.Specificity was highly variable among guilds, spanning almost the full range of theoretically possible values from extreme trophic generalization to monophagy. 4.We identify guilds of herbivores that are most likely to influence the composition of tropical forest vegetation through density-dependent herbivory or apparent competition. 5.We calculate that 251 herbivore species (48 of them unique) are associated with each rain forest tree species in our study site so that the 200 tree species coexisting in the lowland rain forest community are involved in 50 000 trophic interactions with 9600 herbivore species of insects. This is the first estimate of total herbivore and interaction number in a rain forest plant?herbivore food web. 6. A comprehensive classification of insect herbivores into 24 guilds is proposed, providing a framework for comparative analyses across ecosystems and geographical regions.

TI  - Regeneration patterns of Cedrela lilloi (Meliaceae) in northwestern Argentina subtropical montane forests
PY  - 2000
AB  - All individuals of Cedrela lilloi (a valuable timber species of Meliaceae) > 4 cm DBH were sampled in three rectangular plots (c. 15 000 m 2 each) in northwestern Argentina subtropical montane forests between 850 and 1350 m. Regeneration dynamics of C. lilloi was characterized by testing two hypo- theses: (i) C. lilloi has a gap-phase regeneration mode, which implies a negative exponential size/age distribution at forest stand scale, growth releases due to canopy openings, and juvenile trees clumped at spatial scales of treefall gaps. (ii) There is a negative spatial association between adults and juveniles of C. lilloi which could be caused by density dependent mortality. Despite differences in age structure, diameter distribution approximated a negative exponential curve at all sites. Radial growth, measured as tree-ring widths, averaged between 2 and 4 mm y -1 which is comparable to fast growing tropical species in mature forests. Aggregation of juveniles peaked at radial distances of 8 to 15 m. Size structure, growth and spatial patterns of juveniles support the first hypothesis. In support of the second hypothesis, juveniles showed a negative spatial association with conspe- cific mature trees at spatial scales of less than 20 m. The Janzen-Connell model of density-dependence is one potential explanation for this pattern. Although regeneration and growth patterns of C. lilloi suggest a potential for sustainable management based on small-scale gaps, spatial dynamics at stand-scale need to be considered to ensure the regeneration of mature trees.

TI  - Strict mast fruiting for a tropical dipterocarp tree: a demographic cost–benefit analysis of delayed reproduction and seed predation
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Masting, the production of large seed crops at intervals of several years, is a reproductive adaptation displayed by many tree species. The predator satiation hypothesis predicts that starvation of seed predators between mast years and satiation during mast years decreases seed predation and thus enhances tree regeneration. 2. Mast fruiting comes at demographic costs such as missed reproduction opportunities and increased density-dependence of recruits, but it remains unknown if predator satiation constitutes a sufficiently large benefit for masting to evolve as a viable life-history strategy. So far, no studies have quantified the net fitness consequences of masting. 3. Using a long-term demographic data set of the dipterocarp Shorea leprosula in a Malaysian forest, we constructed stochastic matrix population models and performed a demographic cost–benefit analysis. 4. For observed values of mast frequency and seed predation rates, we show that strict masting strongly increases fitness compared with fruiting annually. Model results also show that the demographic costs of mast fruiting are very low compared to the demographic losses due to seed predation in a scenario of annual fruiting. Finally, we find that mast fruiting would still be selected for even at low levels of seed predation and when including additional costs such as decreased adult growth rates, limiting crop size and density-dependent seedling survival. 5. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the predator satiation hypothesis: mast fruiting increases fitness for a range of seed predation levels. Under seed predation pressure annually fruiting species are at a strong disadvantage and as a result a mast fruiting strategy may swiftly confer a fitness advantage. Our study shows that demographic modelling allows the weighing of fitness benefits and costs of life-history phenomena such as strict masting.

TI  - Roles of pathogens on replacement of tree seedlings in heterogeneous light environments in a temperate forest: a reciprocal seed sowing experiment
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary
1.In forest communities, the Janzen–Connell (J-C) hypothesis proposes that species diversity is maintained by non-competitive distance- and/or density-dependent seedling mortality caused by host-specific natural enemies. However, the effects of pathogen associations from nearby conspecifics vs. heterospecifics remain unknown in spatially heterogeneous light environments.

2.Seeds of hardwood species Cornus controversa (Cornus) and Prunus grayana (Prunus) were sown beneath 6–7 Cornus and Prunus adults in both the forest understory (FU) and in gaps (Gap) created by felling all woody vegetation near the focal adults. Seedling growth, mortality, killing agents (e.g. pathogens that cause damping-off and leaf diseases), and root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were investigated.

3.We found strong habitat effects on the expression of soil fungi beneath both tree species. Seedling mortality caused by soil-borne damping-off pathogens was greater in FU than in Gap, and AMF infection, which enhanced relative seedling growth rate, was greater in Gap than in FU. Seedling mortality caused by damping-off pathogens did not differ between Cornus and Prunus seedlings beneath the adults of conspecific or heterospecific adults in both FU and Gap, suggesting little distance-dependence or host preference in the fungus.

4.Beneath the adults of Cornus and Prunus, the most prevalent leaf diseases were zonate leaf blight and angular leaf spot caused by the airborne pathogenic fungi Haradamyces foliicola and Phaeoisariopsis pruni-grayanae, respectively. Although these pathogens attacked the seedlings of both species, conspecific seedlings (i.e. home) showed more severe leaf damage, earlier leaf shedding and/or less defensive behaviour (cell wall defence) relative to heterospecific seedlings (i.e. away), suggesting negative distance-dependent attack (i.e. host preference) for these leaf diseases. As a result, greater seedling mortality was observed for conspecific seedlings under both FU and Gap treatments.

5.Synthesis. In the temperate forest, the J-C hypothesis is largely mediated through the strong negative influence of airborne leaf diseases rather than through soil-borne damping-off pathogens. We found that airborne diseases demonstrated distance-dependent host preferences, which led to greater conspecific seedling damage regardless of environmental light conditions.

TI  - Widespread density‐dependent seedling mortality promotes species coexistence in a highly diverse Amazonian rain forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Negative density-dependent mortality can promote species coexistence through a spacing mechanism that prevents species from becoming too locally abundant. Negative density-dependent seedling mortality can be caused by interactions among seedlings or between seedlings and neighboring adults if the density of neighbors affects the strength of competition or facilitates the attack of natural enemies. We investigated the effects of seedling and adult neighborhoods on the survival of newly recruited seedlings for multiple cohorts of known age from 163 species in Yasuni National Park, Ecuador, an ever-wet, hyper-diverse lowland Amazonian rain forest. At local scales, we found a strong negative impact on first-year survival of conspecific seedling densities and adult abundance in multiple neighborhood sizes and a beneficial effect of a local tree neighborhood that is distantly related to the focal seedling. Once seedlings have survived their first year, they also benefit from a more phylogenetically dispersed seedling neighborhood. Across species, we did not find evidence that rare species have an advantage relative to more common species, or a community compensatory trend. These results suggest that the local biotic neighborhood is a strong influence on early seedling survival for species that range widely in their abundance and life history. These patterns in seedling survival demonstrate the role of density-dependent seedling dynamics in promoting and maintaining diversity in understory seedling assemblages. The assemblage-wide impacts of species abundance distributions may multiply with repeated cycles of recruitment and density-dependent seedling mortality and impact forest diversity or the abundance of individual species over longer time scales.

TI  - Mortality, Population and Community Dynamics of the Glass Sponge Dominated Community “The Forest of the Weird” From the Ridge Seamount, Johnston Atoll, Pacific Ocean
PY  - 2020
AB  - The ecosystem dynamics of benthic communities depend on the relative importance of organism reproductive traits, environmental factors, inter-specific interactions and mortality processes. The fine-scale community ecology of sessile organisms can be investigated using spatial analyses because the position of the specimens on the substrate (their spatial positions) reflects the biological and ecological processes that they were subject to in-life. Consequently, spatial point process analyses (SPPA) and Bayesian network inference (BNI) can be used to reveal key insights into the ecological dynamics of these deep-sea communities. Here we use these analyses to investigate the ecology of deep-sea glass sponge dominated community "The Forest of the Weird" (2442m depth, Ridge Seamount, Johnston Atoll, Pacific Ocean). A 3D reconstruction was made of this community using photogrammetry of video stills taken from high-resolution ROV video. The community was dominated by two genera of Hexactinellids: Farreidae Aspidoscopulia sp. and Euplectellidae Bolosominae sp. with octocorals Narella bowersi, Narella macrocalyx and Rhodaniridogorgia also present in large proportions. SPPA of the dead versus alive organisms revealed a random distribution of dead amongst the living, showing a non-density dependent cause of death for the majority of taxa. However, in the high-density ridge crest region there was non-random aggregation of dead specimens, revealing density-dependent mortality for Aspidoscopulia. SPPA showed that the glass sponges and octocorals were each most strongly influenced by different underlying processes, and reacted to the environmental conditions differently. The octocorals responded to higher density areas with increased intra-specific competition, whilst the glass-sponges seemed impervious to a doubling of specimen density. BNI found that mutual habitat associations between different taxa resulted in inter-specific competition at larger (2-4m) spatial scales, with instances of competition at small-spatial scales (<0.75m) in the higher-density ridge crest section. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the mortality, population and community dynamics of a deep-sea sponge community using spatial point process analyses. Our results provide the first insight into the variety of ecological behaviors of these different glass sponges and octocorals, and show how these different organisms have developed diverse responses to the biological and environmental gradients within their habitat.

TI  - Do fungal pathogens drive density-dependent mortality in established seedlings of two dominant African rain-forest trees?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Where one or a few tree species reach local high abundance, different ecological factors may variously facilitate or hinder their regeneration. Plant pathogens are thought to be one of those possible agents which drive intraspecific density-dependent mortality of tree seedlings in tropical forests. Experimental evidence for this is scarce, however. In an African rain forest at Korup, we manipulated the density of recently established seedlings (~5–8 wk old; low vs. high-density) of two dominant species of contrasting recruitment potential, and altered their exposure to pathogens using a broad-spectrum fungicide. Seedling mortality of the abundantly recruiting subcanopy tree Oubanguia alata was strongly density-dependent after 7 mo, yet fungicide-treated seedlings had slightly higher mortality than controls. By contrast, seedling mortality of the poorly recruiting large canopy-emergent tree Microberlinia bisulcata was unaffected by density or fungicide. Ectomycorrhizal colonization of M. bisulcata was not affected by density or fungicide either. For O. alata, adverse effects of fungicide on its vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizas may have offset any possible benefit of pathogen removal. We tentatively conclude that fungal pathogens are not a likely major cause of density dependence in O. alata, or of early post-establishment mortality in M. bisulcata. They do not explain the latter's currently very low recruitment rate at Korup.

TI  - Spatial patterns of coral survivorship: impacts of adult proximity versus other drivers of localized mortality
PY  - 2015
AB  - Species-specific enemies may promote prey coexistence through negative distance- and density-dependent survival of juveniles near conspecific adults. We tested this mechanism by transplanting juvenile-sized fragments of the brooding corals Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix 3, 12, 24 and 182 cm up- and down-current of conspecific adults and monitoring their survival and condition over time. We also characterized the spatial distribution of P. damicornis and S. hystrix within replicate plots on three Fijian reef flats and measured the distribution of small colonies within 2 m of larger colonies of each species. Juvenile-sized transplants exhibited no differences in survivorship as a function of distance from adult P. damicornis or S. hystrix. Additionally, both P. damicornis and S. hystrix were aggregated rather than overdispersed on natural reefs. However, a pattern of juveniles being aggregated near adults while larger (and probably older) colonies were not suggests that greater mortality near large adults could occur over longer periods of time or that size-dependent mortality was occurring. While we found minimal evidence of greater mortality of small colonies near adult conspecifics in our transplant experiments, we did document hot-spots of species-specific corallivory. We detected spatially localized and temporally persistent predation on P. damicornis by the territorial triggerfish Balistapus undulatus. This patchy predation did not occur for S. hystrix. This variable selective regime in an otherwise more uniform environment could be one mechanism maintaining diversity of corals on Indo-Pacific reefs.

TI  - Seedling recruitment in a hurricane-driven tropical forest: light limitation, density-dependence and the spatial distribution of parent trees
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary 1 We used inverse modelling to parameterize spatially-explicit seedling recruitment functions for nine canopy tree species in the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), Puerto Rico. We modelled the observed spatial variation in seedling recruitment following Hurricane Georges as a function of the potential number of seedlings at a given location (based on local source trees and the potential contribution of parents from outside of the mapped area) and of light levels and density-dependent mortality during establishment. We adopted the model comparison paradigm and compared the performance of increasingly complex models against a null model that assumes uniform seedling distribution across the plot. 2 Our data supported a model in which parents must reach a threshold size before any seedling production will occur. Once parents attain that size, the relationship between tree diameter and the number of seedlings produced is fairly flat for the majority of species. These results contradict previous analyses that simply assumed a linear relationship between biomass and seedling production and a uniform size threshold for seedling production across species. 3 The majority of species tested supported models that included at least one of a bath term (contribution from non-local trees), conspecific density dependence and light availability after the hurricane. Density dependence shifted the mode of the effective dispersal kernel away from potential parent trees and significantly reduced the number of seedlings established near parent trees. Recruitment from non-local sources accounted for 6‐81% of observed seedling recruitment depending upon the tree species. Light availability appeared to divide species into three groups that showed more successful seedling establishment at low ( 30% full sun). 4 Differences between individual species in the importance of local vs. bath recruitment and the intensity of density dependence suggest the existence of distinct recruitment syndromes that go beyond the traditional focus of tropical tree life histories. Understanding these syndromes will provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of tropical tree species and the maintenance of tropical forest diversity.

TI  - Post-dispersal factors influence recruitment patterns but do not override the importance of seed limitation in populations of a native thistle
PY  - 2020
AB  - Whether plant populations are limited by seed or microsite availability is a long-standing debate. However, since both can be important, increasing emphasis is placed on disentangling their relative importance and how they vary through space and time. Although uncommon, seed addition studies that include multiple levels of seed augmentation, and follow plants through to the adult stage, are critical to achieving this goal. Such data are also vital to understanding when biotic pressures, such as herbivory, influence plant abundance. In this study, we experimentally added seeds of a native thistle, Cirsium canescens, at four augmentation densities to plots at two long-term study sites and quantified densities of seedlings and reproductive adults over 9 years. Recruitment to both seedling and adult stages was strongly seed-limited at both sites; however, the relative strength of seed limitation decreased with plant age. Fitting alternative recruitment functions to our data indicated that post-dispersal mortality factors were important as well. Strong density-dependent mortality limited recruitment at one site, while density-independent limitation predominated at the other. Overall, our experimental seed addition demonstrates that the environment at these sites remains suitable for C. canescens survival to reproduction and that seed availability limits adult densities. The results thus provide support for the hypothesis that seed losses due to the invasive weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus, rather than shifting microsite conditions, are driving C. canescens population declines. Shifts in the importance of density-dependent recruitment limitation between sites highlights that alternate strategies may be necessary to recover plant populations at different locations.

TI  - Protection status and density-dependent effects mediate the abundance-suitability relationship of a threatened species
PY  - 2022
AB  - Niche theory predicts that species abundance should increase with environmental suitability, but this relationship is highly variable across species. Understanding the causes of this variation is key to guide conservation actions, especially for threatened species. Here we test whether two potentially important but rarely considered factors, protection status and density-dependence, mediate the abundance-suitability relationship in the threatened and overexploited palm Euterpe edulis. We obtained population density data of E. edulis from 50 sites across the Atlantic Forest and estimated environmental suitability from niche modelling. We classified palm populations as low- or high-density, and as protected or unprotected based on the location of the populations (inside or outside protected areas, respectively). The overall abundance-suitability relationship was positive (R2 = 0.32). Inclusion of protection status increased the explanatory power of the models (R2 = 0.46). The abundance-suitability relationship was positive in low-density and in unprotected populations, but neutral in high-density and in protected populations. These patterns suggest that density-dependent factors mediate the abundance-suitability relationship in E. edulis. Our findings show, for the first time, that protection status is an important factor regulating the abundance-suitability relationship, and suggest that unprotected populations may be more vulnerable to future changes in environmental suitability due to climate change. Explicit inclusion of density-dependence and protection status in explanatory models in future studies may increase understanding of abundance variation across species’ geographical ranges, particularly for overexploited species.

TI  - Frugivorous bats promote epizoochoric seed dispersal and seedling survival in a disturbed Neotropical forest
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Animal-dispersed plants usually rely upon multiple dispersers. In many ecosystems, most of these interactions have yet to be explored; thus, documenting the extent of contribution of each animal partner to the reproduction and survival of plant species is key to understanding the ecology and evolution of animal–plant mutualism, as well as the potential responses of the ecological networks to biodiversity loss through defaunation. Here, by characterizing the outcomes and differences of the epizoochoric seed dispersal carried out by two species of frugivorous bats (Artibeus phaeotis and Uroderma convexum) in a Neotropical forest, we tested the prediction that, through their feeding activity, both bat species disperse and influence the subsequent seedling survival of multiple seed species. By direct sampling on bats’ dispersing sites and surrounding areas, we found evidence of the dispersal of 2,310 seeds of eight plant species, of which 118 survived to become seedlings. The total density of seeds and the seedling survival were significantly higher in areas directly influenced by the bats (i.e., feeding roosts) than in peripheral areas. Positive density-dependent effects nevertheless were detected in both sampling areas (feeding roosts and peripheral areas). Interspecific comparisons showed that despite both bat species having similar dispersal outcomes, seedlings in peripheral areas related to A. phaeotis have better survival rates. Our results demonstrate that both bat species primarily disperse by epizoochoric means seeds of various tree species at several localities in the study site. This result, together with the positive density-dependent effects, suggests that bats are moving seeds away from maternal trees and depositing them in locations where some of the seeds can germinate, establish, and survive, thereby highlighting the positive contribution of these bat species to the reproductive success of trees inhabiting Neotropical habitats. Our results contribute to the growing knowledge of frugivorous interactions on hyperdiverse forests and the role of small vertebrates on seed dispersal mutualisms.</jats:p>

TI  - Invertebrate predators drive distance-dependent patterns of seedling mortality in a temperate tree Acer pseudoplatanus
PY  - 2008
AB  - There is growing evidence that distance- and density-dependent recruitment are important factors in structuring tree communities in temperate forests. Although pathogens have generally been assumed to be driving these patterns, few studies have attempted to experimentally identify the agent responsible. Here we investigate patterns of recruitment in sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, a temperate tree species, in its exotic range in Britain. Seedling mortality, the limiting stage in sycamore regeneration, was monitored with respect to the proximity and density of adult sycamores and seedlings in a grid of sampling units. We found that mortality was significantly greater beneath adult sycamores compared with heterospecifics, and was further elevated in areas of high conspecific basal area, a proxy for biomass. An experimental approach that manipulated the access of predators to seedlings demonstrated that herbivorous invertebrates were responsible for driving these distance- and biomass-dependent trends in mortality. Evidence of stem damage on dead seedlings suggests that slugs are the principal cause of mortality, although there was only partial evidence of higher slug activity beneath sycamores. The implications of these findings for sycamore invasion, species co-existence and management are discussed.

TI  - Reexamining the storage effect: Why temporal variation in abiotic factors seems unlikely to cause coexistence
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The temporal storage effect—that species coexist by partitioning abiotic niches that vary in time—is thought to be an important explanation for how species coexist. However, empirical studies that measure multiple mechanisms often find the storage effect is weak. We believe this mismatch is because of a shortcoming of theoretical models used to study the storage effect: that while the storage effect is described as having just three requirements (partitioning of temporal variation, buffered population growth, and a covariance between environment and density‐dependence), models used to study the storage effect make four assumptions, which are mathematically subtle but biologically important. In this paper, we examine those assumptions. First, models assume that environmental variation leads to a rapid impact on density‐dependence. We find that delays in density‐dependence (including delays caused by competition between cohorts) weaken the storage effect. Second, models assume that intraspecific competition is almost identical to interspecific competition. We find that unless resource or predator partitioning are virtually absent, then variation‐independent mechanisms will overshadow the benefits of the storage effect. Third, models assume even though there is vast variation in the environment, species are equally adapted on average (i.e., zero fitness‐differences). We show that fitness differences are particularly problematic in the storage effect because specializing on temporally rare niches is far less effective than specializing on other types of rare niches. Finally, models assume that stochastic extinctions can be ignored, and invader growth can determine coexistence. We show that storage effects tend to reduce mean persistence times, even if invader growth rates are positive. These results suggest that the assumptions needed for the storage effect are strict: if the first or second assumption is relaxed, it will greatly weaken the stabilizing mechanism; if the third or fourth assumption is relaxed, it will create a diversity‐destroying effect that may undermine coexistence. We examine three real‐world communities—annual plants, tropical forests, and iguanid lizards—and find that empirical studies suggest that all three communities violate multiple assumptions. This suggests that the temporal storage effect is probably not an important explanation for species diversity in most systems.</jats:p>

TI  - Linking traits of foraging animals to spatial patterns of plants: social and solitary ants generate opposing patterns of surviving seeds
PY  - 2007
AB  - Foraging traits of seed predators are expected to impact the spatial structure of plant populations, community dynamics and diversity. Yet, many of the key mechanisms governing distance- or density-dependent seed predation are poorly understood. We designed an extensive set of field experiments to test how seed predation by two harvester ant species interact with seed dispersal in shaping the spatial patterns of surviving seeds. We show that the Janzen-Connell establishment pattern can be generated by central-place foragers even if their focal point is located away from the seed source. Furthermore, we found that differences in the social behaviour of seed predators influence their sensitivity to seed density gradients and yield opposing spatial patterns of surviving seeds. Our results support the predictions of a recent theoretical framework that unifies apparently opposing plant establishment patterns, and suggest that differences in foraging traits among seed predators can drive divergent pathways of plant community dynamics.

TI  - Testing for Janzen–Connell Effects in a West African Montane Forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - The Janzen–Connell hypothesis proposes that density dependent seed and seedling mortality, combined with increasing seed and seedling survival away from the parent tree, together promote regular spacing of species and thus a diversity. This hypothesis has rarely been tested in tropical Africa, and rarely in montane forests anywhere. We tested this hypothesis using a combination of field experiments and observations in the most floristically diverse dry submontane forest in Nigeria. We investigated distance effects on seedling herbivory, seedling survival and seedling height growth. We found a significant decrease in herbivory with distance from conspecific adult trees for all three species of experimentally planted seedlings (Entandrophragma angolense, Deinbollia pinnata and Sterculia setigera), and also for naturally occurring seedlings of Pouteria altissima but not of Newtonia buchananii or Isolona pleurocarpa. The relative density of large seedlings/saplings of P. altissima, N. buchananii and I. pleurocarpa increased significantly at greater distance from conspecific adult trees; however, we found no significant distance effect on survival or height growth over 3 mo for all three experimentally planted species. Taken together, our results are some of the first to show that Janzen–Connell effects occur on the African continent and in particular montane tropical forest and suggest that such effects may be pantropical.

TI  - Common spatial patterns of trees in various tropical forests: Small trees are associated with increased diversity at small spatial scales
PY  - 2021
AB  - Tropical forests are notable for their high species diversity, even on small spatial scales, and right-skewed species and size abundance distributions. The role of individual species as drivers of the spatial organization of diversity in these forests has been explained by several hypotheses and processes, for example, stochastic dilution, negative density dependence, or gap dynamics. These processes leave a signature in spatial distribution of small trees, particularly in the vicinity of large trees, likely having stronger effects on their neighbors. We are exploring species diversity patterns within the framework of various diversity-generating hypotheses using individual species-area relationships. We used the data from three tropical forest plots (Wanang-Papua New Guinea, Barro Colorado Island-Panama, and Sinharaja-Sri Lanka) and included also the saplings (DBH ≥ 1 cm). Resulting cross-size patterns of species richness and evenness reflect the dynamics of saplings affected by the distribution of large trees. When all individuals with DBH ≥1 cm are included, ~50% of all tree species from the 25- or 50-ha plot can be found within 35 m radius of an individual tree. For all trees, 72%-78% of species were identified as species richness accumulators, having more species present in their surroundings than expected by null models. This pattern was driven by small trees as the analysis of DBH >10 cm trees showed much lower proportion of accumulators, 14%-65% of species identified as richness repellers and had low richness of surrounding small trees. Only 11%-26% of species had lower species evenness than was expected by null models. High proportions of species richness accumulators were probably due to gap dynamics and support Janzen-Connell hypothesis driven by competition or top-down control by pathogens and herbivores. Observed species diversity patterns show the importance of including small tree size classes in analyses of the spatial organization of diversity.

TI  - Fates of seedling carpets in an Amazonian floodplain forest: intra‐cohort competition or attack by enemies?
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary


1. The operation of ‘negative density-dependence’ in seedling cohorts in tropical forests is empirically well-established, but only at a phenomenological level that leaves open the question of why seedlings conspecific with an overtopping parent tree experience higher mortality than heterospecifics. The distinction is of theoretical importance because distinct mechanisms are involved.



2. We consider the two most debated possibilities: seedling mortality resulting from classical Lotka–Volterra density-dependence and seedling mortality resulting from the action of biotic agents, as postulated for the Janzen–Connell mechanism. Our study is the first to identify the full spectrum of mortality factors affecting both conspecific and heterospecific members of seedling cohorts.



3. We took advantage of the occurrence of ‘seedling carpets’, dense concentrations of seedlings that appear following fruiting events under reproductive individuals of some species. In these ‘carpets’, seedlings conspecific with the overtopping parent tree predominate numerically, but heterospecific seedlings are also typically present. Here, we investigated the differential survival of conspecific versus heterospecific seedlings under focal trees of four species: Calatola microcarpa (Icacinaceae), Clarisia racemosa (Moraceae), Matisia cordata (Bombacaceae/Malvaceae) and Sorocea pileata (Moraceae).



4. We show that mortality rates of conspecific seedlings are much higher than those of heterospecific seedlings and that most conspecific mortality (64–100%) resulted from host-restricted arthropod herbivores and/or fungal pathogens, whereas the mortality of heterospecific seedlings resulted from a variety of other causes.



5. Synthesis. Conspecific seedlings died following attack by apparently host-restricted arthropods or fungi and eventually experienced 100% mortality. The results are inconsistent with classical intra- and inter-specific competition and consistent with the actions of distance-responsive and/or density-responsive ‘enemies’, as postulated 40 years ago by Janzen and Connell.

TI  - Neighbourhood effects influence drought-induced mortality of savanna trees in Australia
PY  - 2010
AB  - Questions: The following hypotheses of neighbourhood effects on drought-induced mortality are evaluated: (A) drought-induced stem death is randomly distributed in space, (B) stems are predisposed to drought-induced death through negative density-dependent effects and (C) stems are predisposed to drought-induced death due to local deficits in plant available resources.



Location: Central Queensland, Australia.



Methods: Recent mass mortality of woody stems was surveyed and mapped in three 1.21-ha quadrats within Eucalyptus melanophloia-dominated savanna. A multi-faceted analytical approach was adopted including spatial pattern analyses, two logistic regressions of neighbourhood density effects on survival and spatial autocorrelation analyses of model residuals.



Results: Mortality was concentrated in stems ≤15-cm diameter at breast height (DBH). Survival was aggregated or random in quadrats 1 and 3 and random o regular in quadrat 2. Small neighbour density had a negative effect on survival in all quadrats. In addition, the second model identified a positive relationship between survival and living neighbour density in quadrat 3 (indicating a resource patch effect), but a negative relationship in quadrat 2 (density effect). Analysis of model residuals showed that neighbour density explained mortality equally well across quadrat 2, but not across quadrats 1 and 3.



Conclusions: There was evidence in support of hypotheses B (neighbour density) and C (resource heterogeneity). We found strong support for an interaction between microsite quality and neighbourhood stem densities, and suggest that this interaction is driven by plant available water.

TI  - Lower within-community variance of negative density dependence increases forest diversity.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Local abundance of adult trees impedes growth of conspecific seedlings through host-specific enemies, a mechanism first proposed by Janzen and Connell to explain plant diversity in forests. While several studies suggest the importance of this mechanism, there is still little information of how the variance of negative density dependence (NDD) affects diversity of forest communities. With computer simulations, we analyzed the impact of strength and variance of NDD within tree communities on species diversity. We show that stronger NDD leads to higher species diversity. Furthermore, lower range of strengths of NDD within a community increases species richness and decreases variance of species abundances. Our results show that, beyond the average strength of NDD, the variance of NDD is also crucially important to explain species diversity. This can explain the dissimilarity of biodiversity between tropical and temperate forest: highly diverse forests could have lower NDD variance. This report suggests that natural enemies and the variety of the magnitude of their effects can contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity.

TI  - Pre‐dispersal seed predation could help explain premature fruit drop in a tropical forest
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Pre‐dispersal seed mortality caused by premature fruit drop is a potentially important source of plant mortality, but one which has rarely been studied in the context of tropical forest plants. Of particular interest is premature fruit drop triggered by enemies, which—if density dependent—could contribute to species coexistence in tropical forest plant communities.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We used a long‐term (31 year) dataset on seed and fruit fall obtained through weekly collections from a network of seed traps in a lowland tropical forest (Barro Colorado Island, Panama) to estimate the proportion of seeds prematurely abscised for 201 woody plant species. To determine whether enemy attack might contribute to premature fruit drop, we tested whether plant species abscise more of their fruit prematurely if they (a) have attributes hypothesised to be associated with high levels of enemy attack and (b) are known to be attacked by one enemy group (insect seed predators). We also tested (c) whether mean rates of premature fruit drop for plant species are phylogenetically conserved.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Overall rates of premature fruit drop were high in the plant community. Across all species, 39% of seeds were abscised before completing their development. Rates of premature seed abscission varied considerably among species and could not be explained by phylogeny. Premature seed abscission rates were higher in species which are known to host pre‐dispersal insect seed predators and species with attributes that were hypothesised to make them more susceptible to attack by pre‐dispersal enemies, namely species which (a) have larger seeds, (b) have a greater average height, (c) have temporally predictable fruiting patterns and (d) are more abundant at the study site.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Premature fruit drop is likely to be a major source of seed mortality for many plant species on Barro Colorado Island. It is plausible that pre‐dispersal seed enemies, such as insect seed predators, contribute to community‐level patterns of premature fruit drop and have the potential to mediate species coexistence through stabilising negative density dependence. Our study suggests that the role of pre‐dispersal enemies in structuring tropical plant communities should be considered alongside the more commonly studied post‐dispersal seed and seedling enemies.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Insect herbivory on seedlings of rainforest trees: Effects of density and distance of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Natural enemies of plants such as insect herbivores can contribute to structuring and maintaining plant diversity in tropical forests. Most research in this area has focused on the role of specialized enemies and the extent to which herbivory on individual plant species is density‐dependent. Relatively few insect herbivores specialize on a single host plant species. Insect herbivores that feed on more than one plant species may link the regeneration dynamics of their host species through “apparent competition” or “apparent mutualism.” We investigated herbivory and survival of seedlings of two tropical tree species (Cordia alliodora and Cordia bicolor) in the forests of Barro Colorado Island (Panama). We used experiments and observations to assess seedling fate in relation to the presence of conspecifics and heterospecifics across a range of spatial scales. Herbivory significantly increased seedling mortality and was highest at high local densities of C. alliodora seedlings. There was also evidence that high local densities of C. alliodora increased herbivory on co‐occurring C. bicolor seedlings. Synthesis. The elevated rates of seedling herbivory at high densities of conspecifics documented in our study are consistent with the predictions of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, which explains how so many plant species can coexist in tropical forests. Our data also highlight the possibility that herbivore‐mediated density‐dependence, facilitated by herbivores that feed on multiple plant species, can also occur across plant species. Enemy‐mediated indirect effects of this sort have the potential to structure plant communities.

TI  - Biotic vs. Abiotic Drivers of Seedling Persistence in a Tropical Karst Forest
PY  - 2016
AB  - Question
Quantifying the duration and drivers of seedling persistence is critical for understanding seedling dynamics and species coexistence in plant communities. In this study, we incorporated data from multiple seedling censuses to characterize patterns of seedling persistence in a tropical karst forest. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of density dependence, habitat heterogeneity, and recruitment timing on seedling persistence.

Location
A tropical karst forest in Taiwan.

Methods
Using data from 144 seedling plots censused every three months from 2007 to 2012, we examined persistence times of 6399 seedlings of 36 species. Seedling survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Mixed effects Cox models were used to identify significant biotic (i.e., initial height, conspecific and heterospecific seedling and adult densities) and abiotic (i.e., mean elevation, convexity, slope, effective soil depth, and recruitment time) drivers of seedling persistence at the community, guild and species levels.

Results
At the community level, newly recruited seedlings had a median survival time of 6 months. Median survival time was higher for seedlings in the shade-tolerant guild compared to seedlings in the shade-intolerant guild (9 vs. 3 months). When all species were analyzed together, seedling persistence significantly increased with increasing initial size and soil depth and significantly decreased with increasing density of conspecific and heterospecific seedling neighbors. Drivers of seedling persistence tended to be guild- and species-specific, however negative effects of conspecific seedling neighbors were consistently detected in all models, indicating strong and pervasive conspecific negative density dependence. Significant effects of recruitment time, soil depth and convexity were revealed by guild- and species-specific models, suggesting abiotic niche differences.

Conclusions
This study highlights the importance of multiple ecological processes for seedling persistence. Both abiotic and biotic factors may play an important role in species coexistence in this forest via niche partitioning and negative density dependence. Among these factors, negative conspecific density dependence had the strongest and most consistent effect. In addition, soil depth played a key role in shaping seedling regeneration, likely through effects of soil moisture. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the ecology of karst forests. Analyzing seedling persistence in karst forest expands our general understanding of forest dynamics and species coexistence in tropical forests as a whole, especially at sites with high spatial heterogeneity.

TI  - Neighbour-regulated mortality: the influence of positive and negative density dependence on tree populations in species-rich tropical forests
PY  - 2003
AB  - Density-dependent mortality has long been posited as a possible mechanism for the regulation of tropical forest tree density. Despite numerous experimental and phenomenological investigations, the extent to which such mechanisms operate in tropical forests remains unresolved because the demographical signature of density dependence has rarely been found in extensive investigations of established trees. This study used an individual-based demographical approach to investigate the role of conspecific and heterospecific neighbourhood crowding on tree mortality in a Panamanian and a Malayan tropical forest. More than 80% of the species investigated at each site were found to exhibit density-dependent mortality. Furthermore, most of these species showed patterns of mortality consistent with the Janzen‐Connell hypothesis and the rarely explored hypothesis of species herd protection. This study presents some of the first evidence of species herd protection operating in tree communities.

TI  - The unexpected influence of legacy conspecific density dependence.
PY  - 2024
AB  - When plants die, neighbours escape competition. Living conspecifics could disproportionately benefit because they are freed from negative intraspecific processes; however, if the negative effects of past conspecific neighbours persist, other species might be advantaged, and diversity might be maintained through legacy effects. We examined legacy effects in a mapped forest by modelling the survival of 37,212 trees of 23 species using four neighbourhood properties: living conspecific, living heterospecific, legacy conspecific (dead conspecifics) and legacy heterospecific densities. Legacy conspecific effects proved nearly four times stronger than living conspecific effects; changes in annual survival associated with legacy conspecific density were 1.5% greater than living conspecific effects. Over 90% of species were negatively impacted by legacy conspecific density, compared to 47% by living conspecific density. Our results emphasize that legacies of trees alter community dynamics, revealing that prior research may have underestimated the strength of density dependent interactions by not considering legacy effects.

TI  - Large mammalian herbivores contribute to conspecific negative density dependence in a temperate forest
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The Janzen–Connell Hypothesis (JCH) predicts that density‐responsive and host‐specific natural enemies limit the population sizes of abundant species. Importantly, these interactions help to maintain local community diversity through time. While ample evidence exists for the demographic predictions of the JCH, it remains unclear which natural enemies drive these dynamics across different plant communities.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>While large mammalian herbivores are often assumed to lack the specialized diet needed to drive Janzen–Connell effects, they do show a degree of host‐preference that could drive density‐dependent plant demography. However, the potential role of large mammalian herbivores in Janzen–Connell interactions has only rarely been investigated.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Using 204 seedling transects (1 m × 10 m) at 51 sites across a 900‐ha forested reserve in southwestern Pennsylvania (USA), we examined the role that large mammals play in driving conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) in temperate tree seedlings. Individual fences were erected around half of the transects (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 102) to exclude large mammals, and were paired with adjacent unfenced transects. Within transects, a total of ~15,000 individual seedlings were monitored over three growing seasons.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Demographic neighbourhood models were constructed to examine the influence of neighbourhood composition and density on seedling survival and growth. An interaction term between conspecific neighbour density and fencing treatment was included to test the hypothesis that large herbivores cause CNDD.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that seedling survival was influenced by both conspecific neighbour density and fencing. CNDD was strongest when large mammals were allowed access to seedlings, and these results were driven by two abundant taxa (<jats:italic>Prunus serotina</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Fraxinus</jats:italic> spp). Despite evidence that large mammals mediate CNDD, we found no effect of fencing on rarified species richness or evenness in seedling transects during the study.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Understanding the specific natural enemies driving conspecific negative density dependence remains vital for understanding the maintenance of forest diversity across the globe. Our results indicate that large mammalian herbivores are capable of driving CNDD in temperate tree species. These results suggest that large mammals may be an important and generally overlooked agent contributing to Janzen–Connell interactions in forest communities. We expect that further research examining large mammals in other systems will be important in the future.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Drivers of tree demographic trade-offs in a temperate forest
PY  - 2022
AB  - The demographic trade-offs (i.e. growth and survival) play important roles in forest dynamics and they are driven by multiple factors, including species' inherent life-history strategies (such as shade-tolerance and mycorrhizal type), neighborhood interactions (such as conspecific negative density dependence, CNDD), and abiotic environment pressures. Although studies found that CNDD occurred in tropical and temperate forest, attempts to identify how the variations in CNDD control their impacts on growth and survival remain debate. In the present study, we conducted an extensive field survey, and analyzed demographic rates from 24 co-occurring temperate tree species, in order to test the importance of CNDD in shaping the growth-survival trade-offs. Our study found that density dependence and environmental filtering were strong predictors for individual growth-survival trade-offs, while they showed variations across shade-intolerant and ectomycorrhizal species, as well as saplings and juveniles with more negative CNDD. Species growth showed positive relationship with mortality. And our results also support the fact that CNDD drives species growth-survival trade-offs at the community level with environmental stress. Our study indicates that biotic interactions such as density dependence and environment filtering played an important role in growth-survival trade-offs, and confirmed that the Janzen-Connell hypothesis in temperate forest was associated with species life-history strategies. In addition, shade-tolerance, mycorrhizal type and life-stage of forest species responded differently to CNDD, thus providing insights regarding different community assembly mechanisms and their interactions. Therefore, it is important to take species survival with growth and species life-history strategies into account when focusing on forest dynamics.

TI  - Mutualist and pathogen traits interact to affect plant community structure in a spatially explicit model
PY  - 2020
AB  - Empirical studies show that plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) can generate negative density dependent (NDD) recruitment capable of maintaining plant community diversity at landscape scales. However, the observation that common plants often exhibit relatively weaker NDD than rare plants at local scales is difficult to reconcile with the maintenance of overall plant diversity. We develop a spatially explicit simulation model that tracks the community dynamics of microbial mutualists, pathogens, and their plant hosts. We find that net PSF effects vary as a function of both host abundance and key microbial traits (e.g., host affinity) in ways that are compatible with both common plants exhibiting relatively weaker local NDD, while promoting overall species diversity. The model generates a series of testable predictions linking key microbial traits and the relative abundance of host species, to the strength and scale of PSF and overall plant community diversity.

TI  - Low-intensity logging and hunting have long-term effects on seed dispersal but not fecundity in Afrotropical forests.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Hunting and logging, ubiquitous human disturbances in tropical forests, have the potential to alter the ecological processes that govern population recruitment and community composition. Hunting-induced declines in populations of seed-dispersing animals are expected to reduce dispersal of the tree species that rely on them, resulting in potentially greater distance- and density-dependent mortality. At the same time, selective logging may alter competitive interactions among tree species, releasing remaining trees from light, nutrient or space limitations. Taken together, these disturbances may alter the community composition of tropical forests, with implications for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. To evaluate the effects of hunting and logging on tree fecundity and seed dispersal, we use 3 years of seed rain data from a large-scale observational experiment in previously logged, hunted and protected forests in northern Republic of Congo (Brazzaville). We find that low-intensity logging had a meaningful long-term effect on species-specific seed dispersal distances, though the direction and magnitude varied and was not congruent within dispersal vector. Tree fecundity increased with tree diameter, but did not differ appreciably across disturbance regimes. The species-specific dispersal responses to logging in this study point towards the long-lasting toll of disturbance on ecological function and highlight the necessity of conserving intact forest.

AB  - • Density dependence is a major mechanism for shaping plant communities. However, its role in regulating diverse, mixed natural tree communities is less certain. • In this study we investigated density-dependent effects in a large-scale (25 ha) old-growth temperate forest in northeastern China. Spatial patterns of neighborhood distribution in the plot were analyzed using various methods for inferring competition, including (1) pair correlation function to determine spatial patterns of pre-mortality and post-mortality and (2) neighborhood analysis of individuals to examine the extent to which tree survival is correlated with other covariates. • Results showed that, for common species, 3 of 5 canopy species and 3 of 8 midstory and understory species were random in mortality. Negative density-dependent mortality was not found when trees reach 1 cm in DBH. There was no significant correlation for canopy species between tree survival and conspecific abundance, but largely positive correlations for midstory and understory species. In contrast, tree survival was found to negatively correlate with conspecific basal area for most species, indicating strong intraspecific competition. No strong interspecific density dependence was found in the forest.

TI  - Abiotic and Biotic Influences on Early-Stage Survival in Two Shade-Tolerant Tree Species in Brazil's Atlantic Forest
PY  - 2013
AB  - Regeneration dynamics in tropical forests are driven by many abiotic and biotic factors, including light availability, litter depth, and density-dependent interactions with enemies. Whether ontogenetic stage also can play a critical role, however, is seldom considered. We address how early-stage survival of two shade-tolerant species is affected by canopy openness, litter depth, ontogenetic stage, and conspecific neighborhood in the understories of secondary forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored the survival of naturally occurring early-stage individuals of one canopy and one understory tree species in six forest fragments for over 2 yr. We then compared how different abiotic and biotic variables, as well as the initial height of seedlings and the length of time interval, influenced variation in survival using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Survival of the canopy species was negatively affected by light availability, while for the understory species increasing light availability either increased (for seedlings) or decreased (for saplings) survival. In addition, survival of both species at the seedling stage was positively related to litter depth. Finally, we found that conspecific neighbors were an important biotic factor reducing survival. Our results suggest different regeneration niches for these two tree species related to light availability. Moreover, we found that the effect of both abiotic factors depends on ontogenetic stage, a critical factor for understanding regeneration niches in the forest understory.

Resumo

A dinâmica de regeneracao nas florestas tropicais e determinada por muitos fatores abioticos e bioticos, incluindo a luz, a profundidade da serapilheira e interacoes denso-dependentes com inimigos. O estagio ontogenetico, embora tenha um papel critico, raramente e considerado. Nos abordamos a questao de como a sobrevivencia de individuos jovens de duas especies arboreas tolerantes a sombra e afetada pela abertura de dossel, profundidade da serapilheira, estagio ontogenetico e vizinhanca coespecifica no sub-bosque de fragmentos florestais secundarios na Floresta Atlântica brasileira. Monitoramos por cerca de dois anos a sobrevivencia de plântulas e juvenis de duas especies arboreas, uma de sub-bosque e outra de dossel, em seis fragmentos florestais. Em seguida, comparamos como diferentes variaveis abioticas e bioticas, assim como o tamanho inicial das plântulas e o comprimento do intervalo de tempo, influenciavam as variacoes na sobrevivencia, atraves de modelos lineares mistos generalizados. A sobrevivencia da especie de dossel foi afetada negativamente pela disponibilidade de luz, enquanto que para a especie de sub-bosque uma maior disponibilidade de luz tanto aumentou (para as plântulas) quanto diminuiu (para os juvenis) a sobrevivencia. A profundidade da serapilheira teve um efeito positivo na sobrevivencia das plântulas de ambas as especies.

AB  - Kwit, Charles, D.J. Levey and Cathryn H. Greenberg. 2004. Contagious seed dispersal beneath heterospecific fruiting trees and its consequences. Oikos. 107:303-308 A n hypothesized advantage of seed dispersal is avoidance of high per capita mortality (i.e. density-dependent mortality) associated with dense populations of seeds and seedlings beneath parent trees. This hypothesis, inherent in nearly all seed dispersal studies, assumes that density effects are species-specific. Yet because many tree species exhibit overlapping fruiting phenologies and share dispersers, seeds may be deposited preferentially under synchronously fruiting heterospecific trees, another location where they may be particularly vulnerable to mortality, in this case by generalist seed predators. We demonstrate that frugivores disperse higher densities of Cornus florida seeds under fruiting (female) I lex opaca trees than under non-fruiting (male) I lex trees in temperate hardwood forest settings in South Carolina, U SA . To determine if density of Cornus and/or I lex seeds influences survivorship of dispersed Cornus seeds, we followed the fates of experimentally dispersed Cornus seeds in neighborhoods of differing, manipulated background densities of Cornus and I lex seeds. We found that the probability of predation on dispersed Cornus seeds was a function of both Cornus and I lex background seed densities.more » H igher densities of I lex seeds negatively affected Cornus seed survivorship, and this was particularly evident as background densities of dispersed Cornus seeds increased. These results illustrate the importance of viewing seed dispersal and predation in a community context, as the pattern and intensity of density-dependent mortality may not be solely a function of conspecific densities.« less

TI  - Phylogenetic indices and temporal and spatial scales shape the neighborhood effect on seedling survival in a mid-mountain moist evergreen broad-leaved forest, Gaoligong Mountains, Southwestern China.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Density dependence and habitat filtering have been proposed to aid in understanding community assembly and species coexistence. Phylogenetic relatedness between neighbors was used as a proxy for assessing the degree of ecological similarity among species. There are different conclusions regarding the neighborhood effect in previous studies with different phylogenetic indices or at different spatiotemporal scales. However, the effects of density dependence, neighbor phylogenetic relatedness, and habitat filtering on seedling survival with different phylogenetic indices or at different temporal and spatial scales are poorly understood. We monitored 916 seedlings representing 56 woody plant species within a 4-ha forest dynamics plot for 4 years (from 2020 to 2023) in a subtropical mid-mountain moist evergreen broad-leaved forest in the Gaoligong Mountains, Southwestern China. Using generalized linear mixed models, we tested whether and how four phylogenetic indices: total phylogenetic distance (TOTPd), average phylogenetic distance (AVEPd), relative average phylogenetic distance (APd'), and relative nearest taxon phylogenetic distance (NTPd'), three temporals (1, 2, and 3 years), and spatial scales (1, 2, and 4 ha) affect the effect of density dependence, phylogenetic density dependence, and habitat filtering on seedling survival. We found evidence of the effect of phylogenetic density dependence in the 4-ha forest dynamics plot. The effects of density dependence, phylogenetic density dependence, and habitat filtering on seedling survival were influenced by phylogenetic indices and temporal and spatial scales. The effects of phylogenetic density dependence and habitat filtering on seedling survival were more conspicuous only at 1-year intervals, compared with those at 2- and 3-year intervals. We did not detect any effects of neighborhood or habitat factors on seedling survival at small scales (1 and 2 ha), although these effects were more evident at the largest spatial scale (4 ha). These findings highlight that the effects of local neighborhoods and habitats on seedling survival are affected by phylogenetic indices as well as temporal and spatial scales. Our study suggested that phylogenetic index APd', shortest time scale (1 year), and largest spatial scales (4 ha) were suitable for neighborhood studies in a mid-mountain moist evergreen broad-leaved forest in Gaoligong Mountains. Phylogenetic indices and spatiotemporal scales have important impacts on the results of the neighborhood studies.

TI  - Cumulative Effects of Plant‐Animal Interactions on Seed Production by Bauhinia Ungulata, A Neotropical Legume
PY  - 1982
AB  - Seed production was studied in Bauhinia ungulata, a neotropical, perennial legume. Our goals were to identify the biotic factors influencing seed output, the magnitude and variability of their effects, and whether these effects were density dependent. We measured predispersal repro- ductive success in five stands, ranging in size from 18 to 175 ramets. Pollination success and flower herbivory were evaluated for 1375 flowers. Other sources decreasing seed output were observed by examining 1714 seedpods. Six factors led to reduction in potential seed-set. In order of the magnitude of their effects, these factors were lack of pollination, incomplete development of ovules in flowers that formed seedpods, herbivores that damaged flowers that could have been pollinated, bruchids that destroyed developing seeds, herbivores that damaged pistils, and herbivores that ate developing pods. Density dependence was observed for three of the factors: level of pollination success, seed predation, and herbivory on developing seedpods. There was significant variation among stands for the six factors that were measured in all stands. Key factor analysis was used to estimate the influence of these factors on variation among stands in seed-set. Seed predators and pollinators accounted for most of the observed variation. We conclude that pollinators and predators on seeds are potentially important to the population dynamics of this plant.

TI  - Testing predictions of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis: a meta‐analysis of experimental evidence for distance‐ and density‐dependent seed and seedling survival
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary 1. The Janzen–Connell hypothesis proposes that specialist natural enemies, such as herbivores and pathogens, maintain diversity in plant communities by reducing survival rates of conspecific seeds and seedlings located close to reproductive adults or in areas of high conspecific density. Variation in the strength of distance- and density-dependent effects is hypothesized to explain variation in plant species richness along climatic gradients, with effects predicted to be stronger in the tropics than the temperate zone and in wetter habitats compared to drier habitats. 2. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify peer-reviewed experimental studies published in the 40+ years since the hypothesis was first proposed. Using data from these studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the current weight of evidence for the distance and density predictions of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis. 3. Overall, we found significant support for both the distance- and density-dependent predictions. For all studies combined, survival rates were significantly reduced near conspecifics compared to far from conspecifics, and in areas with high densities of conspecifics compared to areas with low conspecific densities. There was no indication that these results were due to publication bias. 4. The strength of distance and density effects varied widely among studies. Contrary to expectations, this variation was unrelated to latitude, and there was no significant effect of study region. However, we did find a trend for stronger distance and density dependence in wetter sites compared to sites with lower annual precipitation. In addition, effects were significantly stronger at the seedling stage compared to the seed stage. 5. Synthesis. Our study provides support for the idea that distance- and density-dependent mortality occurs in plant communities world-wide. Available evidence suggests that natural enemies are frequently the cause of such patterns, consistent with the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, but additional studies are needed to rule out other mechanisms (e.g. intraspecific competition). With the widespread existence of density and distance dependence clearly established, future research should focus on assessing the degree to which these effects permit species coexistence and contribute to the maintenance of diversity in plant communities.

TI  - Spatial distribution and interspecific associations of tree species in a tropical seasonal rain forest of China.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Studying the spatial pattern and interspecific associations of plant species may provide valuable insights into processes and mechanisms that maintain species coexistence. Point pattern analysis was used to analyze the spatial distribution patterns of twenty dominant tree species, their interspecific spatial associations and changes across life stages in a 20-ha permanent plot of seasonal tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, China, to test mechanisms maintaining species coexistence. Torus-translation tests were used to quantify positive or negative associations of the species to topographic habitats. The results showed: (1) fourteen of the twenty tree species were negatively (or positively) associated with one or two of the topographic variables, which evidences that the niche contributes to the spatial pattern of these species. (2) Most saplings of the study species showed a significantly clumped distribution at small scales (0–10 m) which was lost at larger scales (10–30 m). (3) The degree of spatial clumping deceases from saplings, to poles, to adults indicates that density-dependent mortality of the offspring is ubiquitous in species. (4) It is notable that a high number of positive small-scale interactions were found among the twenty species. For saplings, 42.6% of all combinations of species pairs showed positive associations at neighborhood scales up to five meters, but only 38.4% were negative. For poles and adults, positive associations at these distances still made up 45.5% and 29.5%, respectively. In conclusion, there is considerable evidence for the presence of positive interactions among the tree species, which suggests that species herd protection may occur in our plot. In addition, niche assembly and limited dispersal (likely) contribute to the spatial patterns of tree species in the tropical seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, China.

TI  - Conspecific negative density dependence and why its study should not be abandoned
PY  - 2021
AB  - Recent studies showing bias in the measurement of density dependence have the potential to sow confusion in the field of ecology. We provide clarity by elucidating key conceptual and statistical errors with the null-model approach used in Detto et al. (2019). We show that neither their null model nor a more biologically-appropriate null model reproduces differences in density-dependent recruitment between forests, indicating that the latitudinal gradient in negative density dependence is not an artefact of statistical bias. Finally, we suggest a path forward that combines observational comparisons of density dependence in multiple fitness components across localities with mechanistic and geographically-replicated experiments.

TI  - Trees species' dispersal mode and habitat heterogeneity shape negative density dependence in a temperate forest
PY  - 2023
AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is a potentially important mechanism in maintaining species diversity. While previous evidence showed habitat heterogeneity and species’ dispersal modes affect the strength of CNDD at early life stages of trees (e.g., seedlings), it remains unclear how they affect the strength of CNDD at later life stages. We examined the degree of spatial aggregation between saplings and trees for species dispersed by wind and gravity in four topographic habitats within a 25-ha temperate forest dynamic plot in the Qinling Mountains of central China. We used the replicated spatial point pattern (RSPP) analysis and bivariate pair-correlation function (PCF) to detect the spatial distribution of saplings around trees at two scales, 15 m and 50 m, respectively. Although the signal was not apparent across the whole study region (or 25-ha), but on isolated areas with specific characteristics, suggesting that these characteristics could be important factors in CNDD. Further, we found that the gravity-dispersed tree species experienced CNDD across habitats, but for wind-dispersed species CNDD found in gully, terrace and low-ridge habitats. We found that habitat heterogeneity and dispersal mode distort the signal of CNDD and community assembly in temperate forests.

TI  - Mycorrhizal type influences plant density dependence and species richness across 15 temperate forests.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Recent studies suggest that the mycorrhizal type associated with tree species is an important trait influencing ecological processes such as response to environmental conditions and conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). However, we lack a general understanding of how tree mycorrhizal type influences CNDD strength and the resulting patterns of species abundance and richness at larger spatial scales. We assessed 305 species across 15 large, stem-mapped, temperate forest dynamics plots in Northeastern China and North America to explore the relationships between tree mycorrhizal type and CNDD, species abundance, and species richness at a regional scale. Tree species associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi showed a stronger CNDD and a more positive relationship with species abundance than did tree species associated with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. For each plot, both basal area and stem abundance of AM tree species was lower than that of ECM tree species, suggesting that AM tree species were rarer than ECM tree species. Finally, ECM tree dominance showed a negative effect on plant richness across plots. These results provide evidence that tree mycorrhizal type plays an important role in influencing CNDD and species richness, highlighting this trait as an important factor in structuring plant communities in temperate forests.

TI  - Herbivores on a dominant understory shrub increase local plant diversity in rain forest communities
PY  - 2010
AB  - Indirect effects of trophic interactions on biodiversity can be large and common, even in complex communities. Previous experiments with dominant understory Piper shrubs in a Costa Rican rain forest revealed that increases in herbivore densities on these shrubs caused widespread seedling mortality as a result of herbivores moving from Piper to seedlings of many different plant genera. We tested components of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis by conducting focused studies on the effects of specialist and generalist Piper herbivores on local seedling diversity. Whereas specialist herbivores are predicted to increase mortality to neighboring seedlings that are closely related to the source plant, true generalists moving from source plants may cause density-dependent mortality of many species, and possibly increase richness if new species replace abundant species that have been thinned by herbivores. Therefore, we hypothesized that seedling richness would be greater in understory control plots created in patches of Piper that had normal densities of generalist herbivores compared to plots from which we removed generalist herbivores manually from all Piper shrubs. After 15 months, generalist-herbivore-removal plots had >40% fewer seedlings, >40% fewer species, and 40% greater seedling evenness, on average, than control plots with generalist herbivores intact. Using a complementary approach in unmanipulated plots in four forests, we used path analysis to test for a positive association between seedling diversity and herbivore damage on Piper species. In unmanipulated plots, for both generalist and specialist herbivores, our data were significant fits to the causal model that Piper herbivores decrease evenness and increase plant species richness, corroborating the experimental results. Because herbivores changed how individuals were apportioned among the species and families present (lower evenness), one interpretation of these associations between herbivores on Piper shrubs and local seedling richness is that high seedling mortality in dominant families allowed the colonization or survival of less common species. If interspecific or apparent competition allowed for a relative increase in species richness, then the Janzen-Connell hypothesis may extend its predictions to generalist seedling predators. We speculate that apparent competition may explain some of the deviations from neutral model predictions, especially at small scales.

TI  - Seedling survival simultaneously determined by conspecific, heterospecific, and phylogenetically related neighbors and habitat heterogeneity in a subtropical forest in Taiwan.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Density dependence and habitat heterogeneity have been recognized as important driving mechanisms that shape the patterns of seedling survival and promote species coexistence in species-rich forests. In this study, we evaluated the relative importance of density dependence by conspecific, heterospecific, and phylogenetically related neighbors and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival in the Lienhuachih (LHC) Forest, a subtropical, evergreen forest in central Taiwan. Age-specific effects of different variables were also studied. We monitored the fates of 1,642 newly recruited seedlings of woody plants within a 25-ha Forest Dynamics Plot for 2 years. The effects of conspecific, heterospecific, and phylogenetically related neighbors and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival were analyzed by generalized linear mixed models. Our results indicated that conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) had a strong impact on seedling survival, and the effects of CNDD increased with seedling age. Heterospecific positive density dependence (HPDD) and phylogenetic positive density dependence (PPDD) had a significant influence on the survival of seedlings, and stronger HPDD and PPDD effects were detected for older seedlings. Furthermore, seedling survival differed among habitats significantly. Seedling survival was significantly higher in the plateau, high-slope, and low-slope habitats than in the valley. Overall, our results suggested that the effects of CNDD, HPDD, PPDD, and habitat heterogeneity influenced seedling survival simultaneously in the LHC subtropical forest, but their relative importance varied with seedling age. Such findings from our subtropical forest were slightly different from tropical forests, and these contrasting patterns may be attributed to differences in abiotic environments. These findings highlight the importance to incorporate phylogenetic relatedness, seedling age, and habitat heterogeneity when investigating the impacts of density dependence on seedling survival that may contribute to species coexistence in seedling communities.

TI  - Consequences of changing rainfall for fungal pathogen-induced mortality in tropical tree seedlings
PY  - 2012
AB  - Most general circulation models predict that most tropical forests will experience lower and less frequent rainfall in future as a result of climate change, which may reduce the capacity of fungal pathogens to drive density-dependent tree mortality. This is potentially significant because fungal pathogens are thought to play a key role in promoting and structuring plant diversity in tropical forests through the Janzen–Connell mechanism. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drying of tropical forests will negatively impact species coexistence. To test one prediction of this hypothesis, we imposed experimental watering regimes on the seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis, and measured mortality induced by fungal pathogens under shade house conditions. The frequency of watering had a strong impact on survival. Seedlings watered daily experienced significantly higher mortality than those watered every three or every six days, while increasing the volume of water applied also led to increased mortality, although this relationship was less pronounced. These results suggest that the capacity of fungal pathogens to drive density-dependent mortality may be reduced in drier climates and when rainfall is less frequent, with potential implications for the diversity enhancing Janzen–Connell mechanism.

TI  - Mycorrhizas in changing ecosystems1,2
PY  - 2014
AB  - Ecosystems change between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal vegetation dominance over anthropological and geological time scales, yet consequences for ecosystem function are unclear. We review four hypotheses for the effect of mycorrhizal status on ecosystem function. Specifically, that differences between ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal dominated ecosystems are driven by (1) foliar trait differences, (2) positive plant–soil feedback in ectomycorrhizal plants, (3) differences in the ability to dissolve rocks as a source of nutrition, and (4) differences in the ability to use organic nutrients. We find no universal difference in foliar traits with mycorrhizal status. A spatial simulation suggests that positive plant–soil feedback in ectomycorrhizal plants is unlikely to drive ecosystem differences. However, negative feedback appears to be more common in arbuscular mycorrhizal trees than ectomycorrhizal trees and may represent an important ecosystem difference. Rock dissolution occurs un...

TI  - Seedling Survival of Tropical Tree Species: Interactions of Dispersal Distance, Light-Gaps, and Pathogens
PY  - 1984
AB  - This study tested the hypotheses that seed dispersal enhances seedling survival by (1) escape of distance—dependent or density—dependent mortality or both, and (2) colonization of light—gaps. Spatial patterns of seedling survival for 1 yr in shade and in light—gaps and causes of seedling mortality for the first 2 mo were determined for one tree of each of nine species that use wind dispersal on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Dispersal was advantageous to all nine trees, but for different reasons. The colonization hypothesis was supported by all nine trees. At some time interval during the 1st yr, the escape hypothesis was supported by eight of the nine trees; dispersal away from the parent to shaded conditions lowered the probability of seedling mortality. However, the trees differed greatly in (1) when the dispersal advantage became apparent, (2) whether the advantages persisted through time, (3) the distance at which survival was most enhanced, and (4) the strength of the advantage. By 1 yr only four trees showed a moderate to strong advantage of dispersal to shaded areas; two trees showed a very weak advantage, and three trees showed no advantage. Pathogens caused the largest proportion of deaths among shaded seedlings in six of the nine trees. For the two trees with the strongest support for the escape hypothesis, pathogens caused distance— and/or density—dependent mortality; those trees had high seedling densities near the parent. Four other trees had moderate to high mortality by pathogens, irrespective of dispersal distance; those trees had low seedling densities at all distances from the parent. For these six trees in which pathogens were responsible for the largest proportion of deaths in the shade, this mortality was significantly reduced in light—gaps, even though seedlings occurred in high densities. The study indicates that the location where seedlings survive is greatly influenced by pathogen activity. Only the four trees with moderate to strong support for the escape hypothesis had large numbers of seedlings survive to 1 yr in the shade. Seedling recruitment is expected to occur away from the parent tree, in shaded conditions for trees with distance— and/or density—dependent mortality, and in light—gaps for all trees studied here.

TI  - REPRODUCTION IN POLEMONIUM: PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION'
PY  - 1980
AB  - Evidence is presented indicating that the anthomyiid seed predator, Hylemya sp., of Polemonium foliosissimum Gray (Polemoniaceae) preferentially attacks those plants which receive high numbers of pollinator visits. Seed mortality is high in ovaries which set many seeds (i.e., mortality is density-dependent) during the portion of the flowering season when pollinators are limiting re- sources and plants compete for pollinator service. The actions of both the seed predator and the pollinators of P. foliosissimum are responsible, in part, for the observed flowering phenology of this species.

TI  - Are pulp consumers effective seed dispersers? Tests with a large‐seeded tropical relict tree
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Several plant species in the Neotropics bear large, fleshy fruits that suggest adaptation to endozoochorous seed dispersal by large vertebrates. Many of these plants occur in areas where large vertebrates are no longer present; consequently, their seeds are dispersed by pulp consumers; small vertebrates that only ingest the pulp reward because they are uncapable of swallowing the fruits whole. Few studies have examined the role of these pulp consumers on the regeneration of large‐fruited/seeded plants. Here, we assessed seed disperser effectiveness (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">SDE</jats:styled-content>) and context‐dependence in <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">SDE</jats:styled-content> of pulp consumers of <jats:italic>Pouteria splendens</jats:italic>, a large‐seeded tree, considered a tropical relict in Mediterranean Chile. We found that <jats:italic>P. splendens</jats:italic> fruits are consumed by six species of non‐flying vertebrates; four of which act as dispersers with very low effectiveness. Low <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">SDE</jats:styled-content> resulted from the quantitative, rather than the qualitative component, specifically from low visitation rates. Most seeds remained under <jats:italic>P. splendens</jats:italic> trees, either from being dispersed there or because they were not dispersed at all.

TI  - Effects of biotic/abiotic factors on the seedling regeneration of Dacrydium pectinatum formations in tropical montane forests on Hainan Island, China
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Exploring natural regeneration facilitates a better understanding of the mechanisms of community assembly and biodiversity formation. However, convincing data on tree regeneration in threatened tropical plant communities are lacking. Dacrydium pectinatum is a constructive and endangered species in tropical montane forests of Hainan Island. This study aims to identify the seedling regeneration patterns of D. pectinatum formation and their key drivers. A total of 204 seedling plots were investigated in the northwest (Bawangling, 90 plots), southwest (Jianfengling, 90 plots) and southeast (Diaoluoshan, 24 plots) of Hainan Island. We examined the variations in the seedling/adult composition, density and richness along local scales and elevation gradients and analyzed the relationships between biotic/abiotic variables and seedling regeneration. The seedling distribution pattern changed with environmental gradients, and the seedling density and richness decreased from low to high latitudes and from low to high elevations. Additionally, the adult density and total base area also showed consistent trends. At the community and species levels, the biotic neighborhood variables had a primary impact on the seedling density and richness. Multiple environmental factors (such as the canopy density, elevation, slope, soil organic matter, and soil total nitrogen) also showed significant correlations with the seedling density and richness. Our study supports conspecific negative density dependence and niche filtering as the general mechanisms of natural regeneration of D. pectinatum formations. Both biotic and abiotic factors might affect the survival and growth of seedlings, and their relative importance varies with environmental gradients and species. We conclude that enclosing forests with moderate stand densities in low-elevation areas to reduce human interference will help optimize the community structure. However, for high-elevation areas and high-density forests, appropriate thinning, manual regeneration and open gaps are needed to improve the light environment and soil nutrients, thereby promoting the natural regeneration of D. pectinatum formations.

TI  - Strong density- and diversity-related effects help to maintain tree species diversity in a neotropical forest
PY  - 1997
AB  - Intraspecific density-dependent effects in the Barro Colorado Island (Panama) study area are far stronger, and involve far more species, than previously had been suspected. Significant effects on recruitment, many extremely strong, are seen for 67 out of the 84 most common species in the plot, including the 10 most common. Significant effects on the intrinsic rate of increase are seen in 54 of the 84 species. These effects are far more common than interspecific effects, and are predominantly of the type that should maintain tree diversity. As a result, the more diverse an area in the forest is, the higher is the overall rate of increase of the trees in that area, although sheer crowding has by itself a negative effect. These findings are consistent with, but do not prove, an important role for host–pathogen interactions (defined broadly) in the maintenance of diversity. Ways are suggested by which to test host–pathogen models and competing models.

TI  - Positive interactions between herbivores and plant diversity shape forest regeneration
PY  - 2014
AB  - The effects of herbivores and diversity on plant communities have been studied separately but rarely in combination. We conducted two concurrent experiments over 3 years to examine how tree seedling diversity, density and herbivory affected forest regeneration. One experiment factorially manipulated plant diversity (one versus 15 species) and the presence/absence of deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found that mixtures outperformed monocultures only in the presence of deer. Selective browsing on competitive dominants and associational protection from less palatable species appear responsible for this herbivore-driven diversity effect. The other experiment manipulated monospecific plant density and found little evidence for negative density dependence. Combined, these experiments suggest that the higher performance in mixture was owing to the acquisition of positive interspecific interactions rather than the loss of negative intraspecific interactions. Overall, we emphasize that realistic predictions about the consequences of changing biodiversity will require a deeper understanding of the interaction between plant diversity and higher trophic levels. If we had manipulated only plant diversity, we would have missed an important positive interaction across trophic levels: diverse seedling communities better resist herbivores, and herbivores help to maintain seedling diversity.

TI  - Seed shadows, survival and recruitment: how simple mechanisms lead to dynamics of population recruitment curves
PY  - 1999
AB  - According to the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, seedling recruitment around tropical trees is more likely away from parent trees because of density- or distance-dependent predation or pathogen attack on seeds and seedlings. This was expected to lead to a more regular distribution of conspecific adults than would be expected by chance, and to favour coexistence. We first show theoretically that, even if yearly survival increases only slightly with distance to parent trees, an outward shift of seedling recruitment curves with time is very likely simply because seedlings live more than one year before recruiting to the juvenile stage. We tested this hypothesis for a humid savanna, dioecious palm tree, Borassus aethiopum, for which three discrete stages were defined by clear morphological traits. We found that (1) individuals of the second seedling stage are found on average further from their mother than individuals of the first seedling stage, and juveniles are found even further away (relative outward shifts between the three successive stages), and that (2) the older a female is, the further away its seedlings are (temporal outward shifts of distributions of seedlings). Both yearly recruitment (transition between two stages) and survival of seedlings are distance dependent and not density dependent. A matrix population model was used to demonstrate that, during the reproductive part of female palm life cycle, the cumulative effects of these distance-dependent variations in yearly recruitment and survival rates are sufficient to explain qualitatively the observed outward shifts.

TI  - Conspecific negative density dependence in American beech
PY  - 2017
AB  - One of the most important drivers of forest biodiversity is conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), a reduction in performance when conspecific densities are high. While the majority of CNDD research has focused on tropical forests, evidence is mounting that CNDD may also play an important role in temperate forests. To further explore the potential reach of this phenomenon, we investigated CNDD in American beech (Fagus grandifolia) in a mature mid-Atlantic forest. We used bivariate point pattern analyses to examine spatial relationships between large beech trees and conspecific saplings, and we also contrasted these patterns with comparable patterns for heterospecifics. In addition, to address the possibility of dispersal limitation and the associated effects on spatial patterns, we analyzed seedling density as a function of adult conspecific abundance. We found that beech saplings were more repelled from large conspecifics than large heterospecifics, despite the fact that beech seedling density was positively correlated with beech basal area. However, saplings of other canopy tree species were also repelled from adult beech trees, suggesting a general suppressive effect. Nonetheless, the discrepancy between beech seedling and sapling densities beneath adult conspecifics suggests that beech seedling survival rates were reduced in vicinity of conspecific adults. Regardless of the extent to which beech inhibits heterospecific trees, a negative effect on conspecific recruits may be critical for biodiversity maintenance. Without this conspecific suppression, a dense layer of shade-tolerant beech saplings could form beneath adult beech trees. If this were to occur, beech would have a substantial head-start following canopy disturbance, and this late-successional species could potentially dominate a stand in perpetuity, through repeated disturbance cycles.

TI  - Density-dependent settlement and mortality structure the earliest life phases of a coral population.
PY  - 2008
AB  - The local densities of heterospecifics and conspecifics are known to have profound effects on the dynamics of many benthic species, including rates of settlement and early post-settlement survivorship. We described the early life history of the Caribbean coral, Siderastrea radians by tracking the population dynamics from recently settled planulae to juveniles. Through three years of observation, settlement correlated with the abundance of other benthic organisms, principally turf algae (negatively) and crustose coralline algae (positively). In addition, adult density showed independent effects on coral settlement and early post-settlement survivorship. Settlement rates increased across low levels of adult cover and saturated at a maximum around 10% cover. Early post-settlement survivorship decreased with adult cover, revealing structuring density dependence in coral settlers. The earliest life stages of corals are defined by low survivorship, with survivorship increasing appreciably with colony size. However, recent settlers (one-polyp individuals, 1 year old) that were delayed in their development. The early benthic phase of corals is defined by a severe demographic bottleneck for S. radians, with appreciable density-dependent and density-independent effects on survivorship. For effective management and restoration of globally imperiled coral reefs, we must focus more attention on this little studied, but dynamic, early life history period of corals.

TI  - Pathogens and insect herbivores drive rainforest plant diversity and composition
PY  - 2014
AB  - Tropical forests are important reservoirs of biodiversity, but the processes that maintain this diversity remain poorly understood. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis suggests that specialized natural enemies such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens maintain high diversity by elevating mortality when plant species occur at high density (negative density dependence; NDD). NDD has been detected widely in tropical forests, but the prediction that NDD caused by insects and pathogens has a community-wide role in maintaining tropical plant diversity remains untested. We show experimentally that changes in plant diversity and species composition are caused by fungal pathogens and insect herbivores. Effective plant species richness increased across the seed-to-seedling transition, corresponding to large changes in species composition. Treating seeds and young seedlings with fungicides significantly reduced the diversity of the seedling assemblage, consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Although suppressing insect herbivores using insecticides did not alter species diversity, it greatly increased seedling recruitment and caused a marked shift in seedling species composition. Overall, seedling recruitment was significantly reduced at high conspecific seed densities and this NDD was greatest for the species that were most abundant as seeds. Suppressing fungi reduced the negative effects of density on recruitment, confirming that the diversity-enhancing effect of fungi is mediated by NDD. Our study provides an overall test of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and demonstrates the crucial role that insects and pathogens have both in structuring tropical plant communities and in maintaining their remarkable diversity.

TI  - Pervasive within-species spatial repulsion among adult tropical trees.
PY  - 2023
AB  - For species to coexist, performance must decline as the density of conspecific individuals increases. Although evidence for such conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) exists in forests, the within-species spatial repulsion it should produce has rarely been demonstrated in adults. In this study, we show that in comparison to a null model of stochastic birth, death, and limited dispersal, the adults of dozens of tropical forest tree species show strong spatial repulsion, some to surprising distances of approximately 100 meters. We used simulations to show that such strong repulsion can only occur if CNDD considerably exceeds heterospecific negative density dependence-an even stronger condition required for coexistence-and that large-scale repulsion can indeed result from small-scale CNDD. These results demonstrate substantial niche differences between species that may stabilize species diversity.

TI  - Pathogens, density dependence and the coexistence of tropical trees
PY  - 2006
AB  - There is increasing interest in the role played by density-dependent mortality from natural enemies, particularly plant pathogens, in promoting the coexistence and diversity of tropical trees. Here, we review four issues in the analysis of pathogen-induced density dependence that have been overlooked or inadequately addressed. First, the methodology for detecting density dependence must be robust to potential biases. Observational studies, in particular, require a careful analysis to avoid biases generated by measurement error, and existing studies could be criticized on these grounds. Experimental studies manipulating plant density and pathogen incidence will often be preferable, or should be run in parallel. Second, the form of density dependence is not well understood and, in particular, there are no data indicating whether pathogens cause compensating or overcompensating density responses. Owing to this, we argue that the potential for pathogen-induced density dependence to generate diversity-enhancing outcomes, such as the Janzen–Connell effect, remains uncertain, as coexistence is far more probable if density dependence is overcompensating. Third, there have been few studies examining the relative importance of intra- or interspecific density dependence resulting from pathogens (or, more widely, natural enemies). This is essentially equivalent to asking to what extent pathogens are host-specific. If pathogens are generalists, then mortality rates will respond to overall plant density, irrespective of plant species identity. This will weaken the intraspecific density dependence and reduce the diversity-promoting effects of pathogens. Finally, we highlight the need for studies that integrate observations and experiments on pathogens and density dependence into the whole life cycle of trees, because as yet it is not possible to be certain of the degree to which pathogens contribute to observed dynamics.

TI  - An invasive plant rapidly increased the similarity of soil fungal pathogen communities
PY  - 2020
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS Plant invasions can change soil microbial communities and affect subsequent invasions directly or indirectly via foliar herbivory. It has been proposed that invaders promote uniform biotic communities that displace diverse, spatially variable communities (the biotic homogenization hypothesis), but this has not been experimentally tested for soil microbial communities, so the underlying mechanisms and dynamics are unclear. Here, we compared density-dependent impacts of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener A. sessilis on soil fungal communities, and their feedback effects on plants and a foliar beetle. METHODS We conducted a plant-soil feedback (PSF) experiment and a laboratory bioassay to examine PSFs associated with the native and invasive plants and a beetle feeding on them. We also characterized the soil fungal community using high-throughput sequencing. KEY RESULTS We found locally differentiated soil fungal pathogen assemblages associated with high densities of the native plant A. sessilis but little variation in those associated with the invasive congener A. philoxeroides, regardless of plant density. In contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal assemblages associated with high densities of the invasive plant were more variable. Soil biota decreased plant shoot mass but their effect was weak for the invasive plant growing in native plant-conditioned soils. PSFs increased the larval biomass of a beetle reared on leaves of the native plant only. Moreover, PSFs on plant shoot and root mass and beetle mass were predicted by different pathogen taxa in a plant species-specific manner. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that plant invasions can rapidly increase the similarity of soil pathogen assemblages even at low plant densities, leading to taxonomically and functionally homogeneous soil communities that may limit negative soil effects on invasive plants.

TI  - Abiotic niche partitioning and negative density dependence drive tree seedling survival in a tropical forest.
PY  - 2017
AB  - In tropical tree communities, processes occurring during early life stages play a critical role in shaping forest composition and diversity through differences in species9 performance. Predicting the future of tropical forests depends on a solid understanding of the drivers of seedling survival. At the same time, factors determining spatial and temporal patterns of seedling survival can play a large role in permitting species coexistence in diverse communities. Using long-term data on the survival of more than 45 000 seedlings of 238 species in a Neotropical forest, we assessed the relative importance of key abiotic and biotic neighbourhood variables thought to influence individual seedling survival and tested whether species vary significantly in their responses to these variables, consistent with niche differences. At the community level, seedling survival was significantly correlated with plant size, topographic habitat, neighbourhood densities of conspecific seedlings, conspecific and heterospecific trees and annual variation in water availability, in descending order of effect size. Additionally, we found significant variation among species in their sensitivity to light and water availability, as well as in their survival within different topographic habitats, indicating the potential for niche differentiation among species that could allow for species coexistence.

TI  - Janzen–Connell effects partially supported in reef-building corals: adult presence interacts with settler density to limit establishment
PY  - 2021
AB  - In many plant and sessile marine invertebrate (SMI) taxa, population and community dynamics are heavily influenced by processes occurring during the dispersal and establishment phases. The Janzen–Connell (J–C) hypothesis predicts increased survival of early life stages with decreasing conspecific density and increased distance from conspecific adults. Evidence of J–C effects in maintaining diversity is common in plant communities, but its importance in SMI communities remains unclear. Under controlled aquarium conditions, we examined the effect of density-dependence and adult conspecific water treatments (absent/present) on propagule settlement success and settler post-settlement survival, along with associated spatial patterns, for six broadcast-spawning, reef-building coral species from three families. We also tested if settlement success was linked to increasing propagule species diversity for three coral species from two families. We found that the probability of settlement was density independent and not influenced by adult present water treatments. Yet, adult present water treatments and settler density did have a synergistic negative effect on the probability of short-term settler survival for all species examined. Settlers also showed greater spatial aggregation as their numbers increased, but were less aggregated in adult present water treatments compared to those in adult absent water treatments. We further show evidence of significant species interactions among propagules, as settlement in single-species trials was four-fold higher compared to mixed-species trials. Our findings from controlled experimental arenas indicate that the early establishment of corals was predominantly limited by density-dependent settler–adult interactions among conspecifics and propagule–propagule interactions among heterospecifics. Thus, the proximity to established conspecific adults, settler density and species diversity of propagules are relevant drivers of local coral community diversity and structure. Based on these outcomes, we suggest that the J–C hypothesis, with demonstrated importance for plants, is partially upheld for reef corals.

TI  - Interactions between repeated fire, nutrients, and insect herbivores affect the recovery of diversity in the southern Amazon
PY  - 2012
AB  - Surface fires burn extensive areas of tropical forests each year, altering resource availability, biotic interactions, and, ultimately, plant diversity. In transitional forest between the Brazilian cerrado (savanna) and high stature Amazon forest, we took advantage of a long-term fire experiment to establish a factorial study of the interactions between fire, nutrient availability, and herbivory on early plant regeneration. Overall, five annual burns reduced the number and diversity of regenerating stems. Community composition changed substantially after repeated fires, and species common in the cerrado became more abundant. The number of recruits and their diversity were reduced in the burned area, but burned plots closed to herbivores with nitrogen additions had a 14 % increase in recruitment. Diversity of recruits also increased up to 50 % in burned plots when nitrogen was added. Phosphorus additions were related to an increase in species evenness in burned plots open to herbivores. Herbivory reduced seedling survival overall and increased diversity in burned plots when nutrients were added. This last result supports our hypothesis that positive relationships between herbivore presence and diversity would be strongest in treatments that favor herbivory--in this case herbivory was higher in burned plots which were initially lower in diversity. Regenerating seedlings in less diverse plots were likely more apparent to herbivores, enabling increased herbivory and a stronger signal of negative density dependence. In contrast, herbivores generally decreased diversity in more species rich unburned plots. Although this study documents complex interactions between repeated burns, nutrients, and herbivory, it is clear that fire initiates a shift in the factors that are most important in determining the diversity and number of recruits. This change may have long-lasting effects as the forest progresses through succession.

TI  - Density dependence is prevalent in a heterogeneous subtropical forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Although negative conspecific density dependence among neighbours is widely studied, the general prevalence of the effects is still poorly understood due to a lack of studies from zonal forests other than the tropics. In addition, the detection of density dependence may be confounded by the influence of habitat heterogeneity. Here we examined the spatial distributions of 47 common tree species (diameter at breast height ≥ 1 cm) using the pair-correlation function g(r) in a fully mapped 24-ha subtropical forest in China. We first investigated whether habitat heterogeneity influenced tree distributions, and then examined the conspecific tree patterns and density dependence after removing the effects of habitat heterogeneity. We found that the forest plot exhibited strong large-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of both large adult trees of different growth forms and individual species. After the habitat heterogeneity was accounted for, 39 of the 47 species (83.0%) were found to exhibit density dependence predominantly at close distances among neighbors. Our findings highlight density dependence as a prevalent mechanism for regulating the population spatial structure of most tree species in the species-rich subtropical forest studied here. Furthermore, the occurrence of density dependence is closely associated with species abundance and the strength of conspecific aggregation at local scales. Abundant species with high strength of conspecific aggregation tend to show density dependence.

TI  - When do Janzen-Connell effects matter? A phylogenetic meta-analysis of conspecific negative distance and density dependence experiments.
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Janzen-Connell (J-C) hypothesis suggests that specialised natural enemies cause distance- or density-dependent mortality among host plants and is regarded as an important mechanism for species coexistence. However, there remains debate about whether this phenomenon is widespread and how variation is structured across taxa and life stages. We performed the largest meta-analysis of experimental studies conducted under natural settings to date. We found little evidence of distance-dependent or density-dependent mortality when grouping all types of manipulations. Our analysis also reveals very large variation in response among species, with 38.5% of species even showing positive responses to manipulations. However, we found a strong signal of distance-dependent mortality among seedlings but not seed experiments, which we attribute to (a) seedlings sharing susceptible tissues with adults (leaves, wood, roots), (b) seedling enemies having worse dispersal than seed enemies and (c) seedlings having fewer physical and chemical defences than seeds. Both density- and distance-dependent mortality showed large variation within genera and families, suggesting that J-C effects are not strongly phylogenetically conserved. There were no clear trends with latitude, rainfall or study duration. We conclude that J-C effects may not be as pervasive as widely thought. Understanding the variation in J-C effects provides opportunities for new discoveries that will refine our understanding of J-C effects and its role in species coexistence.

TI  - Keystone and intraguild predation, intraspecific density dependence, and a guild of coexisting consumers.
PY  - 2013
AB  - AbstractPrevious models of diamond-shaped and intraguild predation community modules have represented the essence of the trade-off necessary for a top predator to prevent competitive exclusion among a set of resource-limited consumers. However, at most two consumers can coexist in these models. In this article, I show how intraspecific density dependence in the consumers can permit many more than two consumers to coexist in these community modules. Moreover, responses of the community to removal of the top predator depend on the patterns of the strengths of species interactions relative to the strengths of intraspecific density dependence. If the consumers experience similar strengths of intraspecific density dependence, removing the top predator will in most cases have little effect on consumer species richness. A substantial reduction in consumer species richness with predator removal (i.e., the keystone predation effect) will typically occur only when the consumer that can support a population at the l...

TI  - Mechanisms influencing the coexistence of multiple consumers and multiple resources: resource and apparent competition
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Interactions among multiple resources and consumers involve two indirect interactions: resource competition among consumers and apparent competition among resources. However, competition among multiple consumers is typically viewed through the lens of direct interactions embodied in the Lotka‐Volterra competition model, which fails to capture the mechanisms of these indirect interactions. In this paper, I analyze various elaborations of MacArthur's and Tilman's original consumer–resource models including more than two species per trophic level, saturating functional responses, and direct intraspecific density dependence within the consumers. First, the simplest model with two resources and two consumers with linear functional responses is analyzed via the structure of the resulting isoclines, and this is reconciled with Tilman's graphical <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">ZNGI</jats:styled-content>/consumption vector approach. With three species at each trophic level even in this simple model, each consumer is not required to have the largest impact on the resource that most limits its growth for multiple consumers to coexist. In fact, a consumer that is an inferior competitor on each resource in isolation may still coexist with superior competitors, and conversely a consumer that is an inferior competitor on each available resource may still be able to drive all other consumers extinct. However, the maximum number of coexisting consumers is set by the number of available resources. Saturating functional responses do not qualitatively alter the conditions for multiple consumers and resources to coexist at a stable point equilibrium but do increase the range of apparent competitive abilities for resources that can invade and coexist. Saturating functional responses also increase the range of dynamics that the community may display (i.e., limit cycles and chaos), which previous analyses have shown can permit more consumer species than resources to coexist. Adding direct intraspecific density dependence in the consumers, either in the form of feeding interference or density‐dependent demographic rates, permit more consumers to coexist than available resources, even at stable point equilibria. Understanding the indirect effects that cascade through a community is essential to predicting community changes and understanding how species at multiple trophic levels coexist, and these indirect effects should not be shrouded behind the curtain of Lotka‐Volterra competition.</jats:p>

TI  - Conspecific density plays a pivotal role in shaping sapling community in highly fragmented subtropical forests
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical and subtropical regions shelter high levels of biodiversity. A combination of biological, environmental and anthropogenic factors influences tree community diversity and composition. Here, we use data from the IFFSC project to test the effect of conspecific and heterospecific density dependence, canopy cover and distance to edge on saplings populations of 229 woody species in 159 plots distributed across three forest types in Southern Brazil. All plots were measured twice with a standardized time interval of 5 years. We fitted one ordinary least square regression model to each species to test the strength of each predictor on the species' population growth rate, and one global mixed effect model including forest type, ecological group and the interaction between distance to edge and conspecific density to test their impact in the overall trend of the species. Our analysis provided circumstantial evidence that conspecific density dependence is shaping diversity of forest fragments. This mechanism was present for 75.5% of the species, while heterospecific density affected 10% of the species. Canopy cover affected the population dynamics of 9.2% of the species and distance to edge affected 7.4% of the species. Forest type had a significant effect in the global model, suggesting that population dynamics differ between different forest formations. Ecological group was not significant in the global model suggesting that the mechanism affects species similarly despite their ecological group. The interaction between distance to edge and conspecific density was significant in the global model, suggesting that this mechanism differs between interior and edge of fragments. This work represents one of the few large‐scale analyses of conspecific density dependence in fragmented secondary forests. Our results show that, once the forest is stablished, conspecific density dependence is crucial in sapling population dynamics, despite high levels of fragmentation.</jats:p>

TI  - MONKEY DISPERSAL AND WASTE OF A NEOTROPICAL FRUIT
PY  - 1980
AB  - Foraging birds and mammals were observed at a Panamanian rain forest tree Tetra- gastris panamensis (Burseraceae) in order to determine (1) relative importance of different dispersal agents and (2) the relationship between fruit production and dispersal. The system is of interest because fruits provide little but sugar, fruits are not depleted by animals (i.e., are superabundant), and the tree is visited by a variety of vertebrates with different effects on seed dissemination. Three mammals (Alouatta palliata, Cebus capucinus, Nasua narica) account for 97% of all seeds removed from the trees; the howler monkey (Alouatta) is alone responsible for 74% of the seeds removed. Seeds from the feces of these mammals are fully viable. In addition, two diurnal mammals, three nocturnal mammals, and nine birds ingest and disperse small numbers of seeds, but these species are numerically insignificant. Two parrots (Amazona farinosa and A. autumnalis) are im- portant fruit thieves and seed predators, while three mammals and three additional birds kill or drop small numbers of seeds near the parent trees. Assemblage richness increases markedly with crop size, but most of 25 visitors are of little significance to the plant. Use by three monkeys closely reflects their relative abundance; the abundance of the coatimundi (Nasua) is unknown. This system is characterized by enormous seed waste. Of >430,000 seeds produced by 19 study trees in 1978, <4% had even a remote chance of establishment. The remainder were killed by parrots (6%), were dropped or spontaneously fell under parent trees (66%), or were doomed to intense competition in fecal clumps (24%). The three primary dispersal agents indirectly caused most seed and seedling mortality by dropping seeds under the tree crown or leaving them in fecal clumps, precluding survival of any but a small fraction of seedlings. Crop size ranged from 165 to 100,000 arillate seeds per season, but fruits appeared superabundant on all trees. Numbers of seeds dispersed increased dramatically with crop size, but the proportion dispersed was highest at plants with crops of intermediate size. The proportion of seeds killed by parrots increased with crop size. Dispropor- tionate mortality of seedlings in high densities near adult trees indicated density-dependent mortality among juveniles. Wide geographical ranges of this tree and members of the frugivore assemblage, use of other food resources by common foragers, richness of the assemblage, variation in species visitation at individual trees, irregular annual fruit production, and obvious "inefficiency" of the dominant dispersal agents from the perspective of the plant suggest that Tetragastris has a generalized dispersal strategy and is not closely coevolved with particular frugivores. A generalized dispersal system is expected from a tree, such as this one, that produces sugary fruit incapable of providing a balanced diet.

TI  - Multispecies Coexistence without Diffuse Competition; or, Why Phylogenetic Signal and Trait Clustering Weaken Coexistence.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Related and phenotypically similar species often compete more strongly than unrelated and dissimilar species. Much is unknown about the community-level implications of such complex interactions. Here, we study how they affect community dynamics differently from diffuse interactions (competing equally with all heterospecifics). We derive results for a model that applies to many forms of density dependence and also examine specific cases using a site-occupancy model of forest dynamics. The results indicate that nondiffuse competition produces three effects that will not occur under diffuse competition: first, the central niche effect-if a species has high niche overlap with several competitors, then its average fitness is reduced; second, the common competitor effect-if a species has high niche overlap with more common species, then its average fitness is reduced (these two effects are usually equalizing, because more favorable niches are likely to contain more species and more abundant species); and, finally, the community redistribution effect-when a species falls to low density, the relative abundance of its competitors will change, altering its ability to recover. The community redistribution effect usually undermines coexistence, because the community will usually become dominated by an invader's closest competitors. This study provides both instructions for measuring these effects in the field and a framework for analyzing how phylogenetic signal, trait-based niche axes, and other forms of nondiffuse competition affect coexistence.

TI  - Fungi and insects compensate for lost vertebrate seed predation in an experimentally defaunated tropical forest.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Overhunting reduces important plant-animal interactions such as vertebrate seed dispersal and seed predation, thereby altering plant regeneration and even above-ground biomass. It remains unclear, however, if non-hunted species can compensate for lost vertebrates in defaunated ecosystems. We use a nested exclusion experiment to isolate the effects of different seed enemies in a Bornean rainforest. In four of five tree species, vertebrates kill many seeds (13-66%). Nonetheless, when large mammals are excluded, seed mortality from insects and fungi fully compensates for the lost vertebrate predation, such that defaunation has no effect on seedling establishment. The switch from seed predation by generalist vertebrates to specialist insects and fungi in defaunated systems may alter Janzen-Connell effects and density-dependence in plants. Previous work using simulation models to explore how lost seed dispersal will affect tree species composition and carbon storage may require reevaluation in the context of functional redundancy within complex species interactions networks.

TI  - Asymmetric density dependence shapes species abundances in a tropical tree community.
PY  - 2010
AB  - The factors determining species commonness and rarity are poorly understood, particularly in highly diverse communities. Theory predicts that interactions with neighbors of the same (conspecific) and other (heterospecific) species can influence a species' relative abundance, but empirical tests are lacking. By using a hierarchical model of survival for more than 30,000 seedlings of 180 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we tested whether species' sensitivity to neighboring individuals relates to their relative abundance in the community. We found wide variation among species in the effect of conspecific, but not heterospecific, neighbors on survival, and we found a significant relationship between the strength of conspecific neighbor effects and species abundance. Specifically, rare species suffered more from the presence of conspecific neighbors than common species did, suggesting that conspecific density dependence shapes species abundances in diverse communities.

TI  - Wildfire and drought moderate the spatial elements of tree mortality
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Background tree mortality is a complex process that requires large sample sizes and long timescales to disentangle the suite of ecological factors that collectively contribute to tree stress, decline, and eventual mortality. Tree mortality associated with acute disturbance events, in contrast, is conspicuous and frequently studied, but there remains a lack of research regarding the role of background mortality processes in mediating the severity and delayed effects of disturbance. We conducted an empirical study by measuring the rates, causes, and spatial pattern of mortality annually among 32,989 individual trees within a large forest demography plot in the Sierra Nevada. We characterized the relationships between background mortality, compound disturbances (fire and drought), and forest spatial structure, and we integrated our findings with a synthesis of the existing literature from around the world to develop a conceptual framework describing the spatio‐temporal signatures of background and disturbance‐related tree mortality. The interactive effects of fire, drought, and background mortality processes altered the rate, spatial structuring, and ecological consequences of mortality. Before fire, spatially non‐random mortality was only evident among small (1 &lt; cm DBH ≤ 10)‐ and medium (10 &lt; cm DBH ≤ 60)‐diameter classes; mortality rates were low (1.7% per yr), and mortality was density‐dependent among small‐diameter trees. Direct fire damage caused the greatest number of moralities (70% of stems ≥1 cm DBH), but the more enduring effects of this disturbance on the demography and spatial pattern of large‐diameter trees occurred during the post‐fire mortality regime. The combined effects of disturbance and biotic mortality agents provoked density‐dependent mortality among large‐diameter (≥60 cm DBH) trees, eliciting a distinct post‐disturbance mortality regime that did not resemble the pattern of either pre‐fire mortality or direct fire effects. The disproportionate ecological significance of the largest trees renders this mortality regime acutely consequential to the long‐term structure and function of forests.</jats:p>

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Individual‐level interactions with neighbours and their surrounding environments are key factors influencing performance that ultimately shape and maintain diversity in tropical plant communities. Theory predicts that the strength of these interactions depends on the similarity among neighbours, the turnover in composition caused by individuals that enter as new recruits and individuals that die, and fitting to local conditions.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The results showed that trait dissimilarity associated with resource acquisition does not influence growth. However, conspecific negative density‐dependent effects on growth were evident through the initial density of conspecifics and the increase in conspecifics during the study period.

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Together, these findings indicate that tropical seedling communities are structured by local abiotic factors that ultimately result in individual variation in resource acquisition traits and by biotic interactions driven by negative density dependence. These biotic interactions are highly dynamic and depend on conspecifics turnover, even at short temporal scales. Thus, to gain further insights into the forces structuring seedling communities, future studies should account for temporal variability in immediate neighbours and individual‐level phenotypic variation that influence individual interactions.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Rare plant species are at a disadvantage when both herbivory and pollination interactions are considered in an alpine meadow
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rare plant species often suffer less damage than common species because of positive density-dependent herbivory, and it has been suggested that this 'rare species advantage' fosters plant species coexistence. However, it is unknown whether rare species have an advantage when pollination interactions are also considered. We hypothesized that a 'positive density-dependent pollination success' across plant species would result in common plants experiencing higher seed set rates compared to rare species, and that positive density-dependent effects would negate or even override the positive density-dependent damage due to herbivory resulting in higher seed loss rates in common plant species. We tested this hypothesis by concurrently examining a plant-predispersal seed predator system and a plant-pollinator system for 24 Asteraceae species growing in an alpine meadow community (Sichuan Province, China). Having previously reported a positive density-dependent effect on seed loss rates due to seed predators, we here focus on the density-dependent effects on pollination success by investigating pollinator species richness, visitation frequencies and seed set rates for each plant species. We also estimated the seed output rate of each plant species as the product of seed set rate and the rate of surviving seeds (i.e. 1 - the seed loss rate). Consistent with our hypothesis, a positive density-dependent effect was observed for pollinator species richness, visitation frequencies and seed set rates across plant species. Moreover, the positive effect overrode the negative density-dependent effect of herbivores on seed production, such that common species tended to have a higher seed output rate than rare species (i.e. we observed a 'rare species disadvantage'). These results indicate that the low seed output rate of rare species might result from a pollination limitation, and that both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions should be examined simultaneously to fully understand plant species coexistence in local communities.

TI  - Discordance in spatial patterns of white pine (Pinus strobus) size‐classes in a patchy near‐boreal forest
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary


1
White pines (Pinus strobus) in a c. 1 ha near-boreal aspen-red maple stand in the western Great Lakes region, USA, were allocated to five size-classes that were tested for discordance of their spatial patterns (i.e. within-size-class spatial distribution of individuals and spatial associations among different size-classes). The size-classes were 0.5–1 m tall, 1–2 m tall, 2–4 m tall, > 4 m tall but  20 cm d.b.h. The size-classes also differed in age. Their spatial patterns were analysed using formulae for spatial autocorrelation with categorical data at neighbourhood (0–14 m) and stand (0–70 m) scales.

2
Size-classes clustered in neighbourhoods that differed in size ranging from 6 m in diameter (size-class 2) to 40 m (size-class 3), suggesting that the pattern of each size-class is due to a different set of environmental factors. Similar size-classes tended to be randomly or positively associated at neighbourhood scales, while the most dissimilar size-classes occupied different neighbourhoods.

3
Size-classes 1 and 2 were located farther away from seed trees than size-class 3, which was farther away than size-class 4. Thus periodic seedling invasion of a deciduous matrix may be followed by the gradual retraction of older size-classes into a refuge near the mature seed source where competition from shrubs and overstorey trees is lower. Although the lack of fine-scale clustering suggests density-dependent mortality within the refuge, few older individuals were found outside this area.

4
Two regeneration bottlenecks may structure white pine populations. First, recruitment into size-class 2 is restricted to small patches (possibly in understorey gaps) within neighbourhoods with abundant size-class 1. Relatively unrestricted recruitment to size-class 3 follows, and after that recruitment to size-class 4 is again limited, this time to refugia with sparse canopy near adult trees.

TI  - Functional determinants of forest recruitment over broad scales
PY  - 2014
AB  - Aim

The drivers of tree recruitment over large spatial scales remain unexplored. Here, we ask whether species potential for recruitment and the strength of density-dependent processes, both inferred from species relative abundances, show emerging patterns that can be explained upon the basis of information about climate and functional traits.



Location

Eastern forests of the USA.



Methods

We document the geographical distributions and magnitudes of seedling recruitment and the strength of density dependence and conspecific density dependence for the forests of the eastern USA spanning > 1.2 million km2 across 88,854 local communities comprising 164 tree species. We also compiled climatic variables and 16 traits representing several important ecological axes of tree functional strategies to assess which factors were most strongly associated with the emerging broad-scale spatial patterns.



Results

Strong geographical variation in the potential for seedling recruitment and a latitudinal change from negative to positive density dependence moving northward were associated with adaptation to seasonal freezing temperatures and seed size. Wood density and leaf nitrogen, in contrast, were related to the magnitude of the negative density dependence and conspecific density dependence, respectively, which were prevalent over most of the region.



Main conclusions

Our results provide strong evidence that tree recruitment and the strength of density-dependent processes have broad-scale patterns that can be explained by a few key species functional traits.

TI  - Testing for enemy‐mediated density‐dependence in the mortality of seedlings: field experiments with five Neotropical tree species
PY  - 2013
AB  - Th e coexistence of plant species in species-rich tropical forests can be promoted by specialised enemies acting in a negatively density-dependent manner. While survival of tropical tree seedlings is often negatively density-dependent, the causes have rarely been identifi ed. We tested whether insects and plant pathogens cause density-dependent seedling recruitment and survival in fi ve forest tree species in Belize, Central America. We manipulated densities of seeds or newly germinated seedlings in small (1 m 2 or 0.25 m 2 ) plots close to fruiting conspecifi c trees. Using a factorial design, we excluded enemies from subsets of the plots with fungicides and insecticides. Seed germination (for two species) and early seedling survival (for all species) were monitored at approximately weekly intervals for up to eight weeks, during the period when plants are likely to be most susceptible to natural enemies. In Terminalia amazonia, seed germination was negatively density-dependent and the proportion of seeds germinating increased when insects were excluded. However, the magnitude of the insecticide eff ect was independent of density. Th e only signifi cant density eff ect for survival of young seedlings was in Acacia polyphylla ; counter to expectation, seedling survival was higher at high densities. In a few cases pesticide application had a signifi cant

TI  - The full path of Janzen-Connell effects: genetic tracking of seeds to adult plant recruitment.
PY  - 2011
AB  - The Janzen-Connell (J-C) model (Janzen 1970; Connell 1971) has been a dominant yet controversial paradigm for forest community dynamics for four decades, especially in the tropics. With increasing distance from the parent plant, the density of dispersed seeds decreases and, because of a reduced impact of distance- and density-responsive seed and seedling enemies, propagule survival increases, resulting in peak recruitment at some distance from the parent and little recruitment near adult conspecifics. This spacing generates gaps near adult trees for the recruitment of heterospecifics, enhancing species coexistence and species richness. Field studies, primarily focused on seeds and young seedlings, have repeatedly demonstrated increasing survival with increasing distance from parents or decreasing density of propagules (e.g. Clark & Clark 1984; Gilbert et al. 1994; Swamy & Terborgh 2010). Yet a meta-analysis of distance-dependent propagule survival failed to support a general pattern of survival increasing with distance from adult conspecifics, suggesting that there is no need for further experimental tests of the J-C hypothesis in terms of diversity enhancement-results are species-specific, not general (Hyatt et al. 2003). However, a lack of consistent experimental results is not surprising. The outcome of tests of the hypothesis can vary as a function of many factors that can affect successive recruitment stages differently (Schupp 1992; Hyatt et al. 2003; Swamy & Terborgh 2010). This highlights a critical gap-a full test of the J-C model requires data demonstrating that effects carry over to recruitment of new reproductive adults, yet few studies have gone beyond early stages. There is strong inferential evidence that adult trees can show the imprint of J-C effects (e.g. Nathan et al. 2000; Howe & Miriti 2004), and focal individual modelling has clearly demonstrated that J-C effects can operate from sapling through adult stages in a significant number of species (Peters 2003). It is likely that such results are not unusual, but there have been few attempts to demonstrate J-C spacing at the adult stage. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Steinitz et al. (2011) studied the Mediterranean pine Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) and combined a unique situation with an innovative approach to provide the most elegant demonstration yet that adult recruits are spaced further from parents than expected from the initial seed distribution, clear evidence of a J-C effect carrying over to reproductive adults. A major advancement of this study is that it incorporates estimates of the initial patterns of seed dispersal and parentage analysis of adult-offspring relationships, illustrating the value of combined field and genetic approaches.

TI  - Effects of forest fragmentation on the recruitment success of the tropical tree Poulsenia armata at Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico
PY  - 2014
AB  - Recruitmentsuccessofindividualplantsislimitedbyanarrayofbioticandabioticfactors.Seedlingsurvival may experience high mortality due to negative density dependence or altered microclimatic conditions. This study reports regeneration of Poulsenia armata (Moraceae), in the fragmented landscape of the Los Tuxtlas region in south- eastern Mexico. Density, survival and growth of seedlings (<1 y) and juveniles (<150 cm height) of P. armata were predicted to be significantly lower in forest fragments compared with extensive continuous forest. Contrary to expectation,densitydidnotvarybetweenhabitats;however,wefoundtwicethenumberofseedlings(n =82)inforest fragments than in the continuous forest (n = 35). Forest fragments were associated with higher seedling densities close to adult trees. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence for negative density dependence in plant survival or growth. Survival and growth of P. armata were negatively impacted in forest fragments, with desiccation by warmer daily temperatures likely the cause of mortality, independent of density. Of the 111 individuals recorded in 2010 in forest fragments, 38% died over 2 y of census (n = 42), while 9% (n = 12) of the 127 individuals from the continuous forest died.Higherratesofmortalitysuggestthatconditionsinforestfragmentsaredetrimentaltoseedlingcohortsovertime. Low juvenile recruitment jeopardizes persistence of P. armata, in fragmented populations of this rain-forest tree.

TI  - Tree mycorrhizal type mediates the strength of negative density dependence in temperate forests
PY  - 2020
AB  - Recent plant–soil feedback experiments suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species experience stronger conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) than ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree species. Yet, how these findings inform our understanding of natural systems is limited because the roles of local soil conditions, light availability and tree species abundances in influencing CNDD for AM and EM species are not clear. Here we examined seedling and sapling survival in two temperate old‐growth forests (broad‐leaved pine and spruce‐fir forests) in Northeast China, to evaluate the effects of both conspecific and heterospecific neighbour density, as well as the soil and light environments, on the survival of AM‐ and EM‐dependent trees at early life stages. While light availability increased the survival of EM seedlings, soil organic resources increased EM sapling survival in the spruce‐fir plot. AM tree species suffered stronger CNDD than did EM tree species in both plots. In the spruce‐fir plot, soil factors and light availability mediated species CNDD but their effects differed between AM and EM species, and also between seedlings and saplings. For seedlings in both plots, we found that AM species exhibited a positive relationship between species abundance and CNDD strength, whereas this relationship was negative for EM species. Synthesis. Our results provide one of the few tests of how fungal symbioses determine species responses to intraspecific and interspecific interactions and the direct effects of local environmental conditions on seedling and sapling survival. We show that mycorrhizal type mediates the strength of CNDD and its relationship with species abundance. These results suggest that tree mycorrhizal association can determine the strength of CNDD effect on both rare and common species, and these CNDD differences are likely to influence the community composition of temperate forests.

TI  - Ecological processes maintaining differential tree species distributions in an Australian subtropical rain forest: implications for models of species coexistence
PY  - 2000
AB  - All stems greater than or equal to 1 cm dbh were measured, tagged, mapped and identified on a 1-ha plot of rain forest at Gambubal State Forest, south-east Queensland, Australia. The spatial patterns and size class distributions of 11 common tree species on the plot were assessed to search for mechanisms determining their distribution and abundance. The forest was species-poor in comparison to many lowland tropical forests and the common species are therefore present at relatively high densities. Despite this, only limited evidence was found for the operation of density-dependent processes at Gambubal. Daphnandra micrantha saplings were clumped towards randomly spaced adults, indicating a shift of distribution over time caused by differential mortality of saplings in these adult associated clumps. Ordination of the species composition in 25-m x 25-m subplots revealed vegetation gradients at that scale, which corresponded to slope across the plot. Adult basal area was dominated by a few large individuals of Sloanea woollsii but the comparative size class distributions and replacement probabilities of the 11 common species suggest that the forest will undergo a transition to a more mixed composition if current conditions persist. The current cohort of large S. woollsii individuals probably established after a large-scale disturbance event and the forest has not attained an equilibrium species composition.

TI  - Specialization of a fungal pathogen on host tree species in a cross-inoculation experiment
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary
1. In forest communities, the Janzen–Connell (J–C) model proposes that species diversity is maintained by noncompetitive distance- or density-dependent seedling mortality caused by host-specific natural enemies. Host specificity, however, has not been fully elucidated.

2. We conducted a cross-inoculation experiment to evaluate the host specificity of a pathogenic fungus, Colletotrichum anthrisci. The fungus was isolated from seedlings of four tree species (Prunus grayana, Fraxinus lanuginosa, Cornus controversa and Magnolia obovata), all of which were killed by damping-off disease beneath conspecific adults. Each fungal isolate was then inoculated into seedlings of P. grayana and F. lanuginosa. Molecular identification [internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences] also confirmed that all isolates (strains) showed 99–100% similarity with C. anthrisci, irrespective of their origin.

3. In both P. grayana and F. lanuginosa seedlings, all isolates of the pathogen caused damage, irrespective of origin, but the damage was more severe with the isolate from conspecifics rather than from any of the three heterospecifics.

4. In response to infection, callose papillae were deposited on the inner side of the leaf cell wall of seedlings in P. grayana; then, circular abscission layers formed between two layers of leaf cells surrounding the locus of infection. The central area of the infection was completely cut off from the rest of the leaf. In F. lanuginosa, infected leaves of seedlings were shed immediately after inoculation. This defensive behaviour, which may prevent further pathogen invasion, was more frequent in seedlings inoculated with isolates from conspecifics than from heterospecifics in both species.

5. Synthesis. Although the pathogenic fungus C. anthrisci is ubiquitous and attacks a wide range of host species, virulence was much stronger for strains derived from conspecifics rather than from heterospecifics, suggesting local adaptation and development of host specificity. If host specificity is common for several pathogens within a microbial community in a given area occupied by an adult, and the trait is also common for multiple tree species co-occurring within a forest community, the J–C model would be applicable to explain tree species diversity.

TI  - Spatial variation in soil-borne disease dynamics of a temperate tree, Prunus serotina
PY  - 2009
AB  - Soil-borne pathogens are posited to maintain forest diversity. However, their in situ impact and spatial variation are largely unknown. We examined spatial patterns of pathogenic activity in a deciduous forest using a common garden experiment and also in a natural experiment around replicated trees, and we quantified Pythium (a soil-borne pathogen) density around individual Prunus serotina trees. In both experiments, P. serotina seedling survival was 52-57% greater in plots treated with a metalaxyl-based fungicide specific to oomycetes (i.e., Pythium) than in untreated plots. Disease dynamics were not density dependent, but pathogenic activity and Pythium density were spatially variable. In the common garden and natural experiments, pathogenic activity of soil inoculum varied among trees, while in the natural experiment disease dynamics were also distance dependent and pathogenic activity decreased away from P. serotina trees. Disease and Pythium density were not always related but displayed considerable spatial variation. We found that Pythium density did not vary with distance away from P. serotina trees but did vary among trees. Understanding the spatial complexity of soil-borne pathogens is critical to accurately characterizing their effects on populations and ultimately on forest diversity.

TI  - Density‐dependent Survival in Seedlings Differs among Woody Life‐forms in Tropical Wet Forests of a Caribbean Island
PY  - 2015
AB  - Negative density dependence contributes to seedling dynamics in forested ecosystems, but the relative importance of this factor for different woody plant life-forms is not well-understood. We used 1 yr of seedling survivorship data for woody seedlings in 17 different plots of lower to mid-montane rain forests on the island of Dominica to examine how seedling height, abiotic factors, and biotic factors such as negative density dependence are related to seedling survival of five different life-forms (canopy, midstory, and understory trees; shrubs; and lianas). Across 64 species, taller seedlings in seedling plots with higher canopy openness, greater seedling density, lower relative abundance of conspecific seedlings, and lower relative abundance of conspecific adults generally had a greater probability of surviving. Height was the strongest predictor of seedling survival for all life-forms except lianas. Greater seedling density was positively related to survival for canopy and midstory trees but negatively related to survival for the other life-forms. For trees, the relative abundance of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors had weak and strong negative effects on survival respectively. Neither shrub nor liana seedling survival was affected by the relative abundance of conspecific neighbors. Thus, negative density dependence is confirmed as an important structuring mechanism for tree seedling communities but does not seem to be important for lianas and shrubs in Dominican rain forests. These results represent the first direct assessment of controls on seedling survival of all woody life-forms – an important step in understanding the dynamics and structure of the entire woody plant community.

TI  - Community-level consequences of density dependence and habitat association in a subtropical broad-leaved forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - How extraordinary numbers of species can coexist in hyper-diverse communities remains unresolved. While numerous hypotheses have been proposed based on observational and theoretical investigations, little is known about which mechanisms are truly active in forest communities and less is known about their relative contributions to community assembly. In this study, generalized linear mixed models with crossed random effects were used to assess the relative contributions of density dependence and habitat association to community-level diversity maintenance. Species habitat associations were classified based on soil nutrients, topography and species composition. Local neighbourhood effects were also addressed with spatially explicit models of seedling survival. The results shown here reveal that local- and community-level seedling dynamics were consistent with density-dependent predictions, although habitat association played a more important role in shaping short-term seedling survival. We conclude that density dependence could promote species coexistence on the premise of habitat partitioning.

TI  - NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS DETERMINE THE SPATIAL PATTERN OF TROPICAL TREE SEEDLING SURVIVAL
PY  - 2007
AB  - Factors affecting survival and recruitment of 3531 individually mapped seedlings of Myristicaceae were examined over three years in a highly diverse neotropical rain forest, at spatial scales of 1-9 m and 25 ha. We found convincing evidence of a community compensatory trend (CCT) in seedling survival (i.e., more abundant species had higher seedling mortality at the 25-ha scale), which suggests that density-dependent mortality may contribute to the spatial dynamics of seedling recruitment. Unlike previous studies, we demonstrate that the CCT was not caused by differences in microhabitat preferences or life history strategy among the study species. In local neighborhood analyses, the spatial autocorrelation of seedling survival was important at small spatial scales (1-5 m) but decayed rapidly with increasing distance. Relative seedling height had the greatest effect on seedling survival. Conspecific seedling density had a more negative effect on survival than heterospecific seedling density and was stronger and extended farther in rare species than in common species. Taken together, the CCT and neighborhood analyses suggest that seedling mortality is coupled more strongly to the landscape-scale abundance of conspecific large trees in common species and the local density of conspecific seedlings in rare species. We conclude that negative density dependence could promote species coexistence in this rain forest community but that the scale dependence of interactions differs between rare and common species.

TI  - Positive density dependence in seedlings of the neotropical tree species Garcinia macrophylla and Xylopia micans
PY  - 2009
AB  - Question: The Janzen-Connell hypothesis predicts that herbivores and pathogens prevent seedlings from establishing in dense patches near adult conspecifi cs. Although many studies have investigated the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, the environmental context – local or regional – in which juveniles establish is often overlooked. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate Janzen-Connell effects in contrasting environments, and (2) to incorporate microsite variation into the study of this hypothesis. Location: Pacaya-Samiria Reserve, Peru. Methods: I assessed seedling performance of two tree species, Garcinia macrophylla and Xylopia micans, during one growing season. In an observational study, mortality and growth rates were regressed against distance to the nearest adult conspecifi c, conspecifi c seedling density, heterospecifi c plant density, and several abiotic variables in upland and fl oodplain forests. Field and shadehouse experiments were used to isolate distance- and density-dependent effects. Results: Contrary to predictions, seedling survivorship increased in the presence of conspecifi c seedlings (Garcinia) and heterospecifi c understory plants (Garcinia and Xylopia) in the observational study. Survivorship in the fi eld experiment, however, was unaffected by conspecifi c seedling density or adult proximity. In the shadehouse, Garcinia growth rates were highest in fl oodplain soils collected near adult conspecifi cs, but mortality was unrelated to the soil’s habitat or proximity to an adult. Conclusions: The positive density dependence found in this study could have been produced by: (1) environmental factors that increase both density and survivorship, or (2) interspecifi c facilitation, if heterospecifi cs reduce herbivore or pathogen pressure on the focal species. Such interactions could help explain species coexistence in tropical forests.

TI  - Altered climate leads to positive density-dependent feedbacks in a tropical wet forest
PY  - 2020
AB  - Climate change is predicted to result in warmer and drier Neotropical forests relative to current conditions. Negative density-dependent feedbacks, mediated by natural enemies, are key to maintaining the high diversity of tree species found in the tropics, yet we have little understanding of how projected changes in climate are likely to affect these critical controls. Over 3 years, we evaluated the effects of a natural drought and in situ experimental warming on density-dependent feedbacks on seedling demography in a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico. In the +4°C warming treatment, we found that seedling survival increased with increasing density of the same species (conspecific). These positive density-dependent feedbacks were not associated with a decrease in aboveground natural enemy pressure. If positive density-dependent feedbacks are not transient, the diversity of tropical wet forests, which may rely on negative density dependence to drive diversity, could decline in a future warmer, drier world.

TI  - Sex allocation, pollen limitation and masting in whitebark pine
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Masting, the synchronous and episodic production of seed crops, is thought to benefit plant reproductive success through positive density-dependent effects on pollination, dispersal and seed survival. Of these, only increased pollination efficiency in mast years can be a proximate mechanism for masting by synchronizing reproductive effort across individuals through pollen coupling. 2. Increased pollination efficiency requires synchronous investment in male and female function during mast years. Sex allocation theory, however, predicts a trade-off in investment between male and female reproductive allocation dependent on total resources invested in reproduction. 3. We describe patterns of sex allocation in Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine), using data on pollen and seed cone counts over 5 years for 29 trees across 7 sites in Montana, U.S.A. 4. Whitebark pine seed cone maturation increased with site pollen cone production, indicating pollen limitation, and pollen and seed cone production were positively correlated across years. 5. Simulating mature seed cone production from these empirical relationships resulted in greater average mature seed cone production than alternative scenarios of (i) no synchrony between pollen cone production and pollen cone initiation, (ii) negative correlation (trade-off) between seed cone initiation and pollen cone production or (iii) no masting. 6. Synthesis. Our data support a role for pollination efficiency in both increasing long-term seed production and as a proximate mechanism for synchronizing masting in Pinus albicaulis. Increased pollination efficiency joins greater seed dispersal and survival in mast years seen in other studies, as an additional positive density-dependent benefit of masting. Positive density-dependent fitness benefits may therefore influence patterns of sex allocation in relation to total resources invested in reproduction. The pollen limitation found here combined with stand isolation and reduced tree density due to mortality from forest pests and other environmental stressors may lead to reduced seed cone maturation and changes in masting patterns.

TI  - Predicting dispersal of auto-gyrating fruit in tropical trees: a case study from the Dipterocarpaceae.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Seed dispersal governs the distribution of plant propagules in the landscape and hence forms the template on which density-dependent processes act. Dispersal is therefore a vital component of many species coexistence and forest dynamics models and is of applied value in understanding forest regeneration. Research on the processes that facilitate forest regeneration and restoration is given further weight in the context of widespread loss and degradation of tropical forests, and provides impetus to improve estimates of seed dispersal for tropical forest trees. South-East Asian lowland rainforests, which have been subject to severe degradation, are dominated by trees of the Dipterocarpaceae family which constitute over 40% of forest biomass. Dipterocarp dispersal is generally considered to be poor given their large, gyration-dispersed fruits. However, there is wide variability in fruit size and morphology which we hypothesize mechanistically underpins dispersal potential through the lift provided to seeds mediated by the wings. We explored experimentally how the ratio of fruit wing area to mass (“inverse wing loading,” IWL) explains variation in seed dispersal kernels among 13 dipterocarp species by releasing fruit from a canopy tower. Horizontal seed dispersal distances increased with IWL, especially at high wind speeds. Seed dispersal of all species was predominantly local, with 90% of seed dispersing <10 m, although maximum dispersal distances varied widely among species. We present a generic seed dispersal model for dipterocarps based on attributes of seed morphology and provide modeled seed dispersal kernels for all dipterocarp species with IWLs of 1–50, representing 75% of species in Borneo.

TI  - Seed abundance affects seed removal of an alien and a native tree in the Brazilian savanna: Implications for biotic resistance
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Invasive species are among the major threats to global biodiversity. Plant invasions are often driven by great propagule pressure that overcomes barriers to early colonisation and establishment, such as the biotic resistance from pathogens and seed predators. However, the way in which biotic resistance interacts with propagule pressure and affects seed survival remains poorly understood. Here, we experimentally assessed the effect of seed abundance on seed removal in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). We tested whether the invasive <jats:italic>Leucaena leucocephala</jats:italic> and the native <jats:italic>Anadenanthera macrocarpa</jats:italic> (both Fabaceae) differ in post‐dispersal seed removal – an indicator of granivore pressure – by different guilds of seed predators, varying seed abundance (2, 5 or 10 seeds of each species per treatment) and distance from a disturbance (5, 20 and 50 m from a firebreak) in two fragments of Cerrado. Treatment encounter, that is the chance of at least one seed being removed, increased 72% from 2 to 10 seeds per treatment, but seed removal increased only by 32%, suggesting a threshold in granivore response to seed availability. Native seeds suffered higher removal than exotic seeds, but removal rates did not vary with distance to disturbance or interact with vertebrate and invertebrate exclusions. Our results suggest a patchy pattern of seed predation influenced by resource abundance and emphasise the efficiency of high propagule pressure in overcoming the density‐dependent biotic resistance during early stages of exotic plant invasions in Cerrado. Seeds of fast‐germinating species, such as <jats:italic>L. leucocephala</jats:italic>, that reach appropriate spots for regeneration may still overcome the biotic resistance due to the patchy nature of seed predation.</jats:p><jats:p>Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.</jats:p>

TI  - Incorporating density dependence into the directed-dispersal hypothesis
PY  - 2010
AB  - The directed-dispersal (DrD) hypothesis, one of the main explanations for the adaptive value of seed dispersal, asserts that enhanced (nonrandom) arrival to favorable establishment sites is advantageous for plant fitness. However, as anticipated by the ideal free distribution theory, enhanced seed deposition may impair site suitability by increasing density-dependent mortality, thus negating the advantage postulated by the DrD hypothesis. Although the role of density effects is thoroughly discussed in the seed-dispersal literature, this DrD paradox remains largely overlooked. The paradox, however, may be particularly pronounced in animal-mediated dispersal systems, in which DrD is relatively common, because animals tend to generate local seed aggregations due to their nonrandom movements. To investigate possible solutions to the DrD paradox, we first introduce a simple analytical model that calculates the optimal DrD level at which seed arrival to favorable establishment sites yields maximal fitness gain ...

TI  - Recruitment limitation after mast-seeding in two African rain forest trees
PY  - 2010
AB  - Seed and establishment limitation can have a major role in determining plant species' abundances and distributions in communities. Their relative importance, however, remains uncertain and controversial, especially for trees in forests where density-dependent mortality of seeds and seedlings may be common. In a primary African rain forest, we directly tested the strength of each limitation by using seeds of the tree species Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberlinia bifoliolata at eight addition levels and by following establishment over six weeks. Local background seed rain was also measured. Seedling recruitment was higher in seed-addition quadrats than in control quadrats, indicating seed limitation in both species. However, fitting the Beverton-Holt model indicated that establishment limitation was consistently 2-4 times stronger than seed limitation for Microberlinia, whereas seed limitation greatly exceeded establishment limitation for Tetraberlinia. Strong density dependence was operating in the short seed-to-seedling transition for Microberlinia, whereas it was almost negligible for Tetraberlinia. Although early postdispersal mortality was very high for both species (>80%), they may achieve local codominance as a result of differing strengths of seed limitation vs. establishment limitation. Assessing the importance of seed limitation for tree populations requires a knowledge of species-specific seed rain as well as a reliable recruitment function. The outcome of early establishment processes also needs to be seen in the context of later stages of tree dynamics.

TI  - Variation of the biotic neighbourhood and topographic effects on tree survival in an old‐growth temperate forest
PY  - 2017
AB  - Question
Tree mortality can determine forest dynamics and succession, alter nutrient cycling and contribute to tree species coexistence. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain species diversity is a central goal of community ecology. In this study, we incorporated survival data from a 10-year interval census to determine whether there is significant interspecies variation in the effects of biotic neighbourhood variables and whether there is significant spatial variation in the effects of topographic variables on tree survival in a broadleaved-Korean pine temperate forest.

Location
A temperate forest in northeast China.

Methods
We used generalized linear mixed-effects models and geographically weighted generalized linear models as well as their corresponding test approaches to determine whether there is significant interspecies variation in the effects of biotic neighbourhood variables over variable neighbourhood radii and whether there is significant spatial variation in the effects of topographic variables on tree survival across multiple spatial scales in an old-growth temperate forest dynamics plot in northeast China.

Results
Our results showed that the effects of neighbourhood variables on tree survival varied among species and that those of topography varied over space. However, the results depended on the neighbourhood radius and spatial scale. The neighbourhood radius affected the detection of variation in neighbourhood effects among species, and the spatial scale similarly affected the detection of spatial variation in the effects of topography. The effect of conspecific neighbour density on survival varied more widely among species than that of the average phylogenetic dissimilarity of heterospecific neighbours regardless of the neighbourhood radius. Moreover, the effect of elevation varied more widely over space than those of convexity and hillshade at any quadrat scale.

Conclusions
Our findings highlight that future studies should account for variations in the neighbourhood radius among species and/or circumstances as well as the spatial scale when assessing the factors that contribute to species coexistence in long-lived organisms. Species leaf phenology, shade and drought tolerance and environmental filtering may explain these variations in the effects of neighbourhood and topographic variables on tree survival. Overall, our results indicate that both density dependence and resource niche partitioning are important mechanisms for maintaining biodiversity in this broadleaved-Korean pine temperate forest.

TI  - Contribution of conspecific negative density dependence to species diversity is increasing towards low environmental limitation in Japanese forests.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Species coexistence is a result of biotic interactions, environmental and historical conditions. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis assumes that conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is one of the local processes maintaining high species diversity by decreasing population growth rates at high densities. However, the contribution of CNDD to species richness variation across environmental gradients remains unclear. In 32 large forest plots all over the Japanese archipelago covering > 40,000 individual trees of > 300 species and based on size distributions, we analysed the strength of CNDD of individual species and its contribution to species number and diversity across altitude, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and maximum snow depth gradients. The strength of CNDD was increasing towards low altitudes and high tree species number and diversity. The effect of CNDD on species number was changing across altitude, temperature and snow depth gradients and their combined effects contributed 11-18% of the overall explained variance. Our results suggest that CNDD can work as a mechanism structuring forest communities in the Japanese archipelago. Strong CNDD was observed to be connected with high species diversity under low environmental limitations where local biotic interactions are expected to be stronger than in niche-based community assemblies under high environmental filtering.

TI  - Density‐dependent disease, life‐history trade‐offs, and the effect of leaf pathogens on a suite of co‐occurring close relatives
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Plant pathogens reduce the performance of their hosts and therefore may contribute to ecological mechanisms of coexistence. In Chesson’s framework, pathogens contribute to stabilizing mechanisms when they intensify negative intraspecific interactions, such as density‐dependent disease. Additionally, pathogens contribute to equalizing mechanisms when they reduce differences in performance among species. Life‐history trade‐offs predict higher susceptibility to pathogens in rapidly growing species, which could equalize performance among fast‐ and slow‐growing species in the presence of pathogens.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>In a coastal prairie in California, we studied the impact of leaf diseases on the performance of 17 co‐occurring species of <jats:italic>Trifolium</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Medicago </jats:italic>(“clovers”). We transplanted clovers in randomized arrays into the natural prairie community in 3 years of common garden experiments. We quantified infection rates by isolating fungi from leaves, and we measured disease severity as per cent leaf area damaged. In a fungicide experiment, we measured the impact of infection on biomass and survival. We assessed whether disease on transplants was positively related to natural abundance of that species in the surrounding community, which we monitored over 5 years. We assessed life‐history trade‐offs by testing whether more rapidly growing species were more susceptible to pathogens.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Rank abundance of clover species was stable over 5 years despite marked environmental fluctuations. Across hosts, fungal infection was not linearly related to density, although transplants of species that were locally absent showed lower and more variable infection. Disease severity was greater for more abundant species, but in only 1 of 3 years, and response to fungicide was not stronger in more abundant species. As predicted by life‐history trade‐offs, faster‐growing species experienced greater fungal infection. However, the impact of that infection was less negative, not more negative, on faster‐growing species.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Our results suggest that life‐history trade‐offs in plant–pathogen interactions may influence equalizing mechanisms among species in this guild, but the combined effects of greater infection with greater tolerance may limit rather than promote coexistence. We also found modest evidence that density‐dependent disease may contribute to stabilizing mechanisms. Lack of host specificity, rapid evolution of host use and temporal variation in climatic conditions may all influence the role that pathogens play in coexistence of these closely related plants.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Contrasting patterns of insect herbivory and predation pressure across a tropical rainfall gradient
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>One explanation for the extraordinarily high tree diversity of tropical lowland forests is that it is maintained by specialized natural enemies such as insect herbivores, which cause distance and density dependent mortality. Insect herbivory could also explain the positive correlation between tree species richness and rainfall if herbivory increases with rainfall, is higher on locally abundant versus rare species, and is not limited by predation pressure at wet sites. To test these predictions, insect herbivory and predation pressure on insect herbivores were quantified across a Neotropical rainfall and tree species richness gradient, and herbivory was investigated in relation to local tree abundances. Insect herbivory on leaves (folivory) decreased strongly and significantly with rainfall, while predation pressure was significantly higher at the wetter site. Herbivores were more likely to attack abundant tree species, but herbivore damage levels were not related to tree species abundance. Insect folivores might contribute to local tree species coexistence in our system, but seem unlikely to drive the positive correlation between tree species richness and rainfall. The unexpected and contrasting patterns of herbivory and predation we observed support the need for a multi‐trophic perspective to understand fully the processes contributing to diversity and ecosystem functioning.</jats:p></jats:sec>

TI  - Temporal changes in local spatial structure of late-successional species: establishment of an Andean caulescent rosette plant
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary 1 We analyse successional changes in local spatial structure of populations of a dominant late-successional species ( Espeletia schultzii ) in the high tropical Andes. 2 Spatial maps of plants of E. schultzii and important features of their environment were recorded at early (year 3) and middle (year 8) stages of succession after agricultural disturbance, and in non-cultivated paramo. 3 Spatial covariance functions were calculated from the maps to provide information on the changing ‘plant-eye’s view’ of seedlings and adults during succession, and on the coupling of spatial structure to dynamics of successional communities. 4 Seedlings of E. schultzii appeared at high densities shortly after agricultural disturbance ceased. Spatial aggregation, which among seedlings was strongest in later stages of succession, was absent among adults, suggesting greater mortality within aggregations of conspecifics plays a part in regulating population dynamics. 5 Early in succession, seedlings of E. schultzii were slightly segregated from the dominant early successional species, Rumex acetosella . By year 8 of succession, R. acetosella was strongly segregated from adults of E. schultzii , but not from seedlings. This suggests that competitive exclusion caused by asymmetric competition may contribute to decline in early successional species. 6 Spatial sorting in relation to abiotic factors was most evident in the mature paramo, with E. schultzii adults occurring on steeper slopes and on less stony ground. E. schultzii adults here were also segregated from Hypericum laricifolium , the other dominant species. 7 The coupling of local spatial structure to community dynamics may have profound effects on succession. In particular, the development of interspecific segregation could contribute to the continued coexistence of early and late successional species throughout succession.

TI  - Seed removal of Dipteryx alata Vog. (Leguminosae: Faboidae) in the edge and interior of Cerrado
PY  - 2017
AB  - Post-dispersal seed agents of mortality include pathogens, invertebrates, and vertebrates, which may shape tropical tree populations and communities. In this study I experimentally evaluated Dipteryx alata endocarp removal both in the interior and edge of Cerrado vegetation. Specifically, I simulated primary dispersion of endocarps by bats and evaluated secondary removal intensity according to habitat, season, and endocarp number. This study was developed in the Pombo Natural Municipal Park, a large Cerrado remnant with an area of 9,000 ha, located in the Western Brazil. In each of the two habitat types, I set down 45 points in which D. alata piles of 1, 3, 7, 15, and 40 endocarps were positioned. On average, endocarp removal in the interior was higher than in the edge, so that the intensity of removal varied from positive density-dependent (interior: rains), to negative density-dependent (edge: both seasons). Also, at both habitat types and seasons non removed endocarps were intensely attacked by fungus. Indeed, seed mortality by fungus infestation was positive density-dependent. The results indicate high propensity of endocarps to escape from removal in the edge, in principle, a defaunated area. As Dipteryx species strongly rely on caviomorph rodents for their dispersal, the scarcity of these vectors might reduce recruitment chances of D. alata in remnants of Cerrado. This imply in future changes in the vegetation structure from the edge to the interior towards low tree diversity.

TI  - Weaker plant-enemy interactions decrease tree seedling diversity with edge-effects in a fragmented tropical forest.
PY  - 2018
AB  - In fragmented forests, tree diversity declines near edges but the ecological processes underlying this loss of diversity remain poorly understood. Theory predicts that top-down regulation of seedling recruitment by insect herbivores and fungal pathogens contributes to maintaining tree diversity in forests, but it is unknown whether proximity to forest edges compromises these diversity-enhancing biotic interactions. Here we experimentally demonstrate that weakened activity of fungal pathogens and insect herbivores reduced seedling diversity, despite similar diversity of seed rain, during recruitment near forest edges in a human-modified tropical landscape. Only at sites farthest from forest edges (90–100 m) did the application of pesticides lower seedling diversity relative to control plots. Notably, lower seedling diversity corresponded with weaker density-dependent mortality attributable to insects and fungi during the seed-to-seedling transition. We provide mechanistic evidence that edge-effects can manifest as cryptic losses of crucial biotic interactions that maintain diversity. Tree diversity decreases at the edges of fragmented forests. Here, Krishnadas et al. find that weaker top-down regulation by insects and fungal pathogens during seedling recruitment contributes to reduced tree seedling diversity near forest edges in a human-modified landscape.

TI  - Defaunation impacts on seed survival and its effect on the biomass of future tropical forests
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:p>Large animal species, which provide important ecological functions such as dispersal of seeds or top–down control of seed predators, are very vulnerable in fragmented forests, being unable to survive in small fragments, and facing increasing hunting pressure. The loss of large animals affects two main ecological processes crucial for the tree reproductive cycle: seed dispersal of large seeds (e.g. provided by tapirs) and control of seed predator population (e.g. provided by large cats). The changes in both processes are expected to increase seed mortality since seeds are not dispersed away from conspecifics (causing increased pre‐dispersal mortality due to negative density dependent effects) and/or face increased predation after a dispersal event (post‐dispersal mortality). Although an extensive body of empirical knowledge exists on seed predation, the link between seed loss and adult tree community composition and structure is not well established, as well as the temporal scale seed changes affect adults. Using an individual‐based forest model (FORMIND), we evaluate the long‐term consequences of increased pre and post‐dispersal seed mortality on the future forest biomass retention of a Brazilian northeastern Atlantic forest. Our results show that forest biomass is significantly affected after 80–93% pre‐dispersal loss of large seeds, or post‐dispersal predation densities of 20–25 predators per parent tree. Large‐seeded tree species are at increased risk of local extinction causing up to 26.2% loss of forest biomass when both pre and post‐dispersal processes are combined. However, these changes can last up to 100 years after the occurrence of defaunation. In summary we conclude that large animal loss has the potential to reduce future forest biomass and tree species‐richness by impacting seed survival, and should be considered in the planning of biodiversity friendly landscapes as well as in calculations of the global carbon budget.</jats:p>

TI  - Interactions between large-scale and local factors influence seed predation rates and seed loss.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Herbivores often have highly variable impacts on plant fecundity. The relative contribution of different environmental factors operating at varying spatial scales in affecting this variability is often unclear. We examined how density-dependent seed predation at local scales and regional differences in primary productivity are associated with variation in the magnitude of pre-dispersal seed predation on <i>Monarda fistulosa</i> (Lamiaceae). Within <i>M. fistulosa</i> populations growing in a low-productivity region (LPR), Montana, USA, and a high-productivity region (HPR), Wisconsin, USA, we quantified the magnitude of pre-dispersal seed predation among individual plants differing in seed head densities. Out of a total of 303 <i>M. fistulosa</i> plants that were surveyed, we found half as many herbivores in seed heads in the LPR (<i>n</i> = 133 herbivores) compared to the HPR (<i>n</i> = 316). In the LPR, 30% of the seed heads were damaged in plants with low seed head density, while 61% of seed heads were damaged in plants with high seed head density. Seed head damage was consistently high in the HPR (about 49% across the range of seed head density) compared to the LPR (45% across a range of seed head density). However, the proportion of seeds per seed head that were destroyed by herbivores was nearly two times higher (~38% loss) in the LPR compared to HPR (22% loss). Considering the combined effects of probability of damage and seed loss per seed head, the proportion seed loss per plant was consistently higher in the HPR regardless of seed head density. Nevertheless, because of greater seed head production, the total number of viable seeds produced per plant was higher in HPR and high-density plants, despite being exposed to greater herbivore pressure. These findings show how large-scale factors can interact with local-scale factors to influence how strongly herbivores suppress plant fecundity.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi drive positive phylogenetic plant-soil feedbacks in a regionally dominant tropical plant family.
PY  - 2020
AB  - While work in temperate forests suggests that there are consistent differences in plant-soil feedback (PSF) between plants with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal associations, it is unclear whether these differences exist in tropical rainforests. We tested the effects of mycorrhizal type, phylogenetic relationships to overstory species, and soil fertility on the growth of tree seedlings in a tropical Bornean rainforest with a high diversity of both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. We found that ectomycorrhizal tree seedlings had higher growth in soils conditioned by close relatives and that this was associated with higher mycorrhizal colonization. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal tree seedlings generally grew more poorly in soils conditioned by close relatives. For ectomycorrhizal species, the phylogenetic trend was insensitive to soil fertility. For arbuscular mycorrhizal seedlings, however, the effect of growing in soils conditioned by close relatives became increasingly negative as soil fertility increased. Our results demonstrate consistent effects of mycorrhizal type on plant-soil feedbacks across forest biomes. The positive effects of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis may help explain biogeographic variation across tropical forests, such as familial dominance of the Dipterocarpaceae in southeast Asia. However, positive feedbacks also raise questions about the role of PSFs in maintaining tropical diversity.

TI  - Modification of Density Dependence and Habitat Filtering on Seedling Survival of Different Mycorrhizal-Type Tree Species in Temperate Forests
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and habitat filtering are critical to seedling survival. However, the relative importance of the two processes in affecting survival of seedlings with different types of mycorrhizae remains unclear. In this study, the effects of CNDD and habitat filtering on the survival of tree seedlings with different mycorrhizal types were investigated at different successional stages of a temperate forest in the Changbai Mountain Natural Reserve, Northeast China. Conspecific negative density dependence and habitat filtering significantly affected seedling survival. In the early successional stage, the interactions between conspecific neighbor tree density and light availability and soil properties significantly negatively affected survival of all species and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) seedlings in the community, but not that of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) seedlings, and the CNDD effect was stronger on AM seedlings than on EcM seedlings. In the mid-successional stage, CNDD effects were stronger on EcM seedlings. Therefore, different types of mycorrhizal seedlings responded differently to CNDD and habitat filtering mechanisms during community succession, and thus, tree mycorrhizal association could determine the effects of CNDD and habitat filtering on seedling survival in temperate forests.</jats:p>

TI  - Phylogenetic density dependence and environmental filtering predict seedling mortality in a tropical forest
PY  - 2011
AB  - Negative density dependence (NDD) and environmental filtering (EF) shape community assembly, but their relative importance is poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that seedlings mortality risk is positively related to the phylogenetic relatedness of neighbours. However, natural enemies, whose depredations often cause NDD, respond to functional traits of hosts rather than phylogenetic relatedness per se. To understand the roles of NDD and EF in community assembly, we assessed the effects on seedling mortality of functional similarity, phylogenetic relatedness and stem density of neighbouring seedlings and adults in a species-rich tropical forest. Mortality risks increased for common species when their functional traits departed substantially from the neighbourhood mean, and for all species when surrounded by close relatives. This indicates that NDD affects community assembly more broadly than does EF, and leads to the tentative conclusion that natural enemies respond to phylogenetically correlated traits. Our results affirm the prominence of NDD in structuring species-rich communities.

TI  - Distance and density dependence in two native Bornean dipterocarp species.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that density and distance-dependent mortality generated by specialist natural enemies prevent competitive dominance. Much literature on Janzen-Connell mechanisms comes from the neotropics, and evidence of the role of distance and density-dependence is still relatively sparse. We tested the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis in a South-East Asian system dominated by mast fruiting species. We hypothesized that seedling survival would decrease with distance and density, seedling growth would increase, and herbivory would decrease, according to the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Experiments were conducted to determine the strength of the Janzen-Connell mechanism by manipulating the density and identity of tree species as a function of the distance from parent trees. Survival of conspecific seedlings was reduced near adult trees of one species, but not another. High densities of seedlings decreased the growth of conspecific seedlings of both species. In both species, herbivory rates decreased with distance in low-density areas. This study indicates that dipterocarp species experienced weak Janzen-Connell effects of distance and density dependence at the growth stage studied. Future studies in this system might focus on earlier life-history stages such as seeds and small seedlings, as well as studying mortality during mast-seeding events.

TI  - Effects of Forest Fragment Area on Interactions Between Plants and Their Natural Enemies: Consequences for Plant Diversity at Multiple Spatial Scales
PY  - 2020
AB  - Density-dependent interactions between plants and their natural enemies, including fungal pathogens and insect herbivores, help maintain plant species coexistence and diversity at local scales (α-diversity). However, turnover in plant species composition across space also contributes to biodiversity at larger spatial scales (β-diversity). Despite mounting evidence that enemies can maintain α-diversity, we know little about their contributions to β-diversity. Additionally, in the light of widespread habitat fragmentation and potentially modified insect and pathogen communities in forest fragments, the effects of fragment area on their diversity-maintaining roles are largely unknown. We carried out a field experiment to investigate how natural enemies in impact tree α and β-diversity in a fragmented rainforest landscape in the Western Ghats, India. In twenty-one rainforest fragments, we suppressed insects and fungi/oomycetes with pesticides, and examined changes in the diversity of tree seedlings. We found that fungicide had no effect on α-diversity, but significantly decreased β-diversity (species turnover among plots). The facilitative effects of fungi and oomycetes on β-diversity, however, weakened as fragments decreased in area, indicating that certain specialized plant-pathogen interactions may be lost when fragments become smaller. Insecticide, in contrast, increased α-diversity. However, insects tended to increase β-diversity between distant plots. In summary, we found that interactions between plants and their natural enemies help maintain β-diversity in large forest fragments but not in small fragments. Small fragments are often viewed as future reservoirs of biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes, but our findings suggest that modified interactions with natural enemies may result in the erosion of this diversity over time.

TI  - Coral early life history dynamics: conspecific facilitation or limitation are dependent on distinct life stage interactions
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Replenishment of species within a community is largely determined by early life history dynamics, yet the relative contributions of settlement versus post-settlement processes in establishing coral community structure are not well understood. Here, we examined the effect of larval density, number of settlers and presence of conspecific adults on settlement and post-settlement success for 3 broadcast-spawning scleractinian corals under aquarium conditions. We found that settlement and post-settlement survival are dependent on larval or settler densities but with contrasting effects among the studied coral species. Settlement of <jats:italic>Anacropora spinosa</jats:italic> larvae was inversely density-dependent, while settlement of <jats:italic>Acropora gemmifera</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Acropora digitifera</jats:italic> larvae was density-independent. <jats:italic>A. spinosa</jats:italic> had high post-settlement survivorship, while <jats:italic>A. digitifera</jats:italic> underwent significant density-dependent post-settlement mortality within 14 d after settlement. <jats:italic>A. gemmifera</jats:italic> showed no significant trend in post-settlement survival by number of initial settlers, but had higher mortality in the second week than the first week, as did <jats:italic>A. digitifera</jats:italic>. For all species, settler spatial patterns were under-dispersed; the probability of contact between settlers positively correlated to initial settler numbers, and the extent of under-dispersion showed little change over time. The presence of conspecific adults led to a decrease in larval settlement of <jats:italic>A. spinosa</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>A. gemmifera</jats:italic> but had only a weak influence on settler survival for <jats:italic>A. spinosa</jats:italic>. These data indicate, in an experimental setting, that settlement success of larvae can be reduced when in close proximity to a conspecific adult and may be mediated by a waterborne agent. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential for self-limitation via conspecific larval-adult interactions and facilitation among early life stages of a cohort.</jats:p>

TI  - Density-dependence at multiple scales in experimental and natural plant populations
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. The survival and reproduction of individual plants may be related to the distribution of conspecific neighbours with which they interact. 2. We used 2 years’ data from a field experiment to relate the reproduction and survival of focal Silene latifolia plants to the numbers of conspecific plants and flowers within a range of distances (0.16‐150 m) from the focal plants. Thus we consider spatial scale as a continuously-varying component of population density. 3. Because the data come from a single continuous population, we fitted regression models in two stages in order to remove spatial autocorrelation induced by environmental factors before modelling density effects. As well as single-scale models, we fitted multiple-scale models to explore interaction kernels. We statistically standardized plant size in some analyses to isolate pollination effects. 4. Reproductive output per plant generally decreased with greater densities of plants and flowers; for example there was a negative effect of female flowers within a 70-m radius in the second year. However, at low female densities there was a positive effect of male flowers at a scale of 13 m in the first year. Seed-set per flower decreased with greater densities of flowers in the second year (at radii < 10 m). Seed predation was greater when more female flowers were present within 5‐7 m. Plants’ survival probability increased with density within 0.28 m for all but the smallest plants. 5. We also collected data on the pattern and reproductive success of S. latifolia plants in a natural population nearby and applied similar methodology. Here the negative effects of female flower densities occurred at finer scales and gave way to positive effects above 2 m, contrasting with some patterns from the experiment. 6. Synthesis. In a sessile population interacting with mobile biota, the effects of density on individual fitness may vary with the way in which density is measured. This, together with the methodological challenges for analysing spatial data from continuous populations, should be considered when designing and interpreting studies of spatial density-dependence. Taking these issues into account, we may begin to explain the spatial patterns of natural populations.

TI  - Surprising low diversity of the plant pathogen Phytophthora in Amazonian forests.
PY  - 2020
AB  - The genus Phytophthora represents a group of plant pathogens with broad global distribution. The majority of them cause the collar and root-rot of diverse plant species. Little is known about Phytophthora communities in forest ecosystems, especially in the Neotropical forests where natural enemies could maintain the huge plant diversity via negative density dependence. We characterized the diversity of soil-borne Phytophthora communities in the North French Guiana rainforest and investigated how they are structured by host identity and environmental factors. In this little-explored habitat, 250 soil cores were sampled from 10 plots hosting 10 different plant families across three forest environments (Terra Firme, Seasonally Flooded and White Sand). Phytophthora diversity was studied using a baiting approach and metabarcoding (High-Throughput Sequencing) on environmental DNA extracted from both soil samples and baiting-leaves. These three approaches revealed very similar communities, characterized by an unexpected low diversity of Phytophthora species, with the dominance of two cryptic species close to Phytophthora heveae. As expected, the Phytophthora community composition of the French Guiana rainforest was significantly impacted by the host plant family and environment. However, these plant pathogen communities are very small and are dominated by generalist species, questioning their potential roles as drivers of plant diversity in these Amazonian forests.

TI  - Drivers of seedling survival in a temperate forest and their relative importance at three stages of succession
PY  - 2015
AB  - Negative density dependence (NDD) and niche partitioning have been perceived as important mechanisms for the maintenance of species diversity. However, little is known about their relative contributions to seedling survival. We examined the effects of biotic and abiotic neighborhoods and the variations of biotic neighborhoods among species using survival data for 7503 seedlings belonging to 22 woody species over a period of 2 years in three different forest types, a half-mature forest (HF), a mature forest (MF), and an old-growth forest (OGF), each of these representing a specific successional stage in a temperate forest ecosystem in northeastern China. We found a convincing evidence for the existence of NDD in temperate forest ecosystems. The biotic and abiotic variables affecting seedlings survival change with successional stage, seedling size, and age. The strength of NDD for the smaller (<20 cm in height) and younger seedlings (1-2 years) as well as all seedlings combined varies significantly among species. We found no evidence that a community compensatory trend (CCT) existed in our study area. The results of this study demonstrate that the relative importance of NDD and habitat niche partitioning in driving seedling survival varies with seedling size and age and that the biotic and abiotic factors affecting seedlings survival change with successional stage.

TI  - Fine-scale processes shape ecosystem service provision by an Amazonian hyperdominant tree species
PY  - 2018
AB  - Conspecific distance and density-dependence is a key driver of tree diversity in natural forests, but the extent to which this process may influence ecosystem service provision is largely unknown. Drawing on a dataset of >135,000 trees from the Peruvian Amazon, we assessed its manifestation in biomass accumulation and seed production of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) which plays a keystone role in carbon sequestration and NTFP harvesting in Amazonia. For the first time, we find both negative and positive effects of conspecific proximity on seed production and above ground biomass at small and large nearest neighbour distances, respectively. Plausible explanations for negative effects at small distances are fine-scale genetic structuring and competition for shared resources, whereas positive effects at large distances are likely due to increasing pollen limitation and suboptimal growth conditions. Finally, findings suggest that most field plots in Amazonia used for estimating carbon storage are too small to account for distance and density-dependent effects and hence may be inadequate for measuring species-centric ecosystem services.

TI  - Multimodal pathogen transmission as a limiting factor in host distribution.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Theoretical models suggest that infectious diseases could play a substantial role in determining the spatial extent of host species, but few studies have collected the empirical data required to test this hypothesis. Pathogens that sterilize their hosts or spread through frequency-dependent transmission could have especially strong effects on the limits of species' distributions because diseased hosts that are sterilized but not killed may continue to produce infectious stages and frequency-dependent transmission mechanisms are effective even at very low population densities. We collected spatial pathogen prevalence data and population abundance data for alpine carnations infected by the sterilizing pathogen Microbotryum dianthorum, a parasite that is spread through both frequency-dependent (vector-borne) and density-dependent (aerial spore transmission) mechanisms. Our 13-year study reveals rapid declines in population abundance without a compensatory decrease in pathogen prevalence. We apply a stochastic, spatial model of parasite spread that accommodates spatial habitat heterogeneity to investigate how the population dynamics depend on multimodal (frequency-dependent and density-dependent) transmission. We found that the observed rate of population decline could plausibly be explained by multimodal transmission, but is unlikely to be explained by either frequency-dependent or density-dependent mechanisms alone. Multimodal pathogen transmission rates high enough to explain the observed decline predicted that eventual local extinction of the host species is highly likely. Our results add to a growing body of literature showing how multimodal transmission can constrain species distributions in nature.

TI  - Seed-dispersal ecology of tropical montane forests
PY  - 2016
AB  - Seed-dispersal ecology in tropical montane forests (TMF) differs in some predictable ways from tropical lowland forests (TLF). Environmental, biogeographic and biotic factors together shape dispersal syndromes which in turn influence forest structure and community composition. Data on diaspore traits along five elevational gradients from forests in Thailand, the Philippines, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria showed that diaspore size decreases with increasing altitude, fleshy fruits remain the most common fruit type but the relative proportion of wind-dispersed diaspores increases with altitude. Probably corresponding to diaspore size decreasing with increasing elevation, we also provide evidence that avian body size and gape width decrease with increasing altitude. Among other notable changes in the frugivorous fauna across elevational gradients, we found quantitative evidence illustrating that the proportion of bird versus mammalian frugivores increases with altitude, while TMF primates decrease in diversity and density, and switch diets to include less fruit and more leaf proportionately. A paucity of studies on dispersal distance and seed shadows, the dispersal/predation balance and density-dependent mortality thwart much-needed conclusive comparisons of seed dispersal ecology between TMF and TLF, especially from understudied Asian forests. We examine the available evidence, reveal knowledge gaps and recommend research to enhance our understanding of seed dispersal ecology in tropical forests. This review demonstrates that seed dispersal is a more deterministic and important process in tropical montane forests than has been previously appreciated.

TI  - The functional underpinnings of tropical forest dynamics—Functional traits, groups, and unmeasured diversity
PY  - 2024
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The structure and dynamics of forest ecosystems are the outcome of differential performance playing out at the individual level. Interactions between the traits of an organism and its environment determine performance. Thus, our ability to understand and, ultimately, model forest dynamics critically relies on knowledge regarding the functional biology of the organisms. In tropical forests, this is a daunting challenge due to the diversity of the systems. This has driven ecologists to focus on identifying a handful of fundamentally important trade‐offs and a few traits that may indicate where a species falls along that trade‐off axis. In other cases, some ecologists have argued that species can be roughly binned into a handful of functional groups or guilds that capture most of the information needed to generate realistic models of forest dynamics. Here, we discuss the functional biology of tropical forest dynamics. We identify a series of key trade‐offs that should underpin forest dynamics and the traits ecologists have attempted to link to these trade‐offs. We then explore how far we can get by using functional groups or guilds to model tropical forest dynamics, the conceptual frameworks used for promoting such approaches, and what this modeling framework does not capture. We then use this to identify key gaps that should motivate the future of tropical tree functional ecology.</jats:p>

TI  - Functional trait and phylogenetic tests of community assembly across spatial scales in an Amazonian forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Despite a long history of the study of tropical forests, uncertainty about the importance of different ecological processes in shaping tropical tree species distributions persists. Trait- and phylogenetic-based tests of community assembly provide a powerful way to detect community assembly processes but have seldom been applied to the same community. Both methods are well suited to testing how the relative importance of different ecological processes changes with spatial scale. Here we apply both methods to the Yasuni Forest Dynamics Plot, a 25-ha Amazonian forest with >1100 tree species. We found evidence for habitat filtering from both trait and phylogenetic methods from small (25 m2) to intermediate (10 000 m2) spatial scales. Trait-based methods detected even spacing of strategies, a pattern consistent with niche partitioning or enemy-mediated density dependence, at smaller spatial scales (25–400 m2). Simulation modeling of community assembly processes suggests that low statistical power to detect eve...

TI  - On the sympatric evolution and evolutionary stability of coexistence by relative nonlinearity of competition.
PY  - 2014
AB  - If two species exhibit different nonlinear responses to a single shared resource, and if each species modifies the resource dynamics such that this favors its competitor, they may stably coexist. This coexistence mechanism, known as relative nonlinearity of competition, is well understood theoretically, but less is known about its evolutionary properties and its prevalence in real communities. We address this challenge by using adaptive dynamics theory and individual-based simulations to compare community stabilization and evolutionary stability of species that coexist by relative nonlinearity. In our analysis, evolution operates on the species' density-compensation strategies, and we consider a trade-off between population growth rates at high and low resource availability. We confirm previous findings that, irrespective of the particular model of density dependence, there are many combinations of overcompensating and undercompensating density-compensation strategies that allow stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. However, our analysis also shows that most of these strategy combinations are not evolutionarily stable and will be outcompeted by an intermediate density-compensation strategy. Only very specific trade-offs lead to evolutionarily stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. As we find no reason why these particular trade-offs should be common in nature, we conclude that the sympatric evolution and evolutionary stability of relative nonlinearity, while possible in principle, seems rather unlikely. We speculate that this may, at least in part, explain why empirical demonstrations of this coexistence mechanism are rare, noting, however, that the difficulty to detect relative nonlinearity in the field is an equally likely explanation for the current lack of empirical observations, and that our results are limited to communities with non-overlapping generations and constant resource supply. Our study highlights the need for combining ecological and evolutionary perspectives for gaining a better understanding of community assembly and biogeographic patterns.

TI  - Crop damage of Eriotheca gracilipes (Bombacaceae) by the Blue-Fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva, Psittacidae), in the Brazilian Cerrado
PY  - 2014
AB  - Seed predation has major effects on the reproductive success of individuals, spatial patterns of populations, genetic variability, interspecific interactions and ultimately in the diversity of tree communities. At a Brazilian savanna, I evaluated the proportional crop loss of Eriotheca gracilipes due the Blue-Fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) during a fruiting period. Also, I analyzed the relationship between proportional crop loss to Amazons and both fruit crop size and the distance from the nearest damaged conspecific. Trees produced from 1 to 109 fruits, so that Amazons foraged more often on trees bearing larger fruit crop size, while seldom visited less productive trees. Moreover, the relationship between fruit crop sizes and the number of depredated fruits was significant. However, when only damaged trees were assessed, I found a negative and significant relation between fruit crop size and proportional crop loss to Blue-Fronted Amazons. Taking into account this as a measure more directly related to the probability of seed survival, a negative density dependent effect emerged. Also, Amazons similarly damaged the fruit crops of either close or distant neighboring damaged trees. Hence, in spite of Blue-Fronted Amazons searched for E. gracilipes bearing large fruit crops, they were swamped due to the presence of more fruits than they could eat. Moderate seed predation by Blue-Fronted Amazons either at trees with large fruit crops or in areas where fruiting trees were aggregated implies in an enhanced probability of E. gracilipes seed survival and consequent regeneration success.

TI  - Frugivore loss limits recruitment of large-seeded trees
PY  - 2011
AB  - Although global declines in frugivores may disrupt seed dispersal mutualisms and inhibit plant recruitment, quantifying the likely reduction in plant regeneration has been difficult and rarely attempted. We use a manipulative factorial experiment to quantify dependence of recruitment on dispersal (i.e. fruit pulp removal and movement of seed away from parental area) in two large-seeded New Zealand tree species. Complete dispersal failure would cause a 66 to 81 per cent reduction in recruitment to the 2-year-old seedling stage, and synergistic interactions with introduced mammalian seed and seedling predators increase the reduction to 92 to 94 per cent. Dispersal failure reduced regeneration through effects on seed predation, germination and (especially) seedling survival, including distance- and density-dependent (Janzen–Connell) effects. Dispersal of both species is currently largely dependent on a single frugivore, and many fruits today remain uneaten. Present-day levels of frugivore loss and mammal seed and seedling predators result in 57 to 84 per cent fewer seedlings after 2 years. Our study demonstrates the importance of seed dispersal for local plant population persistence, and validates concerns about the community consequences of frugivore declines.

TI  - Plant–soil feedback links negative distance dependence and light gradient partitioning during seedling establishment
PY  - 2013
AB  - Tree species coexistence has often been explained through either negative distance-dependent/density-dependent (NDD) mortality or resource-based niche partitioning. However, these two influential mechanisms for structuring community dynamics have rarely been investigated simultaneously. Negative conspecific effects, like those caused by plant–soil feedbacks (PSF), could link these two mechanisms by being restricted to low-light environments and determined by seedling shade intolerance. We conducted a 10 week long greenhouse experiment where we assessed survivorship of eight temperate tree species that varied in local adult abundance and seedling shade tolerance, to non-sterile vs. sterile soils collected under the canopy of conspecific vs. heterospecific adult trees grown at low and high light. We found that half of our species experienced strong negative conspecific feedbacks. For three out of four species, the PSF were biotic mediated. However, their effects on survival were often restricted to low-ligh...

TI  - From seed dispersal service to reproductive collapse: density‐dependent outcome of a palm–mammal interaction
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Interspecific ecological interactions are inherently context‐dependent. They may vary in both magnitude and sign depending on the biotic and abiotic conditions, depicting a mutualism–antagonism continuum. However, how population abundances and the activity of interacting species modulate these interactions remains underexplored. Here, we chose the interaction between the Mediterranean palm <jats:italic>Chamaerops humilis</jats:italic> and the feral goat <jats:italic>Capra hircus</jats:italic> in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). We selected three study plots with low, intermediate and high intensities of goat activity where we characterized palm distribution, seed rain, seed predation and early palm recruitment during two consecutive years. Since goats can cause both costs (e.g. florivory) and benefits (e.g. seed dispersal) to <jats:italic>C. humilis</jats:italic> performance, we investigated the following three questions: 1) does the spatial distribution of adult palms vary depending on the intensity of goat activity? 2) Does the intensity of goat activity influence seed rain and its potential spatial association with adult palms? 3) To what extent does the intensity of goat activity determine post‐dispersal events such as seed predation and seedling emergence? We found that adult palms showed a more clumped and complex distribution (double‐cluster process) in plots with low and intermediate goat activity compared to that with high goat activity (simple‐cluster process). In the low goat activity plot, dispersed seeds were spatially aggregated around adult palms, showing twice as much insect‐seed predation and nearly three times lower seed germination success than those in the intermediate goat activity plot. Palm seed dispersal and recruitment were almost nil in the high goat activity plot due to heavy consumption of palm inflorescences and developing fruits by goats. Our findings demonstrate how the net outcome of plant–animal interactions can change from mutualism to antagonism, from reproductive service to reproductive collapse, depending on the abundance and the activity of the interacting species.</jats:p>

TI  - Deep-sea diversity : Overlooked messages from shallow-water sediments
PY  - 2000
AB  - Much of the discussion of high deep-sea diversity has assumed that asymmetric inter-specific competition will rapidly lead to the elimination of many species unless restrained by extensive differentiation of niches, or the action of predation and/or environmental disturbance. This is true for some habitats, including rocky shores. However, experimental studies indicate that marine soft sediment communities do not function like this. In shallow-water sediments, competition is usually symmetric and relatively weak. Asymmetric competition that leads to the elimination of one species by another on time scales shorter than one generation is rare, apart from interactions that involve large-scale modification or disturbance of the sediment. Competition is therefore relatively unimportant as a process structuring communities and the impact of predation is usually to reduce rather than enhance diversity. These results have been largely ignored by the literature on deep-sea diversity. If deep-sea communities function in similar ways, coexistence of many species within small areas on short time scales does not need further explanation. We do, however, need to explain why abundances of all species remain bounded on large spatial scales and time scales of several generations. The model of diversity maintenance proposed by Huston (1979) and applied to the deep sea by Rex (1983) achieves this by implicit intra-specific, density-dependent processes that increase the population growth rate of species that have become locally rare. This would give robust maintenance of diversity, but there is no evidence for density dependence of this type in the deep sea, and no plausible mechanisms by which it could occur. Alternative models require either spatial heterogeneity on a scale much larger than that envisaged by the grain-matching hypothesis or the placing of a cap on the abundance of common species, perhaps by frequency-dependent predation. Arbitrating between these possibilities will require assessments of the population dynamics and spatial distribution of individual species on spatial and temporal scales much greater than those usually considered in the deep sea.

TI  - Plant Ontogeny, Spatial Distance, and Soil Type Influence Patterns of Relatedness in a Common Amazonian Tree
PY  - 2013
AB  - The formation of spatial genetic structure (SGS) may originate from different patterns of seed deposition in the landscape, and is mostly determined by seed dispersal limitation. After dispersal, mechanisms such as filtering by environmental factors or attack by herbivores/pathogens throughout plant development stages, and potentially either disrupt or intensify SGS patterns. We investigated how the genotype of Protium subserratum (Burseraceae), a common tree species in the Ducke Reserve, Brazil, is distributed across the landscape. We used seven microsatellite markers to assess the SGS among plants at different life stages and in different environments. By quantifying the patterns of relatedness among plants of different sizes, we inferred the ontogenetic stage in which SGS changes occurred, and compared these effects across soil types. Relatedness among seedlings decreased when distance between seedlings increased, especially for the youngest seedlings. However, this trend was not continued by older plants, as relatedness values were higher among neighboring individuals of the juvenile and adult size class. Contrasting relatedness patterns between seedlings and larger individuals suggests a trade-off between the negative effects of being near closely-related adults (e.g. due to herbivore and pathogen attack) and the advantage of being in a site favorable to establishment. We also found that soil texture strongly influenced density-dependence patterns, as young seedlings in clay soils were more related to each other than were seedlings in bottomland sandy soils, suggesting that the mechanisms that create and maintain patterns of SGS within a population may interact with environmental heterogeneity.

TI  - Janzen-Connell effects shape gene flow patterns and realized fitness in the tropical dioecious tree Spondias purpurea (ANACARDIACEAE).
PY  - 2020
AB  - Pollination and seed dispersal patterns determine gene flow within plant populations. In tropical forests, a high proportion of trees are dioecious, insect pollinated and dispersed by vertebrates. Dispersal vectors and density dependent factors may modulate realized gene flow and influence the magnitude of Fine Scale Genetic Structure (FSGS), affecting individual fitness. Spondias purpurea is a vertebrate-dispersed, insect-pollinated dioecious tropical tree. We assessed the influence of sex ratio, effective and realized gene flow on genetic diversity, FSGS and individual fitness within a 30 ha plot in the tropical dry forest reserve of Chamela-Cuixmala, Mexico. All individuals within the plot were tagged, geo-referenced and sampled for genetic analysis. We measured dbh and monitored sex expression during two reproductive seasons for all individuals. We collected seeds directly from maternal trees for effective pollen dispersal analysis, and analyzed established seedlings to assess realized pollen and seed dispersal. Nine microsatellite loci were used to describe genetic diversity parameters, FSGS and gene flow patterns among different size classes. A total of 354 individuals were located and classified into three size classes based on their dbh ( 20 cm). Population sex ratios were male biased and diametric size distributions differed among sexes, these differences may be the result of precocious male reproduction at early stages. Autocorrelation analyses indicate low FSGS (Fj <0.07) across all size classes. Long realized pollen and seed dispersal and differences among effective and realized gene flow were detected. In our study site low FSGS is associated with high gene flow levels. Effective and realized gene flow indicate a population recruitment curve indicating Janzen-Connell effects and suggesting fitness advantages for long-distance pollen and seed dispersal events.

TI  - The dispersion of eggs by a bruchid beetle among Scheelea palm seeds and the effect of distance to the parent palm
PY  - 1983
AB  - Larvae of an unidentified bruchid beetle develop within and kill seeds of the palm Scheelea zonensis. Only one larva can develop per seed. Hence, a selective advantage should accrue to female bruchids that oviposit on previously unattacked (pristine) fruit. On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, I performed experiments to test the following hypotheses. (1) H(,: female bruchids do not distinguish between previously attacked and pristine fruit, and (2) Ho: female bruchids oviposit at random among Scheelea fruit. Both null hypotheses were rejected. Female bruchids oviposit more frequently on pristine fruit, and female bruchids disperse their eggs uniformly among Scheelea fruit. Such sophisticated seed predators might search large areas for pristine seeds. As a result, seed- predation rates may fall slowly with distance from the parent palm. To test this hypothesis, I exposed Scheelea fruit at distances of 1, 8, 16, and 100 m from the nearest fruiting palm. Within 16 m, bruchid attack rates were uniformly high. However, at 100 m there was a significant decline. Other studies have found declines in seed predation rates, but only over similarly large distances. This has important implications for the mechanism by which density-dependent seed predation might contribute to the coexistence of tropical trees.

TI  - Enemies Maintain Hyperdiverse Tropical Forests
PY  - 2012
AB  - AbstractUnderstanding tropical forest tree diversity has been a major challenge to ecologists. In the absence of compensatory mechanisms, two powerful forces, drift and competition, are expected to erode diversity quickly, especially in communities containing scores or hundreds of rare species. Here, I review evidence bearing on four compensatory mechanisms that have been subsumed under the terms “density dependence” or “negative density dependence”: (1) intra- and (2) interspecific competition and the action of (3) density-responsive and (4) distance-responsive biotic agents, as postulated by Janzen and Connell. To achieve ontological integration, I examine evidence based on studies employing seeds, seedlings, and saplings. Available evidence points overwhelmingly to the action of both host-generalist and host-restricted biotic agents as causing most seed and seedling mortality, implying that species diversity is maintained via top-down forcing. The overall effect of most host-generalist seed predators a...

TI  - Seasonal differentiation in density-dependent seedling survival in a tropical rain forest
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. Density-dependent survival is prevalent in tropical forests and is recognized as a potentially important mechanism for maintaining tree species diversity. However, there is little knowledge of how density dependence changes in fluctuating environments. 2. Across the 20-ha Xishuangbanna tropical seasonal rain forest dynamics plot in southwest China, which has distinct dry and wet seasons, we monitored seedling survival in 453 1-m 2 quadrats over 2 years. Density dependence was assessed using generalized linear mixed models with crossed random effects. 3. When pooling all species at the community level, there were strong negative effects of conspecific tree neighbours on seedling survival over the dry-season, wet-season and 2-year intervals. The proportion of conspecific seedling neighbours had a significant negative effect in the dry season, but not in the wet season. 4. At the species level, the effects of conspecific tree and seedling neighbours varied widely among species in the community and were significantly positively related to population basal area in the community over the dry-season interval. In contrast, over the wet-season interval, the effects of conspecific tree and seedling neighbours did not significantly vary among species in the community. Overall community- and species-level results suggest that local-scale negative density dependence (NDD) tends to be stronger in the dry than wet season in the Xishuangbanna tropical forest. 5. At the scale of the 20-ha plot, we found a community compensatory trend (CCT), in which rare species had relatively higher seedling survival than common species in both the wet and dry seasons. A positive association between potential NDD and population basal area suggests that the CCT results from local-scale NDD, specifically because of negative effects of conspecific tree neighbours. 6. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the strength of density-dependent seedling survival can vary between seasons and among species in tropical forests. Future research is needed to assess the underlying mechanisms of this temporal and interspecific variation in NDD and its consequences for species coexistence and community composition.

TI  - Relative influence of relatedness, conspecific density and microhabitat on seedling survival and growth of an animal‐dispersed Neotropical palm, Oenocarpus bataua
PY  - 2016
AB  - We report on a 6-year, field-based experiment in north-western Ecuador, evaluating the relative importance of relatedness, conspecific density and microhabitat on the growth and survival of seedlings of an ecologically and economically important palm, Oenocarpus bataua. We planted O. bataua seedlings in high-density seed deposition sites (leks) of the long-wattled umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger) and randomly selected control sites. We analysed seedling performance in relation to conspecific relatedness, conspecific density and microhabitat. Among the parameters we measured, light availability was the most important determinant for survival and growth. Higher relatedness of neighbouring experimental seedlings and higher conspecific seedling densities were both associated with reduced growth, but did not influence survival, even in umbrellabird leks. These findings are consistent with a survival advantage of umbrellabird dispersal into lek sites (i.e. directed dispersal) that counterbalances negative density-dependent processes expected to occur at these high-density deposition sites. This study highlights the importance of a multi-tiered approach to understanding palm demography and underlines the importance of seed disperser behaviour in determining seedling fate.

TI  - Negative Density Dependence Regulates Two Tree Species at Later Life Stage in a Temperate Forest
PY  - 2014
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated that tree survival is influenced by negative density dependence (NDD) and differences among species in shade tolerance could enhance coexistence via resource partitioning, but it is still unclear how NDD affects tree species with different shade-tolerance guilds at later life stages. In this study, we analyzed the spatial patterns for trees with dbh (diameter at breast height) ≥2 cm using the pair-correlation g(r) function to test for NDD in a temperate forest in South Korea after removing the effects of habitat heterogeneity. The analyses were implemented for the most abundant shade-tolerant (Chamaecyparis obtusa) and shade-intolerant (Quercus serrata) species. We found NDD existed for both species at later life stages. We also found Quercus serrata experienced greater NDD compared with Chamaecyparis obtusa. This study indicates that NDD regulates the two abundant tree species at later life stages and it is important to consider variation in species' shade tolerance in NDD study.

TI  - Predicting the Long-Term Effects of Hunting on Plant Species Composition and Diversity in Tropical Forests
PY  - 2007
AB  - Hunting can change abundances of vertebrate seed predators and seed dispersers, causing species-specific changes in seed dispersal and seed predation and altering seedling communities. What are the consequences of these changes for the adult plant community in the next generation and beyond? Here, I derive equations showing how reduced seed dispersal reduces plant reproduction by intensifying kin competition, increasing vulnerability to natural enemies, and reducing the proportion of seeds passing through disperser guts. I parameterize these equations with available empirical data to estimate the likely effects on next-generation abundances. I then consider the indirect effects and longer-term feedbacks of changed seed or adult abundances on reproductive rates due to density-dependent interactions with natural enemies and mutualists, as well as niche differentiation with competitors, and discuss their likely qualitative effects. The factors limiting seed disperser and seed predator populations in natural and hunted forests emerge as critical for determining the long-term effects of hunting on rates of seed dispersal and seed predation. For example, where seed dispersers are held to a constant abundance by hunters, decreases in the availability of their preferred food plants are expected to lead to increased per-seed dispersal probabilities, potentially to the point of compensating for the initial disperser decline. I close by discussing the likely reversibility of hunting-induced changes in tropical forests and key questions and directions for future research.

TI  - The effect of conspecific density, herbivory, and bamboo on seedling dynamics of a dominant oak in a Neotropical highland forest
PY  - 2019
AB  - Conspecific negative density-dependence (CNDD) is one of the main mechanisms proposed to regulate species coexistence. Tropical highland forests, in contrast to diverse lowland forests, are commonly dominated by a few tree species. Testing the importance of density-dependence effects on seedling establishment of dominant trees may provide insights on the mechanisms regulating population dynamics and forest composition of tropical highlands. We tested the importance of CNDD regulation on seedling survival and recruitment of Quercus costaricensis, a monodominant oak in the Talamanca highland forests of Costa Rica. We used spatial statistics and generalized linear mixed models to test the effects of conspecific density, distance to the nearest adult, density of Chusquea bamboo shoots, and herbivory on the annual survival probability of 3538 seedlings between 2014 and 2017. We did not find any effect of CNDD on seedling survival. However, bamboo density and herbivory both significantly decreased seedling survival. All seedlings had signs of herbivory and predator satiation may explain the lack of density dependent regulation in this species. We argue that the lack of intraspecific density regulation at the seedling stage may explain the dominance of Q. costaricensis in the highland forests of Costa Rica. Local density of this endemic oak is instead regulated by herbivory and the density of Chusquea.

TI  - Fitting Ecological Process Models to Spatial Patterns Using Scalewise Variances and Moment Equations
PY  - 2013
AB  - AbstractEcological spatial patterns are structured by a multiplicity of processes acting over a wide range of scales. We propose a new method, based on the scalewise variance—that is, the variance as a function of spatial scale, calculated here with wavelet kernel functions—to disentangle the signature of processes that act at different and similar scales on observed spatial patterns. We derive exact and approximate analytical solutions for the expected scalewise variance under different individual-based, spatially explicit models for sessile organisms (e.g., plants), using moment equations. We further determine the probability distribution of independently observed scalewise variances for a given expectation, including complete spatial randomness. Thus, we provide a new analytical test of the null model of spatial randomness to understand at which scales, if any, the variance departs significantly from randomness. We also derive the likelihood function that is needed to estimate parameters of spatial mod...

TI  - Effects of local biotic neighbors and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival in a spruce-fir valley forest, northeastern China.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Seedlings are vulnerable to many biotic and abiotic agents, and studying seedling dynamics helps understand mechanisms of species coexistence. In this study, the relative importance of biotic neighbors and habitat heterogeneity to seedling survival was examined by generalized linear mixed models for 33 species in a spruce-fir valley forest in northeastern China. The results showed that the relative importance of these factors varied with species and functional groups. Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) was important to the survival of Abies nephrolepis and Picea koraiensis seedling, whereas phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD) was critical to Pinus koraiensis and Betula platyphylla, as well as functional groups of tree, deciduous, and shade-intolerant seedlings. For shrubs and Acer ukurunduense, habitat heterogeneity was significant. Despite of the significance of CNDD, PNDD, and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival, large proportions of the total variance were not accounted for by the studied variables, suggesting the needs to examine the influences of other factors such as pests, diseases, herbivores, forest structure, species functional traits, and microclimatic conditions on seedling survival in the future.

TI  - Negative density dependence and environmental heterogeneity effects on tree ferns across succession in a tropical montane forest
PY  - 2014
AB  - Although tree ferns are an important component of temperate and tropical forests, very little is known about their ecology. Their peculiar biology (e.g., dispersal by spores and two-phase life cycle) makes it difficult to extrapolate current knowledge on the ecology of other tree species to tree ferns. In this paper, we studied the effects of negative density dependence (NDD) and environmental heterogeneity on populations of two abundant tree fern species, Cyathea caracasana and Alsophila engelii, and how these effects change across a successional gradient. Species patterns harbor information on processes such as competition that can be easily revealed using point pattern analysis techniques. However, its detection may be difficult due to the confounded effects of habitat heterogeneity. Here, we mapped three forest plots along a successional gradient in the montane forests of Southern Ecuador. We employed homogeneous and inhomogeneous K and pair correlation functions to quantify the change in the spatial pattern of different size classes and a case–control design to study associations between juvenile and adult tree ferns. Using spatial estimates of the biomass of four functional tree types (short- and long-lived pioneer, shade- and partial shade-tolerant) as covariates, we fitted heterogeneous Poisson models to the point pattern of juvenile and adult tree ferns and explored the existence of habitat dependencies on these patterns. Our study revealed NDD effects for C. caracasana and strong environmental filtering underlying the pattern of A. engelii. We found that adult and juvenile populations of both species responded differently to habitat heterogeneity and in most cases this heterogeneity was associated with the spatial distribution of biomass of the four functional tree types. These findings show the effectiveness of factoring out environmental heterogeneity to avoid confounding factors when studying NDD and demonstrate the usefulness of covariate maps derived from mapped communities.

TI  - Effects of landscape structure on the invasive spread of black cherry Prunus serotina in an agricultural landscape in Flanders, Belgium
PY  - 2005
AB  - Analysing invasive spread from a landscape ecological perspective forms an important challenge in plant invasion ecology. The present study examines the effects of landscape structure on the spatial and temporal dynamics of an expanding black cherry Prunus serotina population within a rural landscape in Flanders, Belgium, carrying a dense network of interconnected hedgerows. The study area, 251 ha in size, harboured a total of 2962 P. serotina individuals. The population was characterised by a negative exponential age distribution, a high growth rate and an early and continuous reproduction throughout the species’ life cycle. The historical rate of spread of the species through the hedgerow network progressively increased with time, especially during the last decade. Spatial point pattern analysis revealed that the individuals had a significantly clustered distribution pattern and were spatially aggregated around seed sources, hedgerow intersections and roosting trees. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the effect of landscape structure on P. serotina occurrence, suggesting directional long distance dispersal by avian dispersal vectors, resulting in a differential seed pressure throughout the hedgerow network due to the preference of dispersing birds for roosting in structurally rich hedgerow with large trees near hedgerow intersections. Hence, the distribution of P. serotina in agricultural landscapes was strongly mediated by dispersal processes. Furthermore, decreasing spatial aggregation along the species life cycle, with especially seedlings and saplings being significantly aggregated while adult individuals were mostly distributed at random, and a relative outward shift of seedling recruitment curves with time indicate density dependent mortality, probably caused by intraspecific competition.

TI  - Tree diversity promotes insect herbivory in subtropical forests of south-east China
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Insect herbivory can strongly affect ecosystem processes, and its relationship with plant diversity is a central topic in biodiversity–functioning research. However, very little is known about this relationship from complex ecosystems dominated by long-lived individuals, such as forests, especially over gradients of high plant diversity. 2. We analysed insect herbivory on saplings of 10 tree and shrub species across 27 forest stands differing in age and tree species richness in an extraordinarily diverse subtropical forest ecosystem in China. We tested whether plant species richness significantly influences folivory in these highly diverse forests or whether other factors play a more important role at such high levels of phytodiversity. 3. Leaf damage was assessed on 58 297 leaves of 1284 saplings at the end of the rainy season in 2008, together with structural and abiotic stand characteristics. 4. Species-specific mean damage of leaf area ranged from 3% to 16%. Herbivory increased with plant species richness even after accounting for potentially confounding effects of stand characteristics, of which stand age-related aspects most clearly covaried with herbivory. Intraspecific density dependence or other abiotic factors did not significantly influence overall herbivory across forest stands. 5. Synthesis. The positive herbivory–plant diversity relationship indicates that effects related to hypotheses of resource concentration, according to which a reduction in damage by specialized herbivores might be expected as host plant concentration decreases with increasing plant diversity, do not seem to be major determinants for overall herbivory levels in our phytodiverse subtropical forest ecosystem. We discuss the potential role of host specificity of dominant herbivores, which are often expected to show a high degree of specialization in many (sub)tropical forests. In the forest system we studied, a much higher impact of polyphagous species than traditionally assumed might explain the observed patterns, as these species can profit from a broad dietary mix provided by high plant diversity. Further testing is needed to experimentally verify this assumption.

TI  - Biotic and abiotic drivers of dipterocarp seedling survival following mast fruiting in Malaysian Borneo
PY  - 2014
AB  - South-East Asian tropical rain forests experience sporadic, but profuse, seed production after general flowering, leading to the synchronous emergence of various seedlings and subsequent seedling dynamics, which play a crucial role in determining species distribution and coexistence. We examined the relative importance of both biotic (initial height, conspecific seedling density) and abiotic (canopy openness, per cent sand, soil water content) drivers using survival data for 1842 seedlings of 12 dipterocarp species for 1.5 y following mast fruiting in an old-growth Bornean tropical rain forest. More than 30% of all dipterocarp seedlings survived 1.5 y after mast fruiting. When all species were analysed together, we found that initial seedling height, canopy openness and conspecific seedling density affected dipterocarp seedling survival. Negative density dependence indicated that predators were not satiated, but dipterocarp seedlings rather suffered from host-specific natural enemies or intraspecific competition. Species-level analyses of seven dipterocarp species showed large variation in response to biotic and abiotic factors. These results suggest that interspecific differences in the relative importance of biotic and abiotic effects on seedling survival might contribute to species coexistence.

TI  - Spatial patterning of Wyoming big sagebrush indicates negative density dependence
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Plants reflect resource use in their spatial patterning. Competition for limited resources—such as available soil water in a dryland ecosystem—drives establishment, growth, and mortality, resulting in shifts of spatial arrangement over time. We characterized the spatial patterning of two big sagebrush (<jats:italic>Artemisia tridentata</jats:italic> subspecies <jats:italic>wyomingensis</jats:italic>) communities in the upper Green River Basin of Wyoming, USA. We mapped big sagebrush canopies in two, 100‐m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> sites and calculated plant neighborhoods as the area closer to a target plant than to any other plant. We assumed that neighborhoods were areas in which the target plant dominates resource use. We found that plant neighborhoods had strong, positive correlations with plant size, indicating that larger neighborhoods may access more belowground resources. We also found that the relationships between experienced crowding, that is, crowding index (CI) by an average neighbor, and neighborhood size, were consistently negative regardless of calculation method. We also found that the residuals of a regression of target plant biomass and neighborhood area were strongly related to the CI calculated via all methods. This means that plants with smaller neighborhoods than expected also experience the greatest crowding by an average neighbor. These results are consistent with negative density dependence and show that greater static crowding predicts smaller neighborhoods in two, undisturbed, intermediate‐successional big sagebrush communities. In the future, similar studies of spatial patterning that include interspecific plant–plant interactions will be useful for understanding the relationship between spatial patterning and negative density dependence.</jats:p>

TI  - A test of the Janzen-Connell model with two common tree species in Amazonian forest
PY  - 1997
AB  - Field experiments and survival analysis were used to test whether the Janzen-Connell model operated for two common Amazonian tree species in Peru: the midstorey palm, Astrocaryum murumuru, and the canopy-emergent legume, Dipteryx micrantha. Seed and seedling survival patterns of these species partially supported the model, depending on tree species, type of predator, spatial scale and the particular year. At a small scale of a 2.5-ha plot, Astrocaryum seed predation by insects and mammals was density-dependent. At a larger scale of 100 ha, Dipteryx seed survival increased with distance from conspecific adults, but for Astrocaryum seeds there was no distance dependence. At the scale of 200–400 ha Dipteryx seed survival was negatively related to the number of individuals present in groups of conspecific adult trees. In 1992 a higher proportion of Astrocaryum seedlings survived far from, compared with close to, conspecific adult trees, whilst in 1993 more Dipteryx seedlings survived beneath conspecific adult trees than farther away.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Studies of spatial point patterns (SPPs) are often used to examine the role that density‐dependence (DD) and environmental filtering (EF) play in community assembly and species coexistence in forest communities. However, SPP analyses often struggle to distinguish the opposing effects that DD and EF may have on the distribution of tree species.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We tested percolation threshold analysis on simulated tree communities as a method to distinguish the importance of thinning from DD EF on SPPs. We then compared the performance of percolation threshold analysis results and a Gibbs point process model in detecting environmental associations as well as clustering patterns or overdispersion.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Percolation threshold analysis using simulated SPPs detected a decrease in clustering due to DD and an increase in clustering from EF. In contrast, the Gibbs point process model clearly detected the effects of EF but only identified DD thinning in two of the four types of simulated SPPs. Percolation threshold analysis on the 12 observed tree species' SPPs found that the SPPs for two species were consistent with thinning from DD processes only, four species had SPPs consistent with EF only and SPP for five reflected a combination of both processes. Gibbs models of observed SPPs of living trees detected significant environmental associations for 11 species and clustering consistent with DD processes for seven species.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Percolation threshold analysis is a robust method for detecting community assembly processes in simulated SPPs. By applying percolation threshold analysis to natural communities, we found that tree SPPs were consistent with thinning from both DD and EF.

TI  - Dung beetles as secondary seed dispersers: impact on seed predation and germination
PY  - 1998
AB  - Dispersal of seeds away from the parent plant may facilitate escape from density-dependent seed mortality. However, many post-dispersal events can have a profound influence on the survival of dispersed seeds. By incorporating seeds in the dung that dung beetles process for consumption and oviposition, dung beetles could enhance seed survival if they remove seeds from areas of high pre- dation risk and place them in locations that avoid subsequent predation and that are suitable for germination. The role of dung beetles in seed survival was investig- ated over 15 mo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Depths of seeds buried by beetles, levels of predation on buried and unburied seeds, and germination success of seeds buried to different depths were examined. Results suggest that by burying seeds dung beetles increase the probability that seeds will escape predation and germinate. Of seeds placed in dungpiles, 69% remained at the surface, while 25% were buried from 1-3 cm in depth. Larger seeds were buried more shallowly than smaller seeds. Buried seeds were less likely to be removed by predators than seeds at the surface. Germination of seeds buried at 1- and 3-cm depths was significantly higher than seeds buried at 10 cm. For the species tested, many seeds were buried by dung beetles between 1 and 3 cm and at this depth there was a high probability of escaping predators and germinating. This demonstrates the potential ecological importance of dung beetles in facilitating seed survival and provides data to con- sider the role of dung beetles in the evolution of seed attributes.

TI  - Insect root feeders incur negative density-dependent damage across plant species in an alpine meadow.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Although herbivores are well known to incur positive density-dependent damage and mortality, thereby likely shaping plant community assembly, the response of belowground root feeders to changes in plant density has seldom been addressed. Locally rare plant species (with lower plant biomass per area) are often smaller with shallower roots than common species (with higher plant biomass per area) in competition-intensive grasslands. Likewise, root feeders are often distributed in the upper soil layers. We hypothesized, therefore, that root feeders would incur negative density (biomass)-dependent damage across plant species. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the diversity and abundance of plant and root feeder species in an alpine meadow and determined the diet of the root feeders using metabarcoding. Across all species, root feeder load decreased with increasing aboveground plant biomass, root biomass, and total plant biomass per area, indicating a negative density dependence of damage across plant species. Aboveground plant biomass per area increased with increasing individual plant biomass and root depth per area across species, suggesting that rare plant species were smaller in size and had shallower root systems compared to common plant species. Both root biomass per area and root feeder biomass per area decreased with soil depth, but the root feeder biomass decreased disproportionately faster compared to root biomass with increasing root depth. Root feeder load decreased with increasing root depth but was not correlated with the feeding preference of root feeder species. Moreover, the prediction derived from a random process incorporating vertical distributions of root biomass and root feeder biomass significantly accounted for interspecific variation in root feeder load. In conclusion, the data indicate that root feeders incur negative density-dependent damage across plant species. On this basis, we suggest that manipulative experiments should be conducted to determine the effect of the negative density-dependent damage on plant community structure and that different types of plant-animal interactions should be concurrently examined to fully understand the effect of plant density on overall herbivore damage across plant species.

TI  - Density-dependence and co-existence of conifer and broad-leaved trees in a Japanese northern mixed forest
PY  - 1999
AB  - . The growth and survival of coniferous trees (particularly Abies sachalinensis) and broad-leaved trees (particularly Quercus crispula) were followed over a 15-yr period in a 15.5-ha area in a northern mixed forest in Japan, and the coexistence of the two groups was simulated by a density-dependent projection matrix model. The density-dependent model assumes that the density effect of mother trees due to one-sided competition for light on smaller-sized tree regulates the demographic functions. The mother tree densities of conifers and broad-leaved trees have stronger negative effects on the recruitment and survival of seedlings of their own group than of the other group. These results support the idea of reciprocal replacement for conifer and broad-leaved trees. Simulations using the density-dependent model showed that the two groups will co-exist within a particular range of recruitment rates. However, the density of both groups did not affect the growth rate of any tree, and equilibrium DBH-distributions from density-dependent matrices were quite different from present distributions both for conifers and broad-leaved trees. On the other hand, equilibrium DBH-distributions of conifer and broad-leaved trees from density-independent matrices were quite distinct from each other, reflecting different survivorship curves of the two dominants. These results suggest that density-dependent processes are not so important for shaping population structures in this northern mixed forest.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>A quantitative approach to species coexistence based on the invasibility criterion has led to an appreciation of coexistence mechanisms in terms of stabilizing and equalizing components, but major challenges are the need to consider general multispecies settings, interactions beyond competition, and multiple scales of space and time.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>A general approach to defining average fitnesses and scaling factors is given, along with the origin of stabilizing mechanisms as deviations from a reference model where no coexistence is possible.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Community averages of stabilizing mechanisms reveal overall opportunities for coexistence, and define mechanisms more precisely through their formulae. Average fitnesses adjusted for the presence of coexistence mechanisms provide a better definition of equalizing mechanisms. While these ideas apply to the components of invasion rates, permanence theory and stochastic persistence theory show how invasion rates can be used to demonstrate species coexistence in complex settings.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Although species coexistence has often focused on competition, detailed models of the roles of natural enemies provide a new perspective on the opportunities for coexistence in nature. The concept of apparent competition recognizes the essential symmetry between density‐dependence from resource depletion and from supporting natural enemies. Natural enemy partitioning is the natural analogue of resource partitioning and has an equivalent role in promoting coexistence. Rather than reinforcing each other, however, the strength of coexistence is often intermediate between that implied by resource partitioning alone and that implied by natural enemy partitioning alone, as elucidated by recent Lotka–Volterra theory.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

Although there are alternative approaches for understanding coexistence in multispecies settings, ideas based on stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms continue to provide new insights. Multiple species and multiple trophic levels are naturally challenging, but the new theories of permanence and stochastic persistence support the critical role of invasion rates in species coexistence, and thus support the understanding to be derived by partitioning invasion rates into average fitness differences and stabilizing components.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Nutrients strengthen density dependence of per-capita growth and mortality rates in the soil bacterial community.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Density dependence in an ecological community has been observed in many macro-organismal ecosystems and is hypothesized to maintain biodiversity but is poorly understood in microbial ecosystems. Here, we analyze data from an experiment using quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP) to estimate per-capita growth and mortality rates of bacterial populations in soils from several ecosystems along an elevation gradient which were subject to nutrient addition of either carbon alone (glucose; C) or carbon with nitrogen (glucose + ammonium-sulfate; C + N). Across all ecosystems, we found that higher population densities, quantified by the abundance of genomes per gram of soil, had lower per-capita growth rates in C + N-amended soils. Similarly, bacterial mortality rates in C + N-amended soils increased at a significantly higher rate with increasing population size than mortality rates in control and C-amended soils. In contrast to the hypothesis that density dependence would promote or maintain diversity, we observed significantly lower bacterial diversity in soils with stronger negative density-dependent growth. Here, density dependence was significantly but weakly responsive to nutrients and was not associated with higher bacterial diversity.

TI  - Seed dispersal and seedling recruitment: The missing link(s)
PY  - 1995
AB  - Abstract:Typically seed rain density decreases as a function of distance from the parent plant. Most models of recruitment assume a seed (and a seedling) mortality function monotonically decreasing with distance from the parent (hence, positively density-dependent). This results in either higher recruitment at a distance from the parent (Janzen-Connell model) or near it (Hubbell model), or else a spatially uniform recruitment (exact compensation model), depending upon the specific shape of the mortality function in relation to distance from the parent. However, mortality may increase with distance from the parent (negatively density-dependent) or be spatially uniform, both of those scenarios resulting in a recruitment similar to that predicted by the Hubbell model. Recruitment may also be unpredictable on the sole basis of the parent plant position if mortality is spatially variable and density-independent. For several tree species in a homogeneous cold temperate forest (Houle, 1992a), recruitment could n...

TI  - Do soil-borne fungal pathogens mediate plant diversity–productivity relationships? Evidence and future opportunities
PY  - 2020
AB  - From the establishment of the first biodiversity experiments in the 1990s, studies have consistently reported positive relationships between plant diversity and productivity in grasslands. However, the predominant hypotheses that may explain this pattern have changed. Initially, there was a strong focus on plant–plant interactions such as facilitation and resource partitioning, but the results from the first experiments that manipulated soil communities have led to a paradigm shift. In the current view on mechanisms that drive plant diversity–productivity relationships, fungal pathogen-induced reductions of plant productivity at low diversity play an important role. This role rests on two assumptions: the effects of pathogens (a) are plant-species specific (i.e. not all plant species are affected equally by a fungal pathogen) and (b) display negative density dependence (i.e. decrease with decreasing host plant density and hence, with increasing plant species richness). Here, we review the empirical evidence for these two assumptions. In the biodiversity literature, this is mainly based on indirect approaches, such as soil sterilization, plant–soil feedback studies and plant biomass patterns. The identification and functional characterization of the fungal pathogens that actually drive the plant diversity–productivity relationship have only recently started. Synthesis. Nevertheless, these studies, together with studies on plant–pathogen interactions in agricultural crops and forests, clearly suggest host-specific, negative density-dependent effects of fungal pathogens are common. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the reduced impact of pathogens at high plant diversity depends not just on host density but also on effects of neighbouring (non-host) plant species on the pathogen. Understanding how neighbouring plants affect the interactions between a pathogen and its host plants and disentangling the role of plant–pathogen interactions from other mechanisms potentially driving diversity–productivity relationships are important future challenges.

TI  - Directed seed dispersal towards areas with low conspecific tree density by a scatter‐hoarding rodent
PY  - 2012
AB  - Scatter-hoarding animals spread out cached seeds to reduce density-dependent theft of their food reserves. This behaviour could lead to directed dispersal into areas with lower densities of conspecific trees, where seed and seedling survival are higher, and could profoundly affect the spatial structure of plant communities. We tested this hypothesis with Central American agoutis and Astrocaryum standleyanum palm seeds on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We radio-tracked seeds as they were cached and re-cached by agoutis, calculated the density of adult Astrocaryum trees surrounding each cache, and tested whether the observed number of trees around seed caches declined more than expected under random dispersal. Seedling establishment success was negatively dependent on seed density, and agoutis carried seeds towards locations with lower conspecific tree densities, thus facilitating the escape of seeds from natural enemies. This behaviour may be a widespread mechanism leading to highly effective seed dispersal by scatter-hoarding animals.

TI  - Experimental evidence for an intraspecific Janzen-Connell effect mediated by soil biota
PY  - 2015
AB  - The negative effect of soil pathogens on seedling survival varies considerably among conspecific individuals, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. For variation between heterospecifics, a common explanation is the Janzen-Connell effect: negative density dependence in survival due to specialized pathogens aggregating on common hosts. We test whether an intraspecific Janzen-Connell effect exists, i.e., whether the survival chances of one population's seedlings surrounded by a different conspecific population increase with genetic difference, spatial distance, and trait dissimilarity between them. In a shade-house experiment, we grew seedlings of five populations of each of two subtropical tree species (Castanopsis fissa and Canarium album) for which we measured genetic distance using intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis and eight common traits/characters, and we treated them with soil material or soil biota filtrate collected from different populations. We found that the relative survival rate increased with increasing dissimilarity measured by spatial distance, genetic distance, and trait differences between the seedling and the population around which the soil was collected. This effect disappeared after soil sterilization. Our results provide evidence that genetic variation, trait similarity, and spatial distance can explain intraspecific variation in plant-soil biotic interactions and suggest that limiting similarity also occurs at the intraspecific level.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Negative density dependence (NDD) and niche partitioning have been proposed to explain the species coexistence in plant communities. However, the majority of previous studies have examined either only resource partitioning or NDD, or have focused only on a single life‐history stage. We thus lack knowledge regarding the relative importance of biotic neighbourhood interactions and abiotic conditions on survival at the various life stages of a tree.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Using tree and seedling demographics data, and combined with spatially explicit abiotic and biotic data, we assessed the relative importance of abiotic and biotic variables for survival from the seedling to tree stage in a temperate forest in northeastern China.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We provide strong evidence that both biotic and abiotic neighbourhood variables affect individual survival. We also observed that their relative importance varied with the life‐history stages of a tree. The strength of the effect of conspecific tree neighbours decreases along ontogeny, while the roles of the topographic and edaphic variables increase at later life stages. Heterospecific tree neighbours show consistent negative effects on individual survival at all life stages, yet had the strongest influence on survival at the seedling stage.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We demonstrated that species vary widely in their probability of survival under different environmental conditions, as well as in response to differences in neighbour identity and density. Overall, the effects of conspecific neighbours varied more among species than the effects of heterospecific neighbour density. Wide variation among species in response to abiotic variables is a necessary requirement for niche differentiation and coexistence via resource partitioning processes. Our findings indicate that conspecific NDD and abiotic niche partitioning are major structuring mechanisms in our temperate forest in northeastern China.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Proximity to roads disrupts rodents’ contributions to seed dispersal services and subsequent recruitment dynamics
PY  - 2019
AB  - Seed dispersal and subsequent recruitment dynamics play a crucially important role in regulating species coexistence and structuring tree diversity in diverse forests. Wildlife, which can dually shape the tree recruitment process by simultaneously functioning as natural enemies and seed dispersers, are undergoing widespread changes in population and behaviour due to the detrimental effects of expanding global road networks. However, the impact of these changes on recruitment dynamics through the alteration of seed dispersal processes remains understudied. Here, we assessed how roads affect animal‐mediated recruitment dynamics from the seed to adult stages of trees using a ubiquitous vertebrate‐seed model: rodents and acorns. To quantify the degree to which proximity to a road alters seed dispersal and regulates subsequent recruitment dynamics, we conducted seed dispersal and predation experiments, and investigated the natural recruitment of a dominant tree species (Quercus aliena) from September 2009 to July 2012 in a subtropical forest of central China. Roads caused a decreased seed dispersal distance and increasing larder hoarding, demonstrating a weakened contribution of rodents to seed dispersal services. These patterns were stronger in the masting year than in the non‐masting year. Correspondingly, seedlings, saplings and adult trees had higher densities near roads than far from roads. Near roads, recruit transition rates (i.e. seedling‐to‐sapling and sapling‐to‐juvenile) were low, and the influential strength of conspecific adult density was weakened over these recruit transitions, indicating that space limitation and lottery competition, not conspecific negative density‐dependent effects, approximately determined the near‐road recruitment process. Furthermore, most adults near roads were young, and their ages matched the road ages. Synthesis. Roads diminished animal‐mediated seed dispersal services and disrupted subsequent recruitment dynamics in Quercus aliena populations, thus weakening the key process promoting diversity in forest ecosystems. Given that these animal‐regulated roles in recruitment dynamics are widespread stabilizing forces for tree coexistence, our findings suggest that the ubiquity of roads and their continued expansion will contribute to the increase in forests dominated by a relatively low number of species. Consequently, the growing expansion of road networks will ultimately cause profound changes in community composition and structure across diverse forests worldwide.

AB  - Aim There has been much work on succession over many decades, but succession fundamentals are still debated because of the reliance on chronosequences and dendrochronological reconstruction, both of which are problematic approaches. Here we use time-series data to test four hypotheses that lie at the heart of successional theory: (1) the neighbourhood effect hypothesis – tree species abundance is time dependent; (2) the density-dependence hypothesi s–ar are species is more favoured over time; (3) the resource ratio hypothesis – species that can grow at the lowest resource level tend to dominate resource limited sites through succession; and (4) the intermediate disturbance hypothesis – intermediate disturbances increase the abundance of rare species. Location Central boreal forest in Canada (47°50′–50°10′ N; 80°10′–85°50′ W). Methods We used repeated measurements from sequential aerial photography and ground surveys for 361 fire-origin stands that were measured over a c. 55-year period. Results Shade-intolerant Pinus banksiana decreased, tolerant Thuja occidentalis increased, intolerant Populus spp. and Betula papyrifera displayed a U-shaped trend, and intermediate-tolerant Picea spp. and tolerant Abies balsamea did not change with time since fire, showing evidence of negative, positive, or neutral neighbourhood effects. Species either persisted for longer or increased more in non-conspecific stands, and had higher increases in abundance when associated with species of contrasting shade tolerance, supporting the density-dependence hypothesis and indicating shade-tolerance complementarity as a mechanism for coexistence. Resource-poor soils favoured those species capable of tolerating limited resources, whereas rich soils permitted invasion and promoted mixtures, supporting the resource ratio hypothesis. Intermediate disturbances increased the invasibility of rare species. Main conclusions Contrary to previous studies where time since a standreplacing disturbance is the sole predictor for succession, our study shows that time alone is either an insufficient predictor or is irrelevant to species dynamics in the boreal forest. Rather, density dependence, site resource and intermediate disturbances are key mechanisms in species dynamics and coexistence over time.

TI  - Incorporating the disease triangle framework for testing the effect of soil-borne pathogens on tree species diversity
PY  - 2019
AB  - The enemy‐induced Janzen–Connell (JC) effect, a classic model invoking conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and distance dependence, is a primary biodiversity maintenance hypothesis. Yet, conflicting evidence for the JC effect leads to disagreement about its role in maintaining forest diversity. We focus this review on soil‐borne pathogens, which are the primary agent inducing the JC effect in many forest ecosystems. Although the test of the pathogen‐induced JC effect in ecology critically rests on the seedling mortality caused by soil pathogens, what has not been explicitly explored in the early literature but has increasingly received attention is the long‐recognized fact that the environment can alter virulence of pathogens and host susceptibility (thus pathogen–host interactions), as predicted by the classic disease triangle framework enlightened by pathology research in agricultural systems. Here, following the disease triangle framework we review evidence on how the pathogen‐induced JC effect may be contingent on context (e.g. environmental conditions, pathogen inoculum load and genetic divergence in host and pathogen populations). The reviewed evidence reveals and clarifies the conditions where pathogens may or may not cause disease to hosts, thus contributing to reconciling the inconsistent results about the pathogen‐induced JC effect in the literature. The context dependence of the disease triangle predicts that the pathogen‐induced JC effect would change under global change. Gaining insights from evidence that the pathogen‐induced JC effect is context‐dependent, we suggest that future tests on the JC hypothesis be conducted under the framework of disease triangle, and we stress the necessity by controlling the effect of context factors on plant–pathogen interactions when testing for the JC effect. We conclude the review by proposing three lines of future research for testing the importance of the JC effect in maintaining global forest tree species diversity, with a particular emphasis on testing the effect of global warming on the strength of pathogen–host interactions for better predicting changes of forest biodiversity under climate change. A plain language summary is available for this article.

TI  - Negative density dependence is stronger in resource-rich environments and diversifies communities when stronger for common but not rare species.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence is thought to maintain diversity by limiting abundances of common species. Yet the extent to which this mechanism can explain patterns of species diversity across environmental gradients is largely unknown. We examined density-dependent recruitment of seedlings and saplings and changes in local species diversity across a soil-resource gradient for 38 woody-plant species in a temperate forest. At both life stages, the strength of negative density dependence increased with resource availability, becoming relatively stronger for rare species during seedling recruitment, but stronger for common species during sapling recruitment. Moreover, negative density dependence appeared to reduce diversity when stronger for rare than common species, but increase diversity when stronger for common species. Our results suggest that negative density dependence is stronger in resource-rich environments and can either decrease or maintain diversity depending on its relative strength among common and rare species.

TI  - Distance‐responsive natural enemies strongly influence seedling establishment patterns of multiple species in an Amazonian rain forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary


1. In a faunally intact lowland Amazonian rain forest stand, we conducted a long-term multi-species experiment aimed at determining the primary mechanistic basis of seedling establishment patterns. We deployed a total of 1050 experimental seedlings, representing 11 common tree species in mixed compositions and at fixed, highly elevated densities in shaded understorey sites, representing extremes of distance from large conspecific trees. We used mesh exclosures to isolate the effects of distinct classes of natural enemies, and monitored survival for up to 45 months.



2. Final seedling survival of all species pooled represented a 40% increase at sites located far from (‘F’ sites) versus close to (‘N’ sites) large conspecific trees, and median seedling lifetime was 75% longer. These differences between N and F sites were significant for all species pooled, and for five out of 11 (survivorship) and four out of nine (lifetime) individual species examined. Survival analysis based on multiple censuses revealed that a ‘distance effect’ persisted and intensified over time, with the onset of significant distance-related differential mortality differing amongst species.



3. The use of mesh exclosures ( 2 mm in size appear to have a negative impact on seedling establishment at all distances.



4. No evidence was found for the effect of intra-cohort resource competition on seedling establishment even though initial density of experimental seedlings at all sites was elevated to c. 25 times the mean natural density of the mixed-species seedling layer in this forest.



5. Synthesis. Our study provides strong, multi-species support for the influence of host-specific distance-responsive natural enemies on seedling establishment, and suggests that negative density-dependent patterns of tree recruitment in tropical rain forests are at least partly produced at early life stages as an outcome of processes described by the classic Janzen–Connell model.

TI  - Density-dependent pre-dispersal seed predation and fruit set in a tropical tree.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Negative density-dependent demographic processes operating at post-dispersal seed, seedling, and juvenile stages are the dominant explanation for the coexistence of high numbers of tree species in tropical forests. At adult stages, the effect of pollinators and pre-dispersal fruit predators are often dependent on the density or abundance of flowers and fruit in the canopy, but each have opposite effects on individual realized reproduction. We studied the effect of density on total and mature fruit set and pre-dispersal predation rates within individual tree canopies in a common canopy tree species, Jacaranda copaia in a 50-ha forest census plot in central Panama. We sampled all reproductive sized trees in the plot (n = 188) across three years and estimated fruit set and predation rates. Population-wide pre-dispersal seed predation averaged between 6-37% across years. Using linear mixed effects models, we found that increased density and fecundity of conspecific neighbours increased focal tree fruit set, but also the rate of pre-dispersal predation. An interaction between individual and neighbourhood fruit production predicted lower predation rates at high individual and neighbourhood fecundities, which suggests predator satiation at high fruit abundance levels. However, the rate at which fruit set increased with conspecific neighbour fruit production was greater than the rate at which fruit were lost to predation, resulting in an overall positive effect of neighbour density on mature fruit production in focal trees. Our results run counter to the expectation of a uniformly negative effect of density across all life stages in tropical trees and suggest further exploration of the role of spatial clumping, pollen dispersal limitation, and predation at pre-dispersal adult stages in maintenance of species diversity in plant communities.

TI  - Distance and non-randomness of seed dispersal by the dwarf cassowary Casuarius bennetti
PY  - 1995
AB  - To determine the sources of dispersed seeds I inserted unique tags in fallen Aglaia aff. flavida seeds before dwarf cassowaries (Casuarius bennetti) ate the fruits containing the seeds. Thirty naturally-dispersed, marked seeds were re-located in cassowary droppings in a 400 ha study area. The distribution of seed dispersal distances did not differ significantly from a normal distribution with a mean dispersal distance of 388 m, SD=196.8. Mean distance of dispersed seeds to nearest mature conspecific tree was 170 m, SD=108.4 ; dispersed seeds usually landed closer to other conspecifics than their parent. The estimated distribution of all seeds (including many undispersed seeds) was leptokurtic, creating high densities near source trees (> 0.035 seeds m -2 within 100 m of bole) that quickly tapered off ( 100 m from the bole) ; any density dependent effects are liable to be manifest only near parent trees. Cassowary movement patterns and resting behavior caused non-random dispersal of seeds. Seeds were preferentially moved to level sites uphill from their source trees along routes that did not cross steep terrain. Undispersed seeds generally landed downhill from source trees. This population of Aglaia would probably contract downhill into smaller, fragmented populations in the absence of cassowary-mediated dispersal.

TI  - Wind dispersal and 1‐year survival of <i>Vataireopsis iglesiasii</i> (Fabaceae) seedlings in a Neotropical lowland rain forest
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Populations of many tropical tree species are regulated by negative distance‐ and density‐dependent processes (NDD), yet most studies on the effects of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors on seedling survival have focused on animal‐dispersed species. Species with seeds dispersed by wind may not be moved as far on average as seeds dispersed by animals, but some seeds may be dispersed a lot further, suggesting that knowledge of dispersal mechanism may help in our understanding of NDD. In this study, we took advantage of a high‐fecundity reproductive event that occurred for an individual isolated canopy tree of <jats:italic>Vataireopsis iglesiasii</jats:italic> in a tropical lowland rain forest site in Amazonian Ecuador to document seed dispersal and seedling survival to 1‐year post‐dispersal. Most seeds did not disperse far: 86% of germinated seedlings were found within 100 m. Mortality was high: only 49 of the 1732 monitored seedlings survived one year and only five survived a further four years. We found a significant negative effect of conspecific seedling density (but no effect of distance from the parent tree) on 1‐year survival. Rare long‐distance dispersal events may increase the probability of a seed reaching specific habitats, such as high‐light patches, and surviving beyond one year, thereby shifting the population recruitment curve outwards away from adult trees and maintaining diversity in species‐rich forests.</jats:p><jats:p>Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.</jats:p>

TI  - Simple Mechanisms of Plant Reproductive Benefits Yield Different Dynamics in Pollination and Seed Dispersal Mutualisms.
PY  - 2022
AB  - AbstractPollination and seed dispersal mutualisms are critical for biodiversity and ecosystem services yet face mounting threats from anthropogenic perturbations that cause their populations to decline. Characterizing the dynamics of these mutualisms when populations are at low density is important to anticipate consequences of these perturbations. We developed simple population dynamic models detailed enough to distinguish different mechanisms by which plant populations benefit from animal pollination or seed dispersal. We modeled benefits as functions of foraging rate by animals on plant rewards and specified whether they affected plant seed set, germination, or negative density dependence during recruitment. We found that pollination and seed dispersal mutualisms are stable at high density but exhibit different dynamics at low density, depending on plant carrying capacity, animal foraging efficiency, and whether populations are obligate on their partners for persistence. Under certain conditions, all mutualisms experience destabilizing thresholds in which one population declines because its partner is too rare. Plants additionally experience Allee effects when obligate on pollinators. Finally, pollination mutualisms can exhibit bistable coexistence at low or high density when plants are facultative on pollinators. Insights from our models can inform conservation efforts, as mutualist populations continue to decline globally.

TI  - Negative density dependence characterizes mutualistic interactions between birds and fruiting plants across latitudes.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Negative density dependence (NDD) in biotic interactions of interference such as plant-plant competition, granivory and herbivory are well-documented mechanisms that promote species' coexistence in diverse plant communities worldwide. Here, we investigated the generality of a novel type of NDD mechanism that operates through the mutualistic interactions of frugivory and seed dispersal among fruit-eating birds and plants. By sampling community-wide frugivory interactions at high spatial and temporal resolution in Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, we evaluated whether interaction frequencies between birds and fruit resources occurred more often (selection), as expected, or below expectations (under-utilization) set by the relative fruit abundance of the fruit resources of each plant species. Our models considered the influence of temporal scales of fruit availability and bird phylogeny and diets, revealing that NDD characterizes frugivory across communities. Irrespective of taxa or dietary guild, birds tended to select fruits of plant species that were proportionally rare in their communities, or that became rare following phenological fluctuations, while they mostly under-utilized abundant fruit resources. Our results demonstrate that negative density-dependence in frugivore-plant interactions provides a strong equalizing mechanism for the dispersal processes of fleshy-fruited plant species in temperate and tropical communities, likely contributing to building and sustaining plant diversity. This article is part of the theme issue 'Diversitydependence of dispersal: interspecific interactions determine spatial dynamics'.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Masting, the spatial synchronization of interannual variation in seed production, can enhance reproductive efficiency through positive density‐dependent processes (DD) that result in economies of scale (EOS), such as decreased pollen limitation and predator satiation in years of high reproduction.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>While the general occurrence of such EOS effects has been documented for masting species, few studies simultaneously investigated how spatial and temporal variation in reproduction affects pollination and predation.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we use a long‐term dataset with high spatial resolution of seed production of European beech (<jats:italic>Fagus sylvatica</jats:italic>), Norway spruce (<jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic>), and silver fir (<jats:italic>Abies alba</jats:italic>) in a primeval montane forest to investigate the relationship between reproductive effort, pollination efficiency and predispersal predation by insects.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that, along the temporal axis, the proportion of sound (fertilized and unpredated) seeds correlated positively with annual seed production over the 14‐year study period in all three species, most strongly in beech and only weakly in silver fir.

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>: For both pollination and predispersal predation in beech and spruce, the strongest DD effects occur at low levels of reproduction and quickly reach asymptotes at higher levels, suggesting the presence of thresholds in different EOS mechanisms.

TI  - Experimental and observational evidence of negative conspecific density dependence in temperate ectomycorrhizal trees.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) promotes tree species diversity by reducing recruitment near conspecific adults due to biotic feedbacks from herbivores, pathogens, or competitors. While this process is well-described in tropical forests, tests of temperate tree species range from strong positive to strong negative density dependence. To explain this, several studies have suggested that tree species traits may help predict the strength and direction of density dependence: for example, ectomycorrhizal-associated tree species typically exhibit either positive or weaker negative conspecific density dependence. More generally, the strength of density dependence may be predictably related to other species-specific ecological attributes such as shade tolerance, or the relative local abundance of a species. To test the strength of density dependence and whether it affects seedling community diversity in a temperate forest, we tracked the survival of seedlings of three ectomycorrhizal-associated species experimentally planted beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults on the Prospect Hill tract of the Harvard Forest, in Massachusetts, USA. Experimental seedling survival was always lower under conspecific adults, which increased seedling community diversity in one of six treatments. We compared these results to evidence of CNDD from observed sapling survival patterns of 28 species over approximately 8 years in an adjacent 35-ha forest plot. We tested whether species-specific estimates of CNDD were associated with mycorrhizal association, shade tolerance, and local abundance. We found evidence of significant, negative conspecific density dependence (CNDD) in 23 of 28 species, and positive conspecific density dependence in two species. Contrary to our expectations, ectomycorrhizal-associated species generally exhibited stronger (e.g., more negative) CNDD than arbuscular mycorrhizal-associated species. CNDD was also stronger in more shade-tolerant species but was not associated with local abundance. Conspecific adult trees often have a negative influence on seedling survival in temperate forests, particularly for tree species with certain traits. Here we found strong experimental and observational evidence that ectomycorrhizal-associating species consistently exhibit CNDD. Moreover, similarities in the relative strength of density dependence from experiments and observations of sapling mortality suggest a mechanistic link between negative effects of conspecific adults on seedling and sapling survival and local tree species distributions.

TI  - Interactions, Environmental Sorting and Chance: Phylostructure of a Tropical Forest Assembly
PY  - 2013
AB  - Density dependence, environmental sorting and chance have been discussed for the purpose of understanding, predicting and explaining the species richness, composition and structural parameters of living communities. Different ecological mechanisms occur individually in an overlapping manner, so the structure of each local community is influenced by an independent mixture of these factors. To identify which of these factors prevails in organizing the species-rich tree community from 100 plots of 10 × 10 m in a primary forest patch (the Forest of Seu Nico – FSN, from the Atlantic Forest domain), we analyzed species-environment correlations via canonical correspondence analysis and identified two different pedo-environments. We analyzed the community’s phylogenetic structure using Phylocom 4.2 software to calculate the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Furthermore, we partitioned the total phylogenetic diversity into independent α and β components (ΠST). To reveal the overlap of ecological mechanisms such as neutrality, environmental filtering and density-dependent factors, we analyzed the phylogenetic structure in both pedo-environments. The species-environment correlations observed in the FSN are weak in comparison with those found in other studies, although the permanent plot presents a short environmental gradient, dividing the plot into an upper, more acidic hillside and a lower, more fertile bottom. The overall phylogenetic structure of the FSN community shows strong and significant phylogenetic overdispersion. This overdispersion indicates that density-dependent factors, such as interspecific competition, play an important role in maintaining the species richness and community structure in megadiverse ecosystems such as the FSN when we assume traits to be conserved within evolutionary lineages. The NRI and NTI are correlated positively with the soil pH and negatively with the soil’s aluminum concentration, so the bottom plots show higher phylogenetic overdispersion and lower ΠST values than the hillside plots. This pattern can be explained by the greater importance of environmental filters in more acidic soils that form less favorable habitats, while the influence of competition and therefore also the rate of competitive exclusion are higher in the more favorable, less acidic plots.

TI  - Functional traits of tropical trees and lianas explain spatial structure across multiple scales
PY  - 2017
AB  - Dispersal and density dependence are major determinants of spatial structure, population dynamics and coexistence for tropical forest plants. However, because these two processes can jointly influence spatial structure at similar scales, analysing spatial patterns to separate and quantify them is often difficult.
Species functional traits can be useful indicators of dispersal and density dependence. However, few methods exist for linking functional traits to quantitative estimates of these processes that can be compared across multiple species.
We analysed static spatial patterns of woody plant populations in the 50 ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama with methods that distinguished scale-specific differences in species aggregation. We then tested how these differences related to seven functional traits: growth form, dispersal syndrome, tree canopy layer, adult stature, seed mass, wood density and shade tolerance. Next, we fit analytically tractable spatial moment models to the observed spatial structure of species characterized by similar trait values, which allowed us to estimate relationships of functional traits with the spatial scale of dispersal, and the spatial scale and intensity of negative density dependence.
Our results confirm that lianas are more aggregated than trees, and exhibit increased aggregation within canopy gaps. For trees, increased seed mass, wood density and shade tolerance were associated with less intense negative density dependence, while higher canopy layers and increased stature were associated with decreased aggregation and better dispersal. Spatial structure for trees was also strongly determined by dispersal syndrome. Averaged across all spatial scales, zoochory was more effective than wind dispersal, which was more effective than explosive dispersal. However, at intermediate scales, zoochory was associated with more aggregation than wind dispersal, potentially because of differences in short-distance dispersal and the intensity of negative density dependence.
Synthesis. We develop new tools for identifying significant associations between functional traits and spatial structure, and for linking these associations to quantitative estimates of dispersal scale and the strength and scale of density dependence. Our results help clarify how these processes influence woody plant species on Barro Colorado, and demonstrate how these tools can be applied to other sites and systems.

TI  - Density- and distance-dependent seedling survival in a ballistically dispersed subtropical tree species Philenoptera sutherlandii
PY  - 2008
AB  - We examine the density- and distance-dependent seedling survival of Philenoptera sutherlandii, a common pod-bearing and dehiscent legume (Fabaceae) in Ongoye Forest, South Africa. Short-range ballistic dispersal causes seed to fall beneath the parent tree, where density- or distance-dependent mortality effects are expected to be concentrated. One hundred and eighty marked seedlings were monitored in a 0.5-ha plot containing 30 adults. Our survival data do not support the escape hypothesis. Predation levels declined with increasing seedling density (positive density-dependent survival), but seedling survival after 15 mo was not distance-dependent. Nevertheless, a unimodal (hump-shaped) recruitment curve, typically associated with decreasing seedling density and increasing seedling survival with distance, was observed. In the context of ballistic dispersal, this recruitment curve may indicate a hump-shaped dispersal kernel with predator satiation at high seedling densities near a parent tree. This recruitment curve likely arises because generalized insect seedling predators while attracted to the adult trees also tend to forage farther away. Short dispersal distances, in turn generate the high densities needed to satiate seed and seedling predators. Predator satiation results in long-term survival rates in P. sutherlandii similar to more widely dispersed and less common tree species.

TI  - Negative density dependence of seed dispersal and seedling recruitment in a Neotropical palm
PY  - 2014
AB  - Negative density dependence (NDD) of recruitment is pervasive in tropical tree species. We tested the hypotheses that seed dispersal is NDD, due to intraspecific competition for dispersers, and that this contributes to NDD of recruitment. We compared dispersal in the palm Attalea butyracea across a wide range of population density on Barro Colorado Island in Panama and assessed its consequences for seed distributions. We found that frugivore visitation, seed removal and dispersal distance all declined with population density of A. butyracea, demonstrating NDD of seed dispersal due to competition for dispersers. Furthermore, as population density increased, the distances of seeds from the nearest adult decreased, conspecific seed crowding increased and seedling recruitment success decreased, all patterns expected under poorer dispersal. Unexpectedly, however, our analyses showed that NDD of dispersal did not contribute substantially to these changes in the quality of the seed distribution; patterns with population density were dominated by effects due solely to increasing adult and seed density.

TI  - Spatial patterns of trees and structuring factors in a Trachypogon savanna of the Orinoco Llanos
PY  - 1991
AB  - Tree dispersion was evaluated in a Trachypogon savanna by measuring the distance from individual trees to their nearest conspecific neighbor. The vegetation is a closed bush island savanna with coexistent isolated trees and small patches of semideciduous forest. The isolated trees were in clumps similar to trees growing in savannas and tropical forests. In our study, adults were less clumped compared to juveniles. Environmental and biotic differences related to edaphic heterogeneity, life history, and reproductive strategy could account for the clumped pattern. Different spatial patterns emerged for stems in groves. Thus, uniform spatial distribution was evident in the individuals of the fire resistant species (Curatella americana, Byrsonima crassifolia and Bowdichia virgilioides) and a gap filling species (Casearia decandra). Changes in the demographic components between different age groups provide evidence for density-dependent mortality. A hypothesis mainly based on two scales of disturbance (human impact and gap formation) acting synergetically with a large scale factor (substrate patchiness) is put forward to explain the dynamics of tree invasion and the maintenance of the Trachypogon savanna.

TI  - Evidence for effective seed dispersal by the Sulawesi red-knobbed hornbill, Aceros cassidix
PY  - 1998
AB  - The Sulawesi red-knobbed hornbill (Aceros cassidix) is a large-bodied, frugivorous bird that nests in high densities in the Tangkoko-DuaSudara Nature Reserve, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. I measured seedling abundance and species richness, diversity, and dominance in plots placed below and immediately behind 20 active nest sites to evaluate the role of red-knobbed hornbills as agents of seed dispersal. Comparisons of treatment (below nests) and control plots (behind nests) show that hornbills affect the abundance and distribution of diet-species seedlings. Nondiet and nest tree seedlings did not differ between control and treatment plots suggesting that differences in diet species were the result of additional input by hornbills rather than by random or other dispersal events. Significantly greater numbers of diet seedlings germinated below nests, and the diversity of diet species was greater than that of nondiet species. Dominance of a few species in the treatment plots is consistent with the hypothesis that hornbills are effectively dispersing seeds of some, but not all, of their diet species. Although seedlings under nests may eventually experience density-dependent mortality, seedlings survived at least 12 months, indicating that red-knobbed hornbills were effectively dispersing seeds and influencing the initial fate of seeds of several tropical forest tree species.

ABSTRAK

Rangkong Sulawesi (Aceros cassidix) adalah jenis burung frugivora yang hidup dan bersarang dengan kepadatan tinggi di Cagar Alam Tangkoko-DuaSudara Sulawesi Utara, Indonesia. Untuk megetahui peran rangkong Sulawesi dalam proses penyebaran biji, telah dilakukan penelitian tentang kelimpahan semai dan kekayaan jenis serta keanekaragaman dan dominansi dari jenis-jenis pohon bukan pakan dan pohon pakan rangkong. Penghitungan dilakukan pada plot-plot yang dibuat tepat di bawah dan di belakang 20 pohon sarang yang masih aktif. Perbandingan antara plot di bawah sarang (perlakuan) dan di belakang sarang (kontrol) memperlihatkan bahwa rangkong Sulawesi mempengaruhi kelimpahan dan distribusi semai jenis pohon pakan. Tidak adanya perbedaan untuk semai jenis bukan pohon pakan dan jenis pohon sarang antara plot perlakuan dan kontrol, menunjukkan bahwa perbedaan untuk jenis pohon pakan di kedua plot terjadi lebih karena pengaruh rangkong daripada peristiwa penyebaran biji lainnya. Jumlah biji pohon pakan yang berkecambah di bawah sarang dan keanekaragamannya, ternyata lebih tinggi daripada jenis pohon bukan pakan. Adanya dominansi beberapa jenis pohon di bawah sarang tersebut sesuai dengan hipotesa bahwa rangkong secara efektif menyebarkan biji beberapa jenis pohon pakannya. Walaupun pada akhirnya sebagian semai di bawah sarang akan mati akibat kepadatan yang tinggi, namun semai tersebut dapat bertahan sedikitnya selama 12 bulan. Hal itu menunjukkan bahwa rangkong Sulawesi secara efektif ikut menyebarkan biji dan mempengaruhi awal kehidupan beberapa jenis pohon hutan tropis.

TI  - Density-dependent seedling mortality varies with light availability and species abundance in wet and dry Hawaiian forests
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary
Conspecific density may contribute to patterns of species assembly through negative density dependence (NDD) as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, or through facilitation (positive density dependence; PDD). Conspecific density effects are expected to be more negative in darker and wetter environments due to higher pathogen abundance and more positive in stressful, especially dry, environments (stress-gradient hypothesis). For NDD to contribute to maintaining diversity, it should be apparent at the community-wide scale as a negative correlation between seedling recruitment, growth or survival and conspecific adult abundance (community compensatory trend; CCT).
We examined seedling survival in relation to con- and heterospecific adults within 10 m and con- and heterospecific seedlings within 1 m for 13 species within two 4-ha permanent plots located in dry and wet forests in Hawaii. We also examined interactions between conspecific density and light and species’ commonness.
For all species pooled, adult conspecific effects were positive (PDD) in both dry and wet forests, though they were stronger in the dry forest. In contrast, seedling conspecific effects were negative (NDD), though only significantly so in the wet forest.
The strength and direction of density effects varied with understorey light such that seedlings had the highest survival where both adult conspecific density and light were high but the lowest survival where seedling conspecific density and light were high.
In the wet forest, the most common species showed positive effects of adult conspecifics, but the less common species showed negative adult conspecific effects. We found mixed evidence for a CCT: seedling survival was positively correlated with basal area, but negatively correlated with tree density (stems ha−1). Thus, it remains unclear whether NDD is a diversity-maintaining mechanism in these forests.
Synthesis. Overall, we found that positive conspecific effects influenced seedling mortality patterns more than negative interactions did, even in tropical wet forest where NDD is predicted to drive species’ abundances. Additionally, the strength and direction of density effects varied with forest type, PAR, and species’ abundance, underscoring the need to consider abiotic factors and species’ life-history traits in tests of density dependence hypotheses.

TI  - Assessment of spatial discordance of primary and effective seed dispersal of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) by ecological and genetic methods.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Spatial discordance between primary and effective dispersal in plant populations indicates that postdispersal processes erase the seed rain signal in recruitment patterns. Five different models were used to test the spatial concordance of the primary and effective dispersal patterns in a European beech (Fagus sylvatica) population from central Spain. An ecological method was based on classical inverse modelling (SSS), using the number of seed/seedlings as input data. Genetic models were based on direct kernel fitting of mother-to-offspring distances estimated by a parentage analysis or were spatially explicit models based on the genotype frequencies of offspring (competing sources model and Moran-Clark's Model). A fully integrated mixed model was based on inverse modelling, but used the number of genotypes as input data (gene shadow model). The potential sources of error and limitations of each seed dispersal estimation method are discussed. The mean dispersal distances for seeds and saplings estimated with these five methods were higher than those obtained by previous estimations for European beech forests. All the methods show strong discordance between primary and effective dispersal kernel parameters, and for dispersal directionality. While seed rain was released mostly under the canopy, saplings were established far from mother trees. This discordant pattern may be the result of the action of secondary dispersal by animals or density-dependent effects; that is, the Janzen-Connell effect.

TI  - Aggregated Seed Dispersal by Spider Monkeys Limits Recruitment to Clumped Patterns in Virola calophylla
PY  - 2004
AB  - The initial spatial pattern of seed deposition influences plant population and community structure, particularly when that pattern persists through recruitment. In a vertebratedispersed rain forest tree, Virola calophylla, we found that spatially aggregated seed deposition strongly influenced the spatial structure of later stages. Seed dispersion was clumped, and seed densities were highest underneath V. calophylla females and the sleeping sites of spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus), the key dispersal agent. Although these site types had the lowest per capita seed-to-seedling survival, they had the highest seedling/sapling densities. Conversely, seed and seedling/sapling densities were lowest, and seed survival was highest, at sites of diurnal seed dispersal by spider monkeys. Negative density-dependent and positive distance-dependent seed survival thinned seed clumps. Nonetheless, the clumped dispersion at sleeping and parental sites persisted to the seedling/sapling stage because differences in seed deposition were large enough to offset differences in seed survival among these site types.

TI  - Stochastically driven adult-recruit associations of tree species on Barro Colorado Island.
PY  - 2014
AB  - The spatial placement of recruits around adult conspecifics represents the accumulated outcome of several pattern-forming processes and mechanisms such as primary and secondary seed dispersal, habitat associations or Janzen–Connell effects. Studying the adult–recruit relationship should therefore allow the derivation of specific hypotheses on the processes shaping population and community dynamics. We analysed adult–recruit associations for 65 tree species taken from six censuses of the 50 ha neotropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We used point pattern analysis to test, at a range of neighbourhood scales, for spatial independence between recruits and adults, to assess the strength and type of departure from independence, and its relationship with species properties. Positive associations expected to prevail due to dispersal limitation occurred only in 16% of all cases; instead a majority of species showed spatial independence (≈73%). Independence described the placement of recruits around conspecific adults in good approximation, although we found weak and noisy signals of species properties related to seed dispersal. We hypothesize that spatial mechanisms with strong stochastic components such as animal seed dispersal overpower the pattern-forming effects of dispersal limitation, density dependence and habitat association, or that some of the pattern-forming processes cancel out each other.

TI  - DENSITY DEPENDENCE VS. INDEPENDENCE, AND IRREGULAR POPULATION DYNAMICS OF A SWALLOW‐WORT FRUIT FLY
PY  - 2007
AB  - Although most long-term studies of consumer-resource (e.g., predator-prey) interactions select species showing cyclic population dynamics, strong consumer-resource interactions can also produce irregular, noncyclic dynamics. Here, we present a case in which a seed predator, the tephritid fruit fly Euphranta connexa, shows fluctuations in density of more than two orders of magnitude over a 22-year period. To explain these fluctuations, we analyzed a stage-specific data set to quantify the density-dependent and density-independent components of larval survivorship and realized fecundity. Both larval survivorship and realized fecundity were strongly density dependent. Larval survivorship dropped from 0.62 at low larval density to 0.081 at high larval density, whereas fecundity dropped from 84.3 to 0.32 eggs per individual, more than a 100-fold decrease. We divided density-independent variation in E. connexa population dynamics into components for variability in (1) larval survivorship, (2) realized fecundity, and (3) annual fruit abundance. Of these components, 96% of the density-independent variance in per capita population growth rates was caused by fluctuations in fruit abundance. This highlights the importance of the strong consumer-resource interactions in driving fluctuations in E. connexa abundance. It also demonstrates that E. connexa dynamics are remarkably simple, and aside from the 4% of unexplained variance in per capita population growth rates, our understanding of E. connexa dynamics is remarkably complete.

TI  - Local neighborhood and species' shade tolerance influence survival in a diverse seedling bank.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that negative density dependence, particularly at early life stages, is widespread in plant communities. We hypothesized that survival in forest seedling banks declines with increasing density of conspecific neighbors and that local-scale effects cause a negative correlation between seedling survival and tree species abundance in the community. We tested these hypotheses using data on 48 956 established seedlings of 235 species over three years in a 50-ha plot in Panama. For all species combined, we found a significant negative effect of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors within 10 m. In species-level analyses, neighbor density affected survival for 45 of 59 species, with effects of conspecifics different from heterospecifics for 29 species. Despite negative effects of local conspecific neighbors, seedling survival tended to be positively correlated with species abundance at the 50-ha scale. However, when accounting for species' shade tolerance, we found a significant ...

TI  - Demography of a Savanna Palm Tree: Predictions from Comprehensive Spatial Pattern Analyses
PY  - 1999
AB  - Existing statistical methods for spatial pattern analysis now permit precise analyses of patterns and, given the appropriate interpretation keys, the formulation of testable hypotheses about the underlying processes. From a comprehensive analysis of the spatial pattern of a plant population and its environment, we infer scenarios of links between demographic processes, plant spatial patterns, and environmental heterogeneity. The palm tree Borassus aethiopum has easily identifiable demographic stages, a root foraging strategy enabling adults to reach distant nutrient sources, and a marked senescence starting with the onset of reproduction. We analyzed map data for palm individuals (in three different life history stages plus two sexes for adults) and for nutrient-rich patches (clumps of other tree species and termite mounds) in three vegetation types (facies) of a humid savanna of West Africa (Lamto, Ivory Coast). Spatial analyses were based on Diggle’s nearest neighbor functions F and G and on Ripley’s K function. The main results were as follows: (1) juveniles and seedlings are aggregated, while adults have a random pattern or are more loosely aggregated; (2) all stages except female adults are spatially associated with nutrient-rich patches, but association distances increase with stage in the life cycle; and (3) seedlings are associated with female adults, whereas the association of juveniles at longer distances is not clear-cut. We propose from these results a parsimonious scenario linking spatial pattern and mortality pattern during the life cycle. The initial pattern of seedlings (close to maternal trees) results from low dispersal distance. Later stages (older seedlings and juveniles) are mostly restricted to nutrient-rich patches through nutrient shortage away from these patches (environment-induced mortality) and form dense clumps of immature palms. Competition on nutrient-rich patches then favors the few juveniles that manage to survive farther from these patches (density-dependent mortality). Finally, the last surviving juvenile of a clump suddenly experiences almost no competition with conspecifics, due to the long distance between clumps of juveniles, and owing to its root-foraging ability, it can now recruit to the adult stage, subject only to senescence. Pattern variations among savanna facies are consistent with this scenario.

TI  - Conspecific and phylogenetic density-dependent survival differs across life stages in a tropical forest
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary
Ecologists have long recognized that plant performance is affected by the density and composition of neighbouring individuals. With the advent of highly resolved species-level phylogenies, it has become possible to test whether such density-dependent neighbourhood interactions are also phylogenetically dependent. Most studies of density dependence have focused on a single life stage; however, the relative importance of different neighbourhood interactions may shift over the lifetime of an individual.
We examined effects of conspecific neighbour density, heterospecific neighbour density and average phylogenetic relatedness of heterospecific neighbours on the survival of seedlings, saplings, juveniles and adult trees of 29 focal tree species using long-term, spatially explicit forest dynamics data and a highly resolved DNA barcode phylogeny from the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama.
Our results show a decline in the strength of conspecific negative density dependence across life stages: strong negative conspecific neighbour effects at early life stages gave way to weak positive conspecific neighbour effects for adult trees. In contrast, the effect of heterospecific neighbour density on survival showed no clear trend with life stage.
We found evidence of phylogenetic density dependence in the BCI forest, with a significant negative impact of neighbourhood relatedness on focal tree survival, but only for later life stages. In contrast to studies from other tropical forests, neighbourhood relatedness had a significant positive effect on seedling survival.
Furthermore, we found that focal species varied much more widely in their sensitivity to conspecific neighbour density than in their reactions to heterospecific neighbour density or phylogenetic relatedness.
Synthesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that both conspecific density dependence and phylogenetic density dependence influence tropical tree survival, but that their relative importance varies with life stage and among species. Our study highlights the need to incorporate multiple life stages and multiple species when assessing the factors contributing to individual survival and species coexistence for long-lived organisms.

TI  - Demographic consequences of heterogeneity in conspecific density dependence among mast-fruiting tropical trees
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>
            The role of conspecific density dependence (CDD) in the maintenance of species richness is a central focus of tropical forest ecology. However, tests of CDD often ignore the integrated effects of CDD over multiple life stages and their long-term impacts on population demography. We combined a 10-year time series of seed production, seedling recruitment and sapling and tree demography of three dominant Southeast Asian tree species that adopt a mast-fruiting phenology. We used these data to construct individual-based models that examine the effects of CDD on population growth rates (
            <jats:italic>λ</jats:italic>
            ) across life-history stages. Recruitment was driven by positive CDD for all species, supporting the predator satiation hypothesis, while negative CDD affected seedling and sapling growth of two species, significantly reducing
            <jats:italic>λ</jats:italic>
            . This negative CDD on juvenile growth overshadowed the positive CDD of recruitment, suggesting the cumulative effects of CDD during seedling and sapling development has greater importance than the positive CDD during infrequent masting events. Overall, CDD varied among positive, neutral and negative effects across life-history stages for all species, suggesting that assessments of CDD on transitions between just two stages (e.g. seeds seedlings or juveniles mature trees) probably misrepresent the importance of CDD on population growth and stability.

TI  - Forest tree neighborhoods are structured more by negative conspecific density dependence than by interactions among closely related species
PY  - 2017
AB  - Interactions among neighbors influence the structure of communities of sessile organisms. Closely related species tend to share habitat and resource requirements and to interact with the same mutualists and natural enemies so that the strength of interspecific interactions tends to decrease with evolutionary divergence time. Nevertheless, the degree to which such phylogenetically related ecological interactions structure plant communities remains unclear. Using data from five large mapped forest plots combined with a DNA barcode mega-phylogeny, we employed an individual-based approach to assess the collective effects of focal tree size on neighborhood phylogenetic relatedness. Abundance-weighted average divergence time for all neighbors (ADT_all) and for heterospecific neighbors only (ADT_hetero) were calculated for each individual of canopy tree species. Within local neighborhoods, we found phylogenetic composition changed with focal tree size. Specifically, significant increases in ADT_all with focal tree size were evident at all sites. In contrast, there was no significant change in ADT_hetero with tree size in four of the five sites for both sapling-sized and all neighbors, even at the smallest neighbourhood scale (0–5 m), suggesting a limited role for phylogeny-dependent interactions. However, there were inverse relationships between focal tree size and the proportion of heterospecific neighbors belonging to closely related species at some sites, providing evidence for negative phylogenetic density dependence. Overall, our results indicate that negative interaction with conspecifics had a much greater impact on neighborhood assemblages than interactions among closely related species and could contribute to community structure and diversity maintenance in different forest communities.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We used detailed census data from the fully mapped 30‐ha Mo Singto forest dynamics plot in Thailand together with spatial point pattern analysis to find out if the local species richness of small (dbh &lt;10 cm) and large (dbh ≥10 cm) trees in the neighbourhood of large trees of 52 focal species was larger or smaller than expected by an appropriate null model.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We then used binary data (+ or 0) on the seed dispersal network at the Mo Singto plot to test the hypothesis that the major primate frugivores, rather than other arboreal frugivores, generated patterns of locally increased species richness around their preferred diet species (i.e. accumulator effects).</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>More than half of the focal species showed accumulator effects with respect to species richness of small trees (&lt;10 cm in diameter), but accumulator effects with respect to large trees were weak and not consistent with those of small trees.

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our analysis suggests that primates—as major drivers of contagious seed dispersal—generate species‐rich seed rain around their preferred food‐tree species, which results in significantly larger local species richness of saplings.

Hence, extirpation of primates may result in significant changes in the diversity and spatial structure of tropical forests.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Physical, but not chemical, antiherbivore defense expression is related to the clustered spatial distribution of tropical trees in an Amazonian forest.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The conspecific negative density dependence hypothesis states that mortality of young trees (seedlings and saplings) is higher near conspecific adults due to mechanisms such as allelopathy, intraspecific competition, and pest facilitation, explaining why in the tropics, most of plant species tend to be rare and live dispersed. However, there are some tree species that defy this expectation and grow in large clusters of conspecific juveniles and adults. We hypothesize that conspecifics living in clusters show higher and/or more variable defensive profiles than conspecifics with dispersed distributions.We evaluated our hypothesis by assessing the expression of physical leaf traits (thickness, and the resistance to punch, tear and shear) and leaf chemical defenses for six clustered and six non-clustered tree species in Yasuni National Park, Ecuadorian Amazon. We ask ourselves whether (a) clustered species have leaves with higher physical resistance to damage and more chemical defenses variability than non-clustered species; (b) saplings of clustered species may show higher physical resistance to damage and higher variation on chemical leaf defenses than their conspecific adults, and (c) saplings of non-clustered species show lower resistance to physical damage and lower variation in chemical defenses compared to conspecific adults.Overall, our study did not support any of our hypotheses. Remarkably, we found that soluble metabolites were significantly species-specific.Our study suggests that plants physical but not chemical leaf antiherbivore defenses may be a crucial strategy for explaining survivorship of clustered species. Trees in Yasuni may also fall along a suite of tolerance/escape/defense strategies based on limitations of each species physiological constraints for survival and establishment. We conclude that other mechanisms, such as those related to indirect defenses, soil nutrient exploitation efficiency, volatile organic compounds, delayed leaf-greening, and seed dispersal mechanisms, shall be evaluated to understand conspecific coexistence in this forest.

TI  - Consumer Fronts, Global Change, and Runaway Collapse in Ecosystems
PY  - 2013
AB  - Consumer fronts occur when grazers or predators aggregate in bands along the edges of a resource. Our review reveals that consumer fronts are a common phenomenon in nature, occur in many different ecosystems, and are triggered by universal mechanisms: External forces locally increase top-down control beyond prey carrying and/or renewal capacity, and resource-dependent movement leads to consumer aggregation along the edge of the remaining prey population. Once formed, consumer fronts move through systems as spatially propagating waves, self-reinforced via intense overexploitation and amplified by density-dependent feedbacks. When consumer fronts are spatially restricted, they generate patchiness. In contrast, when consumer fronts are expansive, they can lead to runaway responses that cause large-scale ecosystem degradation and regime shifts. We conceptualize a synergistic stress hypothesis and model that highlight how coupled intensification of physical stress and enhanced consumer pressure can trigger inc...

TI  - Long-distance dispersal helps germinating mahogany seedlings escape defoliation by a specialist caterpillar
PY  - 2009
AB  - Herbivores and pathogens with acute host specificity may promote high tree diversity in tropical forests by causing distance- and density-dependent mortality of seedlings, but evidence is scarce. Although Lepidoptera larvae are the most abundant and host-specific guild of herbivores in these forests, their impact upon seedling distributions remains largely unknown. A firm test of the mechanism underpinning the Janzen-Connell hypothesis is difficult, even for a single tree species, because it requires more than just manipulating seeds and seedlings and recording their fates. Experimental tests require: (1) an insect herbivore that is identified and highly specialised, (2) linkage to an in situ measure (or prevention) of herbivory, and (3) evaluation and confirmation among many conspecific adult trees across years. Here we present experimental evidence for a spatially explicit interaction between newly germinating seedlings of a Neotropical emergent tree, big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, Meliaceae), and caterpillars of a noctuid moth (Steniscadia poliophaea). In the understory of a southeastern Amazon forest, the proportion of attacks, leaf area lost, and seedling mortality due to this specialised herbivore peaked near Swietenia trees, but declined significantly with increasing distance from mature fruiting trees, as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We conclude that long-distance dispersal events (>50 m) provided an early survival advantage for Swietenia seedlings, and propose that the role of larval Lepidoptera as Janzen-Connell vectors may be underappreciated in tropical forests.

TI  - Density-dependent survival varies with species life-history strategy in a tropical forest.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Species coexistence in diverse communities likely results from multiple interacting factors. Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities.

TI  - Shifts in species and phylogenetic diversity between sapling and tree communities indicate negative density dependence in a lowland rain forest
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. As trees in a given cohort progress through ontogeny, many individuals die. This risk of mortality is unevenly distributed across species because of many processes such as habitat filtering, interspecific competition and negative density dependence. Here, we predict and test the patterns that such ecological processes should inscribe on both species and phylogenetic diversity as plants recruit from saplings to the canopy. 2. We compared species and phylogenetic diversity of sapling and tree communities at two sites in French Guiana. We surveyed 2084 adult trees in four 1-ha tree plots and 943 saplings in sixteen 16-m 2 subplots nested within the tree plots. Species diversity was measured using Fisher’s alpha (species richness) and Simpson’s index (species evenness). Phylogenetic diversity was measured using Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic richness) and Rao’s quadratic entropy index (phylogenetic evenness). The phylogenetic diversity indices were inferred using four phylogenetic hypotheses: two based on rbcLa plastid DNA sequences obtained from the inventoried individuals with different branch lengths, a global phylogeny available from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and a combination of both. 3. Taxonomic identification of the saplings was performed by combining morphological and DNA barcoding techniques using three plant DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, rpoC1 and rbcLa). DNA barcoding enabled us to increase species assignment and to assign unidentified saplings to molecular operational taxonomic units. 4. Species richness was similar between saplings and trees, but in about half of our comparisons, species evenness was higher in trees than in saplings. This suggests that negative density dependence plays an important role during the sapling-to-tree transition. 5. Phylogenetic richness increased between saplings and trees in about half of the comparisons. Phylogenetic evenness increased significantly between saplings and trees in a few cases (4 out of 16) and only with the most resolved phylogeny. These results suggest that negative density dependence operates largely independently of the phylogenetic structure of communities. 6. Synthesis. By contrasting species richness and evenness across size classes, we suggest that negative density dependence drives shifts in composition during the sapling-to-tree transition. In addition, we found little evidence for a change in phylogenetic diversity across age classes, suggesting that the observed patterns are not phylogenetically constrained.

TI  - Seed density affects post‐dispersal seed predation: evidence from a seed removal experiment of 62 species
PY  - 2020
AB  - Post-dispersal seed predation plays an important role in plant demography and biodiversity maintenance. However, the effects of seed density on seed predation from previous studies have been inconsistent. We dissected the effects of density on the 2-step processes of seed predation using 101 520 seeds from 62 plant species in an alpine pine forest for 3 consecutive years. In this study we explained the current controversy surrounding the effects of density on seed predation. Seed encounter frequency (at least 1 seed being predated from an experiment depot) showed positive density dependence, while seed exploitation (the proportion of seeds being predated of the encountered depots) showed negative density dependence. Both density effects showed a consistent trend but with different magnitudes of effect across years. Final seed predation is the combination of seed encounter and seed exploitation. Final seed predation could be either positively or negatively density-dependent and was contingent on the magnitude of the difference between positive density-dependent seed encounter and negative density-dependent seed exploitation. Our results also indicated that studies including only a few species would produce biased results, because the density effect on seed predation differed greatly among plant species. Future studies should include a large number of plant species that possess a wide range of diverse seed traits to avoid potential bias and produce more comprehensive and accurate results.

TI  - Are we missing the forest for the trees? Conspecific negative density dependence in a temperate deciduous forest.
PY  - 2021
AB  - One of the central goals of ecology is to determine the mechanisms that enable coexistence among species. Evidence is accruing that conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), the process by which plant seedlings are unable to survive in the area surrounding adults of their same species, is a major contributor to tree species coexistence. However, for CNDD to maintain community-level diversity, three conditions must be met. First, CNDD must maintain diversity for the majority of the woody plant community (rather than merely specific groups). Second, the pattern of repelled recruitment must increase in with plant size. Third, CNDD should extend to the majority of plant life history strategies. These three conditions are rarely tested simultaneously. In this study, we simultaneously test all three conditions in a woody plant community in a North American temperate forest. We examined whether understory and canopy woody species across height categories and dispersal syndromes were overdispersed-a spatial pattern indicative of CNDD-using spatial point pattern analysis across life history stages and strategies. We found that there was a strong signal of overdispersal at the community level. Across the whole community, larger individuals were more overdispersed than smaller individuals. The overdispersion of large individuals, however, was driven by canopy trees. By contrast, understory woody species were not overdispersed as adults. This finding indicates that the focus on trees for the vast majority of CNDD studies may have biased the perception of the prevalence of CNDD as a dominant mechanism that maintains community-level diversity when, according to our data, CNDD may be restricted largely to trees.

TI  - Stage-structured ontogeny in resource populations generates non-additive stabilizing and de-stabilizing forces in populations and communities
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>Demographic heterogeneity influences how populations respond to density dependent intraspecific competition and trophic interactions. Distinct stages across an organism's development, or ontogeny, are an important example of demographic heterogeneity. In consumer populations, ontogenetic stage structure has been shown to produce categorical differences in population dynamics, community dynamics and even species coexistence compared to models lacking explicit ontogeny. The study of consumer–resource interactions must also consider the ontogenetic stage structure of the resource itself, particularly plants, given their fundamental role at the basis of terrestrial food webs. We incorporate distinct ontogenetic stages of plants into an adaptable multi‐stage consumer–resource modeling framework that facilitates studying how stage specific consumers shape trophic dynamics at low trophic levels. We describe the role of density dependent demographic rates in mediating the dynamics of stage‐structured plant populations. We then investigate how these demographic rates interact with consumer pressure to influence stability and coexistence in multiple stage‐specific consumer–resource interactions. Results detail how density dependent effects across distinct ontogenetic stages in plant development produce non‐additivity in the drivers of dynamic stability both in single populations and in consumer–resource settings, challenging the ubiquity of certain traditional ecological dynamic paradigms. We also find categorical differences in the population variability induced by herbivores consuming separate plant stages. Consumer–resource models, such as plant–herbivore interactions, often average out demographic heterogeneity in populations. Here, we show that explicitly including plant demographic heterogeneity through ontogeny yields distinct dynamic expectations for both plants and herbivores compared to traditional consumer–resource formulations. Our results indicate that efforts to understand the demographic effect of herbivores on plant populations may need to also consider the effects of plant demographics on herbivores and the reciprocal relationship between them.</jats:p>

TI  - SPECIES-AREA AND SPECIES-INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS FOR TROPICAL TREES : A COMPARISON OF THREE 50-HA PLOTS
PY  - 1996
AB  - 1 Species-accumulation curves for woody plants were calculated in three tropical forests, based on fully mapped 50-ha plots in wet, old-growth forest in Peninsular Malaysia, in moist, old-growth forest in central Panama, and in dry, previously logged forest in southern India. A total of 610 000 stems were identified to species and mapped to < Im accuracy. Mean species number and stem number were calculated in quadrats as small as 5 m x 5 m to as large as 1000 m x 500 m, for a variety of stem sizes above 10 mm in diameter. Species-area curves were generated by plotting species number as a function of quadrat size; species-individual curves were generated from the same data, but using stem number as the independent variable rather than area.

2 Species-area curves had different forms for stems of different diameters, but species-individual curves were nearly independent of diameter class. With < 10(4) stems, species-individual curves were concave downward on log-log plots, with curves from different forests diverging, but beyond about 104 stems, the log-log curves became nearly linear, with all three sites having a similar slope. This indicates an asymptotic difference in richness between forests: the Malaysian site had 2.7 times as many species as Panama, which in turn was 3.3 times as rich as India.

3 Other details of the species-accumulation relationship were remarkably similar between the three sites. Rectangular quadrats had 5-27% more species than square quadrats of the same area, with longer and narrower quadrats increasingly diverse. Random samples of stems drawn from the entire 50 ha had 10-30% more species than square quadrats with the same number of stems. At both Pasoh and BCI, but not Mudumalai. species richness was slightly higher among intermediate-sized stems (50-100mm in diameter) than in either smaller or larger sizes, These patterns reflect aggregated distributions of individual species, plus weak density-dependent forces that tend to smooth the species abundance distribution and 'loosen' aggregations as stems grow.

4 The results provide support for the view that within each tree community, many species have their abundance and distribution guided more by random drift than deterministic interactions. The drift model predicts that the species-accumulation curve will have a declining slope on a log-log plot, reaching a slope of O.1 in about 50 ha. No other model of community structure can make such a precise prediction.

5 The results demonstrate that diversity studies based on different stem diameters can be compared by sampling identical numbers of stems. Moreover, they indicate that stem counts < 1000 in tropical forests will underestimate the percentage difference in species richness between two diverse sites. Fortunately, standard diversity indices (Fisher's sc, Shannon-Wiener) captured diversity differences in small stem samples more effectively than raw species richness, but both were sample size dependent. Two nonparametric richness estimators (Chao. jackknife) performed poorly, greatly underestimating true species richness.

TI  - Effect of Inflorescence‐Feeding Insects on the Demography and Lifetime of a Native Plant
PY  - 1995
AB  - The importance of herbivorous insects for plant demography and fitness is still controversial. The fact that their effect has not been fully evaluated within the context of the complete plant life cycle contributes to this controversy. This study is the first to test directly the influence of flower and seed consumption by a guild of inflorescence- feeding insects on the demography and fitness of a native plant over its whole life cycle within its natural environment. First, we discuss the evidence required to assess the effect of inflorescence-feeding insects on sequential stages in the plant life cycle. Then, we present the detailed results of two experiments that quantify the effect of inflorescence-feeding insects on seeds, seedlings, juveniles, and subsequent flowering progeny of Cirsium ca- nescens (Platte thistle), a native, monocarpic perennial species of Sandhills prairie, Ne- braska. Exclusion of inflorescence-feeding insects by insecticide had four main effects. Total seed output increased (P < 0.0005 in both experiments), indicating that resources were not limiting seed production. Flower heads produced later in the season contributed to the seed pool when insects were reduced (P < 0.01), suggesting that insect feeding restricted the phenology of flowering and pollination. The density of seedlings increased around plants protected from inflorescence-feeding insects (P < 0.0005), showing that safe sites were not limiting. Finally, the increase in seedlings led to higher numbers of flowering adults (P < 0.009), demonstrating that inflorescence-feeding insects significantly reduced lifetime fitness. Neither individual compensation for seed loss, nor density-dependent com- pensation for increased plant population densities, was observed when insects were ex- cluded. Thus, we conclude that the inflorescence-feeding insect herbivores limited seed production, seedling recruitment, plant density, and maternal fitness of this plant under natural conditions. This outcome challenges current theoretical models of the effect of insects on plant population dynamics. We predict that our result will be general for short- lived perennial plants with life histories in which persistence is tightly linked to regeneration from current seed, such as for fugitive perennials with transient seed banks.

                  <jats:p>With the increase of land-use change, habitat fragmentation has become a major factor affecting plant diversity. Generally, when the adult density is high, the survival rate of conspecific saplings may decline and provide more resources and space for other species to maintain a high local species diversity. Therefore, the spatial relationship of conspecific saplings and adults (SRCSA) can regulate plant diversity. However, very few studies have assessed SRCSA within fragmented forests, and we still largely unknown the relationship between SRCSA and species diversity in fragmented landscapes.</jats:p>

                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>We calculated the mean strength of SRCSA using the spatial distribution data of saplings and adults with a log-transformed hierarchical offset-power model on 27 islands in a land-bridge island system. The higher strength of SRCSA reflects a more negative relationship between the density of conspecific saplings and adults on an island (i.e. the looser pattern of SRCSA). We tested the relationships among island attributes (i.e. island area, the distance to the mainland—MD, and the distance to the nearest island—ND), SRCSA and species diversity.</jats:p>

                  <jats:p>The strength of SRCSA increased with ND. Meanwhile, the species diversity significantly increased with the strength of SRCSA, and island area and the strength of SRCSA independently explained 26% and 6% of variation of species diversity, respectively, and their interactions explained 8%. Shade-intolerant and low-abundant species showed looser patterns of SRCSA. Our study suggests that SRCSA may have the effect of excluding species with a relatively low abundance in isolated island forests, which illustrates the importance of biotic interactions in maintaining plant diversity in fragmented forests. Our results also emphasize that we should consider forest connectivity when testing the conspecific negative density dependence.</jats:p>

TI  - Avian fruit consumption and seed dispersal in a temperate Australian woodland
PY  - 2002
AB  - Abstract The effectiveness of avian fruit consumers as seed dispersers of fleshy-fruited plants was studied in a temperate woodland community. As a consequence of the short and overlapping fruiting phenologies of fleshy-fruited plant species in temperate regions of Australia, there are very few avian species that are true specialist frugivores. The relative importance of bird species as fruit consumers was investigated, and how their foraging activities, movements and gut treatment of seeds affected dispersal of viable seeds away from the parent plant was examined. Fruit consumption and consumer seed dispersal capacity were assessed in this study through faecal analyses and by testing the viability of seeds that had passed through the gut of avian consumers. Behavioural observations enabled us to determine the consumption rates of, and quantities of fruit consumed by, various bird species and the amount of time spent feeding. Silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) were the dominant fruit consumers in the community, although 19 bird species were either observed consuming fruit or provided faecal samples that contained fruit. Silvereyes had a high local abundance at the site and more than 90% of silvereyes’faecal samples contained the seeds of fruiting plants (n = 409). Large numbers of fruit were consumed per visit by silvereyes, particularly for Rhagodia parabolica (fragrant saltbush). Silvereyes consumed an average of four R. parabolica fruit per 5 s and up to a maximum 40 fruit per visit. Viability was high for seeds recovered from silvereyes’faeces (R. parabolica, 94.4% viable; Hymenanthera dentata, 100% viable). However, the number of seeds per faecal sample was high for R. parabolica, which may result in density-dependent seed mortality. Gut passage rate for silvereyes fed R. parabolica fruit in captivity was 31.5 ± 1.9 min. Silvereyes remained at fruiting plants for very short periods (average 50-60 s) and in most cases moved away from the parent plant, primarily toward canopy trees. Given the short visit duration of silvereyes, individuals would have left the parent plant well before seeds passed through the gut. Rhagodia parabolica fruit was consumed by a large number of bird species in the community, including species often thought of as exclusively insectivorous or nectarivorous. These species are likely to disperse viable R. parabolica seeds into microhabitats different from those visited by silvereyes.

TI  - HERBIVORY, PLANT REGENERATION, AND SPECIES COEXISTENCE
PY  - 1996
AB  - The mechanisms by which plants species coexist in botanically diverse communities has been the focus of intense theoretical and empirical interest (Harper 1977; Grubb et al. 1982; Tilman & Pacala 1993). However, although considerable empirical data exist on the structure of plant communities, there is still no consensus regarding the mechanisms underlying species diversity (Crawley 1986; Tilman & Pacala 1993). Since the number of plant species found to coexist within most habitats is often greater than the number of limiting resources, studies have focused on mechanisms limiting or preventing competitive exclusion. Although none of the principal models developed to explain species coexistence at local scales are mutually exclusive, they fall into two broad groups (Crawley 1986; Zobel 1992; Tilman & Pacala 1993): those where the principal mechanism mediates exploitative competition between established plants for resources (light, nutrients, etc.), e.g. resource partitioning, spatial and temporal heterogeneity in resource supply and neighbourhood effects; and those that focus on limiting pre-emptive competition for microsites, e.g. regeneration niches, phenological heterogeneity, patch dynamics and lottery models (Table 1). Herbivory has often been treated in these models of plant community structure as a type of disturbance (Grime 1979; Tilman 1982). However, the impact of selective herbivores on resource partitioning (by grazing plant tissues) or regeneration (by reducing numbers of propagules via preor postdispersal predation) may differ considerably from most forms of disturbance. The extensive literature describing the impact herbivores may have on the demography of the plant species they consume (Crawley 1988; Huntly 1991) has led to the suggestion that herbivory may be more important than competition in structuring terrestrial plant communities (Sih et al. 1985). Nevertheless, comparatively few studies provide tractable hypotheses regarding the role of herbivores in vegetational diversity (Huntly 1991). This paper addresses the role

TI  - Habitat heterogeneity and biotic interactions mediate climate influences on seedling survival in a temperate forest
PY  - 2023
AB  - Seedling stage has long been recognized as the bottleneck of forest regeneration, and the biotic and abiotic processes that dominate at seedling stage largely affect the dynamics of forest. Seedlings might be particularly vulnerable to climate stress, so elucidating the role of interannual climate variation in fostering community dynamics is crucial to understanding the response of forest to climate change. Using seedling survival data of 69 woody species collected for five consecutive years from a 25-ha permanent plot in a temperate deciduous forest, we identified the effects of biotic interactions and habitat factors on seedling survival, and examined how those effects changed over time. We found that interannual climate variations, followed by biotic interactions and habitat conditions, were the most significant predictors of seedling survival. Understory light showed a positive impact on seedling mortality, and seedling survival responded differently to soil and air temperature. Effects of conspecific neighbor density were significantly strengthened with the increase of maximum air temperature and vapor pressure deficits in the growing season, but were weakened by increased maximum soil temperature and precipitation in the non-growing season. Surprisingly, seedling survival was strongly correlated with interannual climate variability at all life stages, and the strength of the correlation increased with seedling age. In addition, the importance of biotic and abiotic factors on seedling survival differed significantly among species-trait groups. Thus, the neighborhood-mediated effects on mortality might be significantly contributing or even inverting the direct effects of varying abiotic conditions on seedling survival, and density-dependent effects could not be the only important factor influencing seedling survival at an early stage.

TI  - Community composition and diversity of Neotropical root-associated fungi in common and rare trees
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Interactions between plants and root‐associated fungi can affect the assembly, diversity, and relative abundances of tropical plant species. Host–symbiont compatibility and some degree of host specificity are prerequisites for these processes to occur, and these prerequisites may vary with host abundance. However, direct assessments of whether specificity of root‐associated fungi varies with host abundance are lacking. Here, in a diverse tropical forest in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, we couple DNA metabarcoding with a sampling design that controls for host phylogeny, host age, and habitat variation, to characterize fungal communities associated with the roots of three confamilial pairs of host species that exhibit contrasting (high and low) relative abundances. We uncovered a functionally and phylogenetically diverse fungal community composed of 1,038 OTUs (operational taxonomic units with 97% genetic similarity), only 14 of which exhibited host specificity. Host species was a significant predictor of fungal community composition only for the subset of OTUs composed of putatively pathogenic fungi. We found no significant difference in the number of specialists associating with common versus rare trees, but we found that host abundance was negatively correlated with the diversity of root fungal communities. This latter result was significant for symbiotrophs (mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and, to a lesser extent, for pathotrophs (mostly plant pathogens). Thus, root fungal communities differ between common and rare trees, which may impact the strength of conspecific negative density dependence. Further studies from other tropical sites and host lineages are warranted, given the role of root‐associated fungi in biodiversity maintenance.</jats:p>

TI  - Climate warming may weaken stabilizing mechanisms in old forests
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Plant competition may intensify with climate warming, but whether this will occur equally for conspecific and heterospecific competition remains unknown. Competitive shifts have the potential to instigate community change because the relative strengths of conspecific and heterospecific negative density dependence mediate the stabilizing mechanisms underpinning species coexistence. We examined a mature temperate forest to assess both direct and indirect climate effects at multiple scales: individual species, interspecies relationships, and community stability mechanisms. Our coupled approach (1) quantified tree mortality risk dependence on the interactive effects of competition, climatic water deficit, snowpack, and soil moisture for 28,913 trees over 8 years (3149 mortalities), then (2) used a climate‐projection ensemble to forecast changes in conspecific and heterospecific competition from 2020 to 2100. We predict that projected climate warming will destabilize the foundational forest community by increasing the strength of heterospecific competition at a greater rate and to a greater degree than conspecific competition for four of five abundant tree species, particularly on dry microsites. Modeling showed that these findings were most pronounced after the year 2038, at which point snowpacks were projected to be too small to ameliorate the effects of drought on competitive interactions. Our finding that heterospecific competition is more sensitive than conspecific competition to climate warming may indicate the impending loss of ecosystem functioning. We join the growing body of work showing a predominance of indirect drought effects, yet coupled climate models still fail to consider how changing community dynamics may impact forest cover and, in turn, disrupt forest–climate carbon feedbacks. Ecosystems sharing characteristics with our example forest—those with low species richness and therefore a limited biodiversity insurance effect—may be similarly vulnerable to climate‐mediated destabilization. In such communities, increased heterospecific competition among even a small number of species can more easily destabilize communities without recourse from redundant species. This study of an overlooked but vital mechanism of community change can be adapted by research in a range of ecosystems to improve the understanding of climate change consequences.</jats:p>

TI  - Differences in Density Dependence among Tree Mycorrhizal Types Affect Tree Species Diversity and Relative Growth Rates.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) may vary by tree mycorrhizal type. However, whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)-associated tree species suffer from stronger CNDD than ectomycorrhizal (EcM) and ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM)-associated tree species at different tree life stages, and whether EcM tree species can promote AM and ErM saplings and adults growth, remain to be studied. Based on the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest data in eastern China, the generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the effects of the conspecific density and heterospecific density grouped by symbiont mycorrhizal type on different tree life stages of different tree mycorrhizal types. The results showed that compared to other tree mycorrhizal types at the same growth stage, EcM saplings and AM adults experienced stronger CNDD. Heterospecific EcM density had a stronger positive effect on AM and ErM individuals. Species diversity and average relative growth rate (RGR) first increased and then decreased with increasing basal area (BA) ratios of EcM to AM tree species. These results suggested that the stronger CNDD of EcM saplings and AM adults favored local species diversity over other tree mycorrhizal types. The EcM tree species better facilitated the growth of AM and ErM tree species in the neighborhood, increasing the forest carbon sink rate. Interestingly, species diversity and average RGR decreased when EcM or AM tree species predominated. Therefore, our study highlights that manipulating the BA ratio of EcM to AM tree species will play a nonnegligible role in maintaining biodiversity and increasing forest carbon sink rates.

TI  - On the causes of gradients in tropical tree diversity
PY  - 1999
AB  - 1 The number of woody species in tropical forests tends to increase with precipitation, forest stature, soil fertility, rate of canopy turnover and time since catastrophic disturbance, and decrease with seasonality, latitude, altitude, and diameter at breast height (d.b.h.).



2 A model is presented to account for these trends. Novel hypotheses include how increased rainfall and substrate fertility, and decreased seasonality, might (i) increase attacks by natural enemies, and thus the overall level of density-dependent plant mortality; (ii) increase shade tolerance, canopy turnover, and stem density of the species-rich understorey; and (iii) increase reliance on relatively sedentary forest-interior birds for seed dispersal, fostering high rates of speciation in understorey genera.



3 High rainfall and low seasonality in the tropics favour two key groups of natural plant enemies – insects and fungi – that are directly responsible for promoting high rates of density-dependent plant mortality. Lower rainfall, greater seasonality, soil infertility, or unfavourable rooting conditions favour greater allocation to anti-herbivore defences, and thus lead to lower rates of such mortality and thence to lower tree diversity. The increased number of individuals on rainier sites is a minor contributor to increased tree diversity, accounting for only about 17% of the 8.3-fold increase with rainfall in the lowland Neotropics.



4 Predictions of the model are consistent with many ecological patterns of variation in tropical tree diversity within regions, and may help explain the decrease in tree diversity with elevation and the accompanying decrease in horizontal patchiness (within-habitat β diversity).



5 Random drift over evolutionary time in the relative effectiveness of density-dependent control of individual tree species by specialized natural enemies may better account for the observed distribution of tropical tree abundance than a random walk of species abundance through ecological time.

TI  - Canopy cover mediates interactions between a specialist caterpillar and seedlings of a neotropical tree
PY  - 2007
AB  - 1 Light availability may be crucial for understanding dynamics of plant–herbivore interactions in temperate and tropical forest communities. This is because local light availability can influence both tree seedling tolerance and susceptibility to herbivory – yet how they mediate levels of insect herbivory that vary with the density of host population is virtually unknown. Here we tested predictions of three key, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses of plant–herbivore interactions: the Limiting Resource Model (LRM), the Plant Vigour Hypothesis (PVH), and the Janzen-Connell Mechanism (JCM).
2 In an Amazonian forest, we planted Swietenia macrophylla seedlings (c. 5 months old) into natural canopy gaps and the shaded understorey and simulated the damage patterns of the specialist herbivore moth, Steniscadia poliophaea, by clipping seedling leaves. Over the next 8 months, we monitored seedling performance in terms of growth and survivorship and also quantified herbivory to new young leaves on a seasonal basis.
3 In support of the LRM, severe leaf damage (≥ 50%) was lethal for Swietenia macrophylla seedlings in the understorey, but in gaps only reduced seedling growth. In support of the PVH, gap seedlings suffered greater post-simulated herbivory (up to 100% defoliation) by S. poliophaea caterpillars than their understorey counterparts.
4 Adding a novel dimension to the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, we found that early wet season herbivory of seedlings in gaps increased with conspecific adult density within a 125-m radius; whereas in the understorey only those seedlings within 50 m of a Swietenia tree were attacked by caterpillars.
5 Synthesis. These results suggest lepidopterans that need young leaves for food may forage more widely in forests to find seedlings in light-rich canopy gaps. Moths may achieve this successfully by being first attracted to gaps, and then searching within them for suitable hosts. A conceptual model, integrating conspecific adult tree density with light-driven changes in seedling tolerance/vigour and their susceptibility to herbivory and mortality, is presented. Spatial variation in the light available to tree seedlings often affects their tolerance and vigour, which may have important consequences for leaf-chewing insects and the scale of density-dependent herbivory in forests.

TI  - Differential impacts of adult trees on offspring and non-offspring recruits in a subtropical forest.
PY  - 2022
AB  - An important mechanism promoting species coexistence is conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), which inhibits conspecific neighbors by accumulating host-specific enemies near adult trees. Natural enemies may be genotype-specific and regulate offspring dynamics more strongly than non-offspring, which is often neglected due to the difficulty in ascertaining genetic relatedness. Here, we investigated whether offspring and non-offspring of a dominant species, Castanopsis eyrei, suffered from different strength of CNDD based on parentage assignment in a subtropical forest. We found decreased recruitment efficiency (proxy of survival probability) of offspring compared with non-offspring near adult trees during the seedling-sapling transition, suggesting genotype-dependent interactions drive tree demographic dynamics. Furthermore, the genetic similarity between individuals of same cohort decreased in late life history stages, indicating genetic-relatedness-dependent tree mortality throughout ontogeny. Our results demonstrate that within-species genetic relatedness significantly affects the strength of CNDD, implying genotype-specific natural enemies may contribute to population dynamics in natural forests.

TI  - Effects of density dependence in a temperate forest in northeastern China
PY  - 2016
AB  - Negative density dependence may cause reduced clustering among individuals of the same species, and evidence is accumulating that conspecific density-dependent self-thinning is an important mechanism regulating the spatial structure of plant populations. This study evaluates that specific density dependence in three very large observational studies representing three successional stages in a temperate forest in northeastern China. The methods include standard spatial point pattern analysis and a heterogeneous Poisson process as the null model to eliminate the effects of habitat heterogeneity. The results show that most of the species exhibit conspecific density-dependent self-thinning. In the early successional stage 11 of the 16 species, in the intermediate successional stage 18 of the 21 species and in the old growth stage all 21 species exhibited density dependence after removing the effects of habitat heterogeneity. The prevalence of density dependence thus varies among the three successional stages and exhibits an increase with increasing successional stage. The proportion of species showing density dependence varied depending on whether habitat heterogeneity was removed or not. Furthermore, the strength of density dependence is closely related with species abundance. Abundant species with high conspecific aggregation tend to exhibit greater density dependence than rare species.

TI  - Shade tolerance and mycorrhizal type may influence sapling susceptibility to conspecific negative density dependence
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The maintenance of tree diversity has been explained by multiple mechanisms. One of the most thoroughly studied is conspecific negative density dependence, in which specialist plant enemies reduce survivorship of seeds, seedlings or saplings located near adult conspecifics. Although there is much support that conspecific negative density dependence occurs in temperate forests, only a subset of the species investigated thus far exhibit this recruitment pattern. It remains unclear what drives differential susceptibility to conspecifics among tree species. Previous investigators have considered shade tolerance and mycorrhizal type (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal association) as two traits that might explain differential susceptibility to conspecific negative density dependence.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we test whether these two plant traits predict susceptibility of tree saplings to conspecific negative density dependence in a temperate hardwood forest using three responses: spatial point patterns of saplings, sapling growth and sapling survival.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Spatial patterns of saplings indicate that shade tolerant species are less sensitive to conspecifics than shade intolerant species, but show no differences based on mycorrhizal type. Conversely, shade tolerant saplings exhibit reduced growth, but not survival, when located in areas with high conspecific density. We interpret this finding in light of the conservative functional strategies of shade tolerant species, which typically have low leaf nitrogen levels and slower growth to divert resources to tissue defence against enemies. We found an effect of mycorrhizal type interacting with adult conspecific density, where arbuscular mycorrhizal species show a greater reduction in growth than ectomycorrhizal species in areas dense with conspecifics.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. We conclude that the shade tolerance level and the mycorrhizal type of temperate forest saplings may influence how their growth and survival respond to the adult conspecific trees in their neighbourhoods.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

                  <jats:title>Important Findings</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>SEM showed that tree functional traits, including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf N content (LNC), maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax) and conspecific adult negative density dependence (CNDDadult), together explained 20% of the total variation in tree abundance. Specifically, SLA affected tree abundance both directly and indirectly via CNDDadult, with a totally negative influence on abundance. LDMC and LNC had only indirect effects mediated by CNDDadult on tree abundance. ETRmax and LA had directly negative effects on abundance, but their direct connections with CNDDadult were not observed. In addition, CNDDadult was negatively correlated with species abundance, indicating that abundant species are under stronger NDD. Among these investigated traits, SLA contributed the most to the variation in CNDDadult and abundance. We argued that our findings of trait–CNDDadult–abundance relationships can improve our understanding of the determinants of species commonness and rarity in forests.</jats:p>

TI  - Negative Density Restricts the Coexistence and Spatial Distribution of Dominant Species in Subtropical Evergreen Broad-Leaved Forests in China
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Negative densification affects the spatial distribution of species in secondary evergreen broad-leaved forests and is a key mechanism governing species coexistence. We investigated the effects of habitat heterogeneity and density on the spatial distribution of populations of dominant woody species in a secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest in Wuchaoshan using spatial univariate point pattern analyses. This 6 ha forest dynamic monitoring sample area in Hangzhou, China is a typical secondary subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. We found (1) a strong effect of habitat heterogeneity that led to the spatial aggregation of dominant species in the plot. Habitat heterogeneity had a strong impact on mature individuals at different life history stages and of different species on a large scale. (2) Negative density dependence (NDD) generally affected spatial distributions of most dominant species and decreased in magnitude with age class. Therefore, different species of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in China have formed unique spatial structures due to their habitat preferences but are generally subjected to density-dependent effects.</jats:p>

TI  - Travelling waves due to negative plant-soil feedbacks in a model including tree life-stages.
PY  - 2023
AB  - The emergence and maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests is commonly attributed to the Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis, which states that growth of seedlings is suppressed in the proximity of conspecific adult trees. As a result, a JC distribution due to a density-dependent negative feedback emerges in the form of a (transient) pattern where conspecific seedling density is highest at intermediate distances away from parent trees. Several studies suggest that the required density-dependent feedbacks behind this pattern could result from interactions between trees and soil-borne pathogens. However, negative plant-soil feedback may involve additional mechanisms, including the accumulation of autotoxic compounds generated through tree litter decomposition. An essential task therefore consists in constructing mathematical models incorporating both effects showing the ability to support the emergence of JC distributions. In this work, we develop and analyse a novel reaction-diffusion-ODE model, describing the interactions within tropical tree species across different life stages (seeds, seedlings, and adults) as driven by negative plant-soil feedback. In particular, we show that under strong negative plant-soil feedback travelling wave solutions exist, creating transient distributions of adult trees and seedlings that are in agreement with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Moreover, we show that these travelling wave solutions are pulled fronts and a robust feature as they occur over a broad parameter range. Finally, we calculate their linear spreading speed and show its (in)dependence on relevant nondimensional parameters.

TI  - Ant-mediated seed dispersal does not facilitate niche expansion
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary

1. Whereas classic niche theory is based on the contraction of the niche via negative interactions, facilitative niche theory suggests that mutualisms can expand the niche via positive interactions. Specifically, animal-mediated seed dispersal can expand the utilization of physical space by plants and allow greater access to resources and other environmental requirements. Ant-mediated dispersal of plant propagules (myrmecochory) is a common mutualism throughout the world, particularly in the deciduous forests of the eastern United States where this research is conducted.



2. We examine two facets of niche expansion via ant-mediated seed dispersal: (1) increased utilization of resources along resource gradients and (2) escape from unfavourable density-dependent conditions.



3. We test these assumptions by introducing Hexastylis arifolia seeds in cafeteria-style bait stations along abiotic gradients (moisture, temperature, light) for removal by key seed dispersers from the ant genus Aphaenogaster. We also examine plant aggregation along the same gradients.



4. Ant-mediated dispersal services decrease significantly with increasing soil moisture and ultimately fail at levels that are demonstratively within the plant’s niche optima; further, the decline in dispersal services is correlated with increasing plant aggregation, suggesting that enemy escape also falters at relatively high levels of soil moisture.



5. Synthesis. Facilitated propagule dispersal fails to expand the Hexastylis arifolia niche in either enhanced resource utilization or decreased density dependence as the niche requirements for the ant disperser are nested within those for the plant. The strength of this interaction varies across space and time, and in doing so may undermine attempts to predict future distributions. Further, given that myrmecochores are typically poor dispersers, the incomplete niche overlap between the plant and its facilitator makes this plant guild particularly susceptible to climatic change if each participant responds individually to shifting environmental conditions.

TI  - Recruitment and survival of Argyrodendron actinophyllum seedlings in an Australian rainforest
PY  - 1999
AB  - The capacity of seedlings to survive for extended periods beneath intact forest increases the likelihood of regeneration of many species of canopy trees in rainforests. I studied the demographics of Argyrodendron actinophyllum (F.M.Bail.) H.L.Edlin seedlings in a subtropical rainforest in northern New South Wales. A mast seeding of A. actinophyllum was observed and subsequent survival of seedlings monitored over a four year period. Densities of seedlings that emerged correlated with seedfall, while seedfall depended on the size and distance to the surrounding trees. Mortality of seedlings showed density-dependence at higher seedling densities (above about 100 seedlings m -2) , apparently in response to browsing pressure that varied with the density of seedlings. Seedlings that were protected from vertebrates by exclosure cages had lower mortality rates than unprotected seedlings and showed no density response. Glasshouse experiments showed seedling growth was reduced by defoliation, light intensity and initial seed weight, and that seedlings could not persist at light intensities below about 1% ambient, which occur in darker patches on the forest floor. Possible mechanisms whereby the observed spatial and temporal patterns of seedling recruitment could reduce the likelihood of the species becoming more common relative to other tree species in the forest are discussed.

TI  - Structural breakdown of specialized plant-herbivore interaction networks in tropical forest edges
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Plant-herbivore relationships are essential for ecosystem functioning, typically forming an ecological network with a compartmentalized (i.e. modular) structure characterized by highly specialized interactions. Human disturbances can favor habitat generalist species and thus cause the collapse of this modular structure, but its effects are rarely assessed using a network-based approach. We investigate how edge proximity alters plant-insect herbivore networks by comparing forest edge and interior in a large remnant (3.500 ha) of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Given the typical dominance of pioneer plants and generalist herbivores in edge-affected habitats, we test the hypothesis that the specialized structure of plant-herbivore networks collapse in forest edges, resulting in lower modularity and herbivore specialization. Despite no differences in the number of species and interactions, the network structure presented marked differences between forest edges and interior. Herbivore specialization, modularity and number of modules were significantly higher in forest interior than edge-affected habitats. When compared to a random null model, two (22.2%) and eight (88.8%) networks were significantly modular in forest edge and interior, respectively. The loss of specificity and modularity in plant-herbivore networks in forest edges may be related to the loss of important functions, such as density-dependent control of superior plant competitors, which is ultimately responsible for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Our results support previous warnings that focusing on traditional community measures only (e.g. species diversity) may overlook important modifications in species interactions and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Latitudinal patterns in stabilizing density dependence of forest communities.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Numerous studies have shown reduced performance in plants that are surrounded by neighbours of the same species<sup>1,2</sup>, a phenomenon known as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD)<sup>3</sup>. A long-held ecological hypothesis posits that CNDD is more pronounced in tropical than in temperate forests<sup>4,5</sup>, which increases community stabilization, species coexistence and the diversity of local tree species<sup>6,7</sup>. Previous analyses supporting such a latitudinal gradient in CNDD<sup>8,9</sup> have suffered from methodological limitations related to the use of static data<sup>10-12</sup>. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of latitudinal CNDD patterns using dynamic mortality data to estimate species-site-specific CNDD across 23 sites. Averaged across species, we found that stabilizing CNDD was present at all except one site, but that average stabilizing CNDD was not stronger toward the tropics. However, in tropical tree communities, rare and intermediate abundant species experienced stronger stabilizing CNDD than did common species. This pattern was absent in temperate forests, which suggests that CNDD influences species abundances more strongly in tropical forests than it does in temperate ones<sup>13</sup>. We also found that interspecific variation in CNDD, which might attenuate its stabilizing effect on species diversity<sup>14,15</sup>, was high but not significantly different across latitudes. Although the consequences of these patterns for latitudinal diversity gradients are difficult to evaluate, we speculate that a more effective regulation of population abundances could translate into greater stabilization of tropical tree communities and thus contribute to the high local diversity of tropical forests.

TI  - Effects of dispersal, shrubs, and density-dependent mortality on seed and seedling distributions in temperate forests
PY  - 2003
AB  - Processes limiting recruitment of trees may have large impacts on forest dynamics. In this paper, we deter- mined the effects of dispersal, shrubs (Rhododendron maximum), and density-dependent mortality on seed and seedling distributions of Southern Appalachian trees. We quantified the spatial distribution of seed rain, seed bank densities, first-year seedlings, and older than first-year seedlings in five vegetation plots. We fit models to these data assuming effects of limited dispersal, R. maximum (an understory shrub), and (or) density-dependent mortality (as well as a null model with none of these effects) and used best-fitting models to indicate which processes affected a particular species. We found that all factors examined limit species distributions, and thus, affect seedling dynamics. Seedling densities are higher near parent trees long after dispersal occurs. This pattern is less frequently observed for animal-dispersed species than for wind-dispersed species, presumably due to secondary dispersal of seeds by animals. Seedling densities of five species are decreased beneath R. maximum. Shade tolerance does not explain which species are affected, sug- gesting that factors other than low light are responsible for increased seedling mortality under this shrub. Our results suggest that density-dependent mortality affects four species, decreasing seedling densities close to parent trees. Dis- persal, density-dependent mortality, and R. maximum all act in ways that may promote or limit diversity, illustrating that multiple factors are likely to control species diversity.

TI  - Intraspecific Variation in Seed Dispersion of Lepidium campestre (Barassicaceae)
PY  - 1996
AB  - Intraspecific variation in seed dispersion provides the initial context for frequency-dependent and density-dependent processes affecting seed/seedling survival. We examined intraspecific variation in seed dispersion in a ballistically dispersed herbaceous annual, Lepidium campestre, in both the presence/absence of vegetation to determine the magnitude of variation in seed dispersion among parents, the relationship of this variation to parental architecture, and the effect of the presence of vegetation both on the variation and on its relationship to parental architecture. We quantified seed dispersion by placing concentric rings of traps around individual parents out to a distance of 2 m in the presence/absence of vegetation in an old-field plant community. In the absence of vegetation, parents differed in the distance and direction that their seeds traveled. Parental height and infructescence length explained a significant proportion of the variation in mean and standard deviation of seed dispersal distance, as well as skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of seed number as a function of distance. The mean direction that seeds traveled was correlated with all architectural traits. When plants dispersed their seeds in sites with dense vegetation, mean dispersal distance and standard deviation in distance decreased, and dispersal distributions were more right-skewed and leptokurtic. The presence/absence of vegetation explained some of the variation among parents in the moments of the distance distribution, but architectural traits also contributed to these descriptive models. Directional components of dispersal were not affected by vegetation. Correspondence analysis, a multivariate technique that examined distance and direction simultaneously, revealed that architectural attributes related to variation in dispersion were different from analyses of distance alone. These results suggest that architectural attributes of the parent contribute not only to the distance that seeds travel, but also to other axes of variation, i.e., skewness and kurtosis of the distance distribution or multivariate axes of seed dispersion. Surrounding vegetation alters seed dispersion, but parental attributes can still explain some of the residual variation. This variation in seed dispersion among parents creates the opportunity for selection on parental dispersal traits.

TI  - Habitat Filtering Covers the Strength of Density Dependence and Functional Density Dependence on Seedling Survival in Cangshan Mountain, Southwest China
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is an important mechanism for species coexistence and community dynamics. Phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD) and functional negative density dependence (FNDD) are extensions of CNDD, and many studies have shown that they have become powerful and reliable methods for exploring the mechanisms of species coexistence. However, most studies have focused on only one or two of these mechanisms and have not considered whether and how habitat variables affect the detection of these density dependences. To investigate the relative importance of these mechanisms, we set up three 0.09 ha dynamic plots at Cangshan Mountain in southwest China, and used generalized linear mixed models to analyze how the survival of 546 woody plant seedlings was affected by neighborhood density and habitat variables. Our results showed that heterospecific seedling density dependence and functional trait density dependence played key roles in seedling survival. Habitat factors, phylogenetic densities, and adult neighbors had no significant effect on seedling survival in the three plots. However, habitat filtering covered the detection of density dependence and functional trait density dependence. Our study demonstrates that failure to control for habitat variables may obscure the importance of density dependence and functional trait density dependence on seedling survival.</jats:p>

TI  - Browsing and Microhabitat Effects on Riparian Forest Woody Seedling Demography
PY  - 2002
AB  - Forest seedling demography and seedling diversity are commonly impacted by spatially variable microhabitat effects on germination and establishment. For many forests of the eastern United States, herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) also can be intense and impose severe restrictions on seedling demography. The concurrent effects of these “bottom-up” and “top-down” factors were examined in a riparian forest on the Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland, USA. Random permanent-plot surveys found that two microhabitat factors, soil moisture and leaf litter, were correlated with seedling spatial distributions. These correlations suggest that microhabitat variability promotes seedling diversity. Microhabitat effects due to codominant American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) canopies had limited impacts on seedling demography but were consistent with the random surveys. In contrast, experimental results show that browsing had distinct demographic effects on seedling populations and strong collective impacts at the community level. Although not completely overriding the importance of microhabitat effects, browsing may be viewed as a consistent and spatially ubiquitous top-down constraint on seedling populations. Four distinctive relationships between seedling density and species-specific browsing intensity were apparent: density-independence, density-dependence, avoidance, and opportunism. These species-specific relationships are related to browsing preference, palatability, and life-history traits of the tree species. In contrast, at the community level browsing on woody species is strictly density dependent and emerges as a consequence of cumulative species-specific patterns. Because of complementary species-specific browsing patterns and variation among cohorts of each species, browsing impacts at the community level were more clearly defined. These impacts included a 39% increase in annual seedling mortality rate, a 42% reduction in seedling recruitment, a 28% reduction in basal-diameter increment, and a 35% reduction in the rate of population increase. White-tailed deer browsing in this forest has the potential to decrease seedling diversity by impacting species differentially, offsetting the diversifying impact of microhabitat variation, and suppressing total seedling density. Nonetheless, browsing may not alter the trajectory of forest succession from that expected based on life-history characteristics of the two dominant species because: (1) American beech is shade tolerant and only slightly impacted by browsing, (2) codominant yellow-poplar is shade intolerant and a preferred browse species, and (3) the primary understory species (spicebush [Lindera benzoin] and ironwood [Carpinus caroliniana]), although heavily browsed, are not suppressed by browsing. Microhabitat, browsing, and tree species life-history traits should be considered collectively in considering the current status and predicted future of this forest.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Theoretical models suggest that species abundance plays a crucial role in mutualism; high densities can lead to overexploitation. Additionally, mutualistic benefits are expected to increase under abiotic stress.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We investigated the interplay between density dependence and abiotic factors in conditional mutualism, focussing on the interactions between yellow‐necked mice (<jats:italic>Apodemus flavicollis</jats:italic>) and common oaks (<jats:italic>Quercus robur</jats:italic>) across 3 years. We controlled for seed abundance, while mouse densities varied. Our approach included monitoring mouse abundance, measuring seed removal, determining the fate of harvested seeds and conducting seedling emergence trials to assess the advantages of seeds caching.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that mouse abundance exerted a strong influence on all studied aspects of seed dispersal. Higher densities led to increased seed removal and greater dispersal distances. However, they also decreased the probability of seed caching and increased seed consumption, degrading dispersal quality and shifting the interaction towards antagonism. Furthermore, the reliance of seedling recruitment on burial varied over time, likely becoming more critical during dry conditions. This indicates that plants face the worst conditions when high abundance of mice coincides with abiotic stress.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>: Our results supports the notion that increased rodent abundance reduces plant recruitment, revealing the conflicting interests of the interacting species. However, the dynamics of rodent–oak interactions are shaped not only by the density‐dependent foraging decisions of rodents, but also by the benefits of seed burial under stress. These findings illustrate how the interplay between population density and abiotic factors jointly dictate the costs and benefits of mutualistic interactions.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Mycorrhizal feedbacks influence global forest structure and diversity.
PY  - 2023
AB  - One mechanism proposed to explain high species diversity in tropical systems is strong negative conspecific density dependence (CDD), which reduces recruitment of juveniles in proximity to conspecific adult plants. Although evidence shows that plant-specific soil pathogens can drive negative CDD, trees also form key mutualisms with mycorrhizal fungi, which may counteract these effects. Across 43 large-scale forest plots worldwide, we tested whether ectomycorrhizal tree species exhibit weaker negative CDD than arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species. We further tested for conmycorrhizal density dependence (CMDD) to test for benefit from shared mutualists. We found that the strength of CDD varies systematically with mycorrhizal type, with ectomycorrhizal tree species exhibiting higher sapling densities with increasing adult densities than arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species. Moreover, we found evidence of positive CMDD for tree species of both mycorrhizal types. Collectively, these findings indicate that mycorrhizal interactions likely play a foundational role in global forest diversity patterns and structure.

TI  - Dispersal success of a specialized tropical tree depends on complex interactions among diverse mammalian frugivores
PY  - 2022
AB  - The study of seed dispersal in tropical forest communities is complicated by the high diversity of frugivores and the complex interactions among species and their environments. Determining which species are effective dispersers and which are opportunists with neutral or even negative effects on fruiting plants is a major problem which requires detailed studies focused on particular plant species. In this study we focused on seed dispersal of the wild rambutan (Nephelium melliferum) which supplies energy-rich fruits to primates and other mammals in a seasonal evergreen forest in central Thailand. We hypothesized that gibbons (Hylobates lar) were the most important dispersers and were capable of carrying and defecating seeds away from the tree crown where seeds or seedlings could escape increased distance or density-dependent mortality. We determined the seed dispersal effectiveness of all major arboreal consumers of Nephelium fruit (gibbons, pig-tail monkeys, squirrels) by using data on fruit production and consumption from fruit/seed traps under the canopies of eight sample trees, observations on animals feeding in fruiting trees, and seed deposition data at varying distances from tree crowns. We assessed the survival of seeds and seedlings in relation to distance from the crown by experiments and transect counts. Camera traps were used to detect consumption of seeds on the ground by terrestrial consumers. About half of the ripe fruit crop was harvested by squirrels which gnawed off the outer husk, ate the pulp and dropped intact seeds to the ground. Monkeys chewed and sucked off the pulp and dropped most seeds to the ground not far from the tree. Seeds and intact fruits dropped by squirrels and monkeys supported a large variety of terrestrial mammals most of which were seed predators. Gibbons, which swallow the seed with pulp attached, consumed only 16 % of the fruit crop but were the most effective and reliable seed dispersers overall, and appear to be the most specialized seed dispersal mutualist. Distance-dependent mortality was found in first-year seedlings, as well as evidence that further mortality must space out older saplings prior to recruitment into the tree population, which validates the importance of dispersal by gibbons. However, the great majority of fruits of Nephelium melliferum were consumed by mammalian opportunists and seed predators which interacted with one another in ways which depend on composition of the local community.

TI  - Unravelling conflicting density- and distance-dependent effects on plant reproduction using a spatially explicit approach
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary

Density- and distance-dependent (DDD) mechanisms are important determinants of plant reproductive success (PRS). Different components of sequential PRS can operate either in the same or in different directions and thus reinforce or neutralize each other, and they may also operate at different spatial scales. Thus, spatially explicit approaches are needed to detect such complex DDD effects across multiple PRS components and spatial scales.
To reveal DDD effects of different components of early PRS of the Iberian pear (Pyrus bourgaeana) sampled over three consecutive years, we used marked point pattern analysis. Our special interest is to identify conflicting processes that regulate populations at different spatial scales, for example whether DDD on fruit initiation and on fruit development acted in opposite directions. To evaluate the significance of observed mark correlation functions based on empirical data (e.g. fruiting success), we compared them to expectations given by spatially explicit null models.
Diverse DDD processes affected several aspects of PRS in a variable extent over the three seasons. First, fruit initiation was higher for individuals with more neighbours at small distances (i.e. up to 40 m). However, P. bourgaeana fruit development decreased with increasing number of nearby neighbours, but these effects cancelled for overall fruit set that did not show DDD effects. Secondly, the absolute number of fruits produced (crop sizes) by trees showed positive density dependence in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013. Finally, the total number of seeds produced did not show DDD effects, indicating that conflicting demographic processes can disrupt the initial spatial pattern of tree investment in reproduction.
Synthesis. Understanding complex spatial effects of DDD processes requires dissection of component processes to attain the complete picture since contrasting DDD processes may be hidden behind a single cumulative measure of reproductive success. The combination of novel and classic mark correlation functions used here constitutes a powerful spatially explicit tool that can be broadly applied to unravel conflicting mechanisms of DDD regulating the persistence of sessile organisms at a range of spatial scales. Our findings help to explain why some authors failed to find expected DDD of PRS and highlight the importance of detailed multiyear field studies on plant reproductive success.

TI  - Frequency-Dependent Competition Between Strains Imparts Persistence to Perturbations in a Model of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Transmission
PY  - 2021
AB  - In high-transmission endemic regions, local populations of {\it Plasmodium falciparum} exhibit vast diversity of the \textit{var} genes encoding its major surface antigen, with each parasite comprising multiple copies from this diverse gene pool. This strategy to evade the immune system through large combinatorial antigenic diversity is common to other hyperdiverse pathogens. It underlies a series of fundamental epidemiological characteristics, including large reservoirs of transmission from high prevalence of asymptomatics and long-lasting infections. Previous theory has shown that negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) mediated by the acquisition of specific immunity by hosts structures the diversity of \textit{var} gene repertoires, or strains, in a pattern of limiting similarity that is both non-random and non-neutral. A combination of stochastic agent-based models and network analyses has enabled the development and testing of theory in these complex adaptive systems, where assembly of local parasite diversity occurs under frequency-dependent selection and large pools of variation. We show here the application of these approaches to theory comparing the response of the malaria transmission system to intervention when strain diversity is assembled under (competition-based) selection vs. a form of neutrality, where immunity depends only on the number but not the genetic identity of previous infections. The transmission system is considerably more persistent under NFDS, exhibiting a lower extinction probability despite comparable prevalence during intervention. We explain this pattern on the basis of the structure of strain diversity, in particular the more pronounced fraction of highly dissimilar parasites. For simulations that survive intervention, prevalence under specific immunity is lower than under neutrality, because the recovery of diversity is considerably slower than that of prevalence and decreased \textit{var} gene diversity reduces parasite transmission. A Principal Component Analysis of network features describing parasite similarity reveals that despite lower overall diversity, NFDS is quickly restored after intervention constraining strain structure and maintaining patterns of limiting similarity important to parasite persistence. Given the described enhanced persistence under perturbation, intervention efforts will likely require longer times than the usual practice to eliminate \textit{P. falciparum} populations. We discuss implications of our findings and potential analogies for ecological communities with non-neutral assembly processes involving frequency-dependence.

TI  - SPECIES DIVERSITY PATTERNS DERIVED FROM SPECIES–AREA MODELS
PY  - 2002
AB  - Although area, species abundances, spatial distribution, and species richness have been central components of community ecology, their interrelationships are not com- pletely understood. To describe these interrelationships, we study and test three patterns regarding species richness using species-area models. The first one is the widely accepted generalization that states that the number of species monotonically increases with sampling area. The second pattern predicts the decrease in species richness with the increase of species dominance in a given area. The third one predicts that spatial aggregation of in- dividuals within species results in lower species richness in communities. These three generalizations were investigated by modeling and simulations. First, a random-placement species-area model was used to evaluate the effects of relative species abundances on species richness in a sampling area. Then, a nonrandom species-area model was derived which explicitly encompasses the spatial distributions of species; it served to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in spatial distributions on species richness. Species-area models were numerically evaluated using parameters estimated from a tropical rain forest com- munity, and simulations were conducted to support the numerical solutions. The three patterns regarding species diversity were consistently supported by the results. A discussion ensues, describing how the three patterns can be used to interpret and predict species diversity, and how they are supported by other diversity hypotheses. The three generaliza- tions suggest that, if we want to understand species diversity, we should go and look for mechanisms that influence the abundances and spatial distributions of species. If a mech- anism can make the species abundances more even, or their spatial distributions more regular, this factor likely contributes to species coexistence.

TI  - Maintenance of Plant Species Diversity by Pathogens
PY  - 2015
AB  - We present strong evidence that pathogens play a critical role in structuring plant communities and maintaining plant diversity. Pathogens mediate plant species coexistence through trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to pathogens and through pathogen specialization. Experimental tests of individual plant–pathogen interactions, tests of feedback through host-specific changes in soil communities, and field patterns and field experimentation consistently identify pathogens as important to plant species coexistence. These direct tests are supported by observations of the role of pathogens in generating the productivity gains from manipulations of plant diversity and by evidence that escape from native pathogens contributes to success of introduced plant species. Further work is necessary to test the role of pathogen dynamics in large-scale patterns of plant diversity and range limits, the robustness of coexistence to coevolutionary dynamics, the contribution of different pathogens, and the r...

TI  - Global signal of top-down control of terrestrial plant communities by herbivores.
PY  - 2018
AB  - The theory of "top-down" ecological regulation predicts that herbivory suppresses plant abundance, biomass, and survival but increases diversity through the disproportionate consumption of dominant species, which inhibits competitive exclusion. To date, these outcomes have been clear in aquatic ecosystems but not on land. We explicate this discrepancy using a meta-analysis of experimental results from 123 native animal exclusions in natural terrestrial ecosystems (623 pairwise comparisons). Consistent with top-down predictions, we found that herbivores significantly reduced plant abundance, biomass, survival, and reproduction (all P < 0.01) and increased species evenness but not richness (P = 0.06 and P = 0.59, respectively). However, when examining patterns in the strength of top-down effects, with few exceptions, we were unable to detect significantly different effect sizes among biomes, based on local site characteristics (climate or productivity) or study characteristics (study duration or exclosure size). The positive effects on diversity were only significant in studies excluding large animals or located in temperate grasslands. The results demonstrate that top-down regulation by herbivores is a pervasive process shaping terrestrial plant communities at the global scale, but its strength is highly site specific and not predicted by basic site conditions. We suggest that including herbivore densities as a covariate in future exclosure studies will facilitate the discovery of unresolved macroecology trends in the strength of herbivore-plant interactions.

TI  - Rare species advantage? Richness of damage types due to natural enemies increases with species abundance in a wet tropical forest
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary
1.The Janzen–Connell hypothesis (JC) is one potential mechanism to explain the maintenance of high alpha diversity of tree species in tropical forests, operating through differential pressure by natural enemies.
2.We proposed that this differing pressure could arise from the richness of damage types due to natural enemies (RDNE). Following a community compensatory trend (CCT), we hypothesized greater RDNE on common species than on rare species.
3.We evaluated this novel interpretation of the JC by assessing damage patterns on leaves, as a proxy for natural enemy species in 44 tree species. We first evaluated which abiotic and biotic factors affect RDNE. Then, we tested whether increasing RDNE leads to an increasing amount of foliar damage.
4.We found that RDNE 
Was affected by biotic environments: RDNE increased with mean seedling species abundance. RDNE was higher on species occurring near more closely related neighbours.
Was not impacted by abiotic factors. Yet, seedlings of shade-tolerant species hosted a higher RDNE than seedlings of shade-intolerant species.
Was positively correlated with amount of foliar damage at the species level.


5.Finally, we tested whether RDNE increased seedling mortality risk. We found that 
Foliar damage, species abundance and RDNE2 increased mortality risk.
Richness of damage types due to natural enemies linearly decreased mortality risk more strongly than RDNE2 increased it.
Seedling age decreased mortality risk.


6.Synthesis. The richness of damage types due to natural enemies increased with abundance of the host species, suggesting an important role of enemy diversity in the maintenance of tree diversity. Supporting a novel interpretation of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, we found a greater mortality risk with increasing RDNE2, but not with increasing RDNE. There was a stronger negative linear effect of RDNE on mortality risk. Rare species with low RDNE as well as species with very high RDNE suffered greater mortality than species hosting intermediate RDNE, reinforcing the complexity of the effect of multiple enemies on prey.

TI  - A neighborhood analysis of the consequences of Quercus suber decline for regeneration dynamics in Mediterranean forests.
PY  - 2015
AB  - In forests, the vulnerable seedling stage is largely influenced by the canopy, which modifies the surrounding environment. Consequently, any alteration in the characteristics of the canopy, such as those promoted by forest dieback, might impact regeneration dynamics. Our work analyzes the interaction between canopy neighbors and seedlings in Mediterranean forests affected by the decline of their dominant species (Quercus suber). Our objective was to understand how the impacts of neighbor trees and shrubs on recruitment could affect future dynamics of these declining forests. Seeds of the three dominant tree species (Quercus suber, Olea europaea and Quercus canariensis) were sown in six sites during two consecutive years. Using a spatially-explicit, neighborhood approach we developed models that explained the observed spatial variation in seedling emergence, survival, growth and photochemical efficiency as a function of the size, identity, health, abundance and distribution of adult trees and shrubs in the neighborhood. We found strong neighborhood effects for all the performance estimators, particularly seedling emergence and survival. Tree neighbors positively affected emergence, independently of species identity or health. Alternatively, seedling survival was much lower in neighborhoods dominated by defoliated and dead Q. suber trees than in neighborhoods dominated by healthy trees. For the two oak species, these negative effects were consistent over the three years of the experimental seedlings. These results indicate that ongoing changes in species’ relative abundance and canopy trees’ health might alter the successional trajectories of Mediterranean oak-forests through neighbor-specific impacts on seedlings. The recruitment failure of dominant late-successional oaks in the gaps opened after Q. suber death would indirectly favor the establishment of other coexisting woody species, such as drought-tolerant shrubs. This could lead current forests to shift into open systems with lower tree cover. Adult canopy decline would therefore represent an additional factor threatening the recruitment of Quercus forests worldwide.

TI  - The role of soil communities on the germination of a pioneer tree species in the Atlantic rainforest
PY  - 2022
AB  - Climate change has been modifying precipitation and temperature in many regions of the world, prompting changes in plant communities. It also affects soil microbial communities, indirectly influencing plant species distribution through plant-soil feedbacks. Here we report an experiment designed to test seed germination responses to global change, addressed through the interaction between increased temperature and soil microbial communities in a tree species in the Atlantic rainforest, a global biodiversity hotspot. Our objective was to test plant-soil feedbacks in an early colonizer tree species, Schizolobium parahyba, and their interaction with warming. We assessed the role of increased air temperature and soil microbiota in controlling seed germination as a function of distance to mother tree. Higher germination percentages were recorded with extracts of soil microbial communities from the edge of the canopy than with microbial extracts obtained closer to the trunk. These manipulations evidenced that soil microbiota influenced seed germination, being responsible for Janzen–Connell effects. Warming produced major changes in microbial composition but the effect on germination was unclear. Our results may help understand species distribution and coexistence in secondary patches of Atlantic rainforest under warmer conditions, and may contribute to the design of successful restoration programs.

TI  - How tree species fill geographic and ecological space in eastern North America.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background and Aims Ecologists broadly accept that the number of species present within a region balances regional processes of immigration and speciation against competitive and other interactions between populations that limit distribution and constrain diversity. Although ecological theory has, for a long time, addressed the premise that ecological space can be filled to ‘capacity’ with species, only with the availability of time-calibrated phylogenies has it been possible to test the hypothesis that diversification slows as the number of species in a region increases. Focusing on the deciduous trees of eastern North America, this study tested predictions from competition theory concerning the distribution and abundance of species.

Methods Local assemblages of trees tabulated in a previous study published in 1950 were analysed. Assemblages were ordinated with respect to species composition by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). Distributions of trees were analysed by taxonomically nested analysis of variance, discriminant analysis based on NMS scores, and canonical correlation analysis of NMS scores and Bioclim climate variables.

Key Results Most of the variance in species abundance and distribution was concentrated among closely related (i.e. congeneric) species, indicating evolutionary lability. Species distribution and abundance were unrelated to the number of close relatives, suggesting that competitive effects are diffuse. Distances between pairs of congeneric species in NMS space did not differ significantly from distances between more distantly related species, in contrast to the predictions of both competitive habitat partitioning and ecological sorting of species.

Conclusions Eastern deciduous forests of North America do not appear to be saturated with species. The distributions and abundances of individual species provide little evidence of being shaped by competition from related (i.e. ecologically similar) species and, by inference, that diversification is constrained by interspecific competition.

TI  - Species abundances and lifetimes: From neutral to niche-stabilized communities
PY  - 2013
AB  - We study a stochastic community model able to interpolate from a neutral regime to a niche partitioned regime upon varying a single parameter tuning the intensity of niche stabilization, namely the difference between intraspecific and interspecific competition. By means of a self-consistent approach, we obtain an analytical expression for the species abundance distribution, in excellent agreement with stochastic simulations of the model. In the neutral limit, the Fisher log-series is recovered, while upon increasing the stabilization strength the species abundance distribution develops a maximum for species at intermediate abundances, corresponding to the emergence of a carrying capacity. Numerical studies of species extinction-time distribution show that niche-stabilization strongly affects also the dynamical properties of the system by increasing the average species lifetimes, while suppressing their fluctuations. The results are discussed in view of the niche-neutral debate and of their potential relevance to field data.

TI  - Habitat Loss and Herbivore Attack in Recruiting Oaks
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Habitat fragmentation can intensify consumer attack on plants if herbivores stay longer, eat more extensively, or exhibit higher density at low resource availability; it may also reduce attack if consumers are dispersal limited and therefore fail to forage on smaller or more distant patches. Here we test these alternatives with a large-scale grassland fragmentation experiment, comparing vertebrate and invertebrate herbivory on seedlings of an oak species of central North America (Quercus ellipsoidalis) experiencing recruitment difficulties across its range. All seedlings suffered significant herbivore-based defoliation regardless of experimental context, confirming the influence of consumer pressure on recruiting oaks on contemporary landscapes. However, vertebrates and insects responded differently to fragmentation. Vertebrate grazing was unaffected by patch size or isolation – remnants were either periodically visited by foraging deer or colonized by small mammals that occasionally attacked see...

TI  - Abiotic and biotic drivers of seedling survival in a hurricane-impacted tropical forest.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. Many forests experience periodic, large-scale disturbances, such as hurricanes and cyclones, which open the forest canopy, causing dramatic changes in understorey light conditions and seedling densities. Thus, in hurricane-impacted forests, large variations in abiotic and biotic conditions likely shape seedling dynamics, which in turn will contribute to patterns of forest recovery. 2. We monitored 13 836 seedlings of 82 tree and shrub species over 10 years following Hurricane Georges in 1998 in a subtropical, montane forest in Puerto Rico. We quantified changes in the biotic and abiotic environment of the understorey and linked seedling dynamics to changes in canopy openness and seedling density, and to spatial variation in soil type, topography and tree density. 3. Canopy openness was highest when first measured after Hurricane Georges and dropped significantly within c. 3 years, while seedling densities remained high for c. 5 years post-hurricane. When all species and census intervals were analysed together, generalized linear mixed effects models revealed that canopy openness, seedling and adult tree densities were significant drivers of seedling survival. 4. The relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors changed over time. Separate analyses for each census interval revealed that canopy openness was a significant predictor of survival only for the first census interval, with lower survival at the highest levels of canopy openness. The effect of conspecific seedling density was significant in all intervals except the first, and soil type only in the final census interval. 5. When grouping species into life-history guilds based on adult tree susceptibility to hurricane damage, we found clear differences among guilds in the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on seedling survival. Seedlings of hurricane-susceptible and intermediate guilds were more strongly influenced by canopy openness, while seedlings of the hurricane-resistant group were less affected by conspecific seedling density. Individual species-level analyses for 12 common species, however, showed considerable variation among species within guilds. 6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that hurricanes shape species composition by altering understorey conditions that differentially influence the success of seedlings. Thus, predicted increases in the intensity and frequency of hurricanes in the Caribbean will likely alter seedling dynamics and ultimately the species composition in hurricane-impacted forests.

TI  - Mammal population regulation, keystone processes and ecosystem dynamics
PY  - 2003
AB  - The theory of regulation in animal populations is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of populations, the causes of mortality and how natural selection shapes the life history of species. In mammals, the great range in body size allows us to see how allometric relationships affect the mode of regulation. Resource limitation is the fundamental cause of regulation. Top-down limitation through predators is determined by four factors: (i). body size; (ii). the diversity of predators and prey in the system; (iii). whether prey are resident or migratory; and (iv). the presence of alternative prey for predators. Body size in mammals has two important consequences. First, mammals, particularly large species, can act as keystones that determine the diversity of an ecosystem. I show how keystone processes can, in principle, be measured using the example of the wildebeest in the Serengeti ecosystem. Second, mammals act as ecological landscapers by altering vegetation succession. Mammals alter physical structure, ecological function and species diversity in most terrestrial biomes. In general, there is a close interaction between allometry, population regulation, life history and ecosystem dynamics. These relationships are relevant to applied aspects of conservation and pest management.

TI  - Dispersal and recruitment limitation in native versus exotic tree species: life‐history strategies and Janzen‐Connell effects
PY  - 2010
AB  - Life-history traits of invasive exotic plants are typically considered to be exceptional vis-a-vis native species. In particular, hyper-fecundity and long range dispersal are regarded as invasive traits, but direct comparisons with native species are needed to identify the life-history stages behind invasiveness. Until recently, this task was particularly problematic in forests as tree fecundity and dispersal were difficult to characterize in closed stands. We used inverse modelling to parameterize fecundity, seed dispersal and seedling dispersion functions for two exotic and eight native tree species in closed-canopy forests in Connecticut, USA. Interannual variation in seed production was dramatic for all species, with complete seed crop failures in at least one year for six native species. However, the average per capita seed production of the exotic Ailanthus altissima was extraordinary:  40 times higher than the next highest species. Seed production of the shade tolerant exotic Acer platanoides was average, but much higher than the native shade tolerant species, and the density of its established seedlings ( 3 years) was higher than any other species. Overall, the data supported a model in which adults of native and exotic species must reach a minimum size before seed production occurred. Once reached, the relationship between tree diameter and seed production was fairly flat for seven species, including both exotics. Seed dispersal was highly localized and usually showed a steep decline with increasing distance from parent trees: only Ailanthus altissima and Fraxinus americana had mean dispersal distances  10 m. Janzen-Connell patterns were clearly evident for both native and exotic species, as the mode and mean dispersion distance of seedlings were further from potential parent trees than seeds. The comparable intensity of Janzen-Connell effects between native and exotic species suggests that the enemy escape hypothesis alone cannot explain the invasiveness of these exotics. Our study confirms the general importance of colonization processes in invasions, yet demon strates how invasiveness can occur via divergent colonization strategies. Dispersal limitation of Acer platanoides and recruitment limitation of Ailanthus altissima will likely constitute some limit on their invasiveness in closed-canopy forests.

TI  - Spatial patterns of tree species distribution in New Guinea primary and secondary lowland rain forest
PY  - 2016
AB  - Questions

How do spatial patterns of tree distribution and species co-occurrence differ between primary and secondary tropical rain forests? What signatures of ecological processes might be discerned by comparing the spatial patterns of trees between primary and secondary forest plots?



Location

Tropical rain forest vegetation, lowlands of Papua New Guinea.



Methods

All trees over 5 cm DBH were surveyed in two non-replicated 1-ha plots situated in primary and secondary forest. Grid location, DBH, height and species identity were recorded for all surveyed trees. Analysis of the spatial pattern and the autocorrelation of tree sizes and identities were used to assess the structure of the forest found within the plots. Functions combining Ripley's K and the individual species–area relationship were applied to study the spatial distribution of trees and species diversity.



Results

The spatial distribution of common species, and all stems collectively, was aggregated in the secondary forest plot but not different from random in the primary forest plot. Diameter and height were also strongly spatially auto-correlated in the secondary forest plot but not in the primary forest plot. Conspecific aggregations were more common in the secondary forest plot. Finally, the secondary forest plot was characterized by the presence of diversity-repelling species and lower diversity than the primary forest plot, where diversity-accumulating species were present.



Conclusions

We attribute the weaker autocorrelation of tree size in the primary forest to the development of size hierarchies throughout the course of stand aging. The conspecific aggregation and low local diversity within the secondary forest plot are likely caused by dispersal limitation during a brief period of establishment after disturbance. The higher local diversity of the primary forest can be explained by the reduction of species aggregation through increased mortality of conspecifics. This is caused by strong intraspecific competition, supporting the spatial segregation hypothesis (interspecific spatial segregation).

TI  - Soil Fungal Community Composition Correlates with Site-Specific Abiotic Factors, Tree Community Structure, and Forest Age in Regenerating Tropical Rainforests.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Successional dynamics of plants and animals during tropical forest regeneration have been thoroughly studied, while fungal compositional dynamics during tropical forest succession remain unknown, despite the crucial roles of fungi in ecological processes. We combined tree data and soil fungal DNA metabarcoding data to compare richness and community composition along secondary forest succession in Costa Rica and assessed the potential roles of abiotic factors influencing them. We found a strong coupling of tree and soil fungal community structure in wet tropical primary and regenerating secondary forests. Forest age, edaphic variables, and regional differences in climatic conditions all had significant effects on tree and fungal richness and community composition in all functional groups. Furthermore, we observed larger site-to-site compositional differences and greater influence of edaphic and climatic factors in secondary than in primary forests. The results suggest greater environmental heterogeneity and greater stochasticity in community assembly in the early stages of secondary forest succession and a certain convergence on a set of taxa with a competitive advantage in the more persisting environmental conditions in old-growth forests. Our work provides unprecedented insights into the successional dynamics of fungal communities during secondary tropical forest succession.

TI  - An individual-based forest model to jointly simulate carbon and tree diversity in Amazonia: description and applications
PY  - 2017
AB  - Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual-based and spatially-explicit forest growth simulator, TROLL, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest. We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we validated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500 years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural characteristics similar to observations (e.g. leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model's sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coefficient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. TROLL should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.

TI  - Host plant phylogeny and abundance predict root‐associated fungal community composition and diversity of mutualists and pathogens
PY  - 2019
AB  - Interactions between plants and their root‐associated fungi (RAF) may influence the relative abundance of tree species and determine forest community diversity. Such plant–soil feedbacks in turn depend on the degree to which spatial distance and phylogenetic relatedness of host trees structure pathogen and mutualist communities, but research detailing these aspects of RAF communities is lacking. Here, we characterize plant–RAF associations across a diverse plant community, focusing on the degree to which RAF communities are structured by spatial distance, host phylogenetic relatedness, and host abundance. We compare results for different functional groups, including both putative mutualists and pathogens, an aspect poorly examined hitherto. We collected roots at regular intervals along ten 50 m by 2 m transects, then used DNA barcoding to identify host plants, and characterize the associated fungal community. Variance partitioning was used to measure the relative contributions of host phylogenetic relatedness and spatial distance to explaining RAF community composition. A weighted linear regression was used to measure the correlation between host abundance and RAF diversity. Phylogenetic distance among hosts was a better predictor of RAF community composition than spatial distance, but this relationship was stronger for putative pathogens than for mutualists, suggesting that pathogens show stronger host preference than mutualists. Across all functional groups, RAF showed similar levels of spatial structure. Additionally, RAF communities of locally abundant plants were less diverse than RAF communities of rare plants. Synthesis. We found that RAF communities are structured by the phylogenetic relatedness of hosts and, to a lesser extent, by spatial distance, with pathogens showing stronger host preference than mutualists. Abundant hosts had less diverse RAF communities than rare hosts, which is notable because abundant plants tend to experience weaker negative plant–soil feedback. Going forward, mechanisms underlying the host abundance‐RAF diversity relationship warrant further investigation. Additionally, the survey approach presented here could be paired with experiments linking RAF community composition to plant recruitment.

TI  - Community context for mechanisms of disease dilution: insights from linking epidemiology and plant─soil feedback theory
PY  - 2020
AB  - In many natural systems, diverse host communities can reduce disease risk, though less is known about the mechanisms driving this "dilution effect." We relate feedback theory, which focuses on pathogen-mediated coexistence, to mechanisms of dilution derived from epidemiological models, with the central goal of gaining insights into host-pathogen interactions in a community context. We first compare the origin, structure, and application of epidemiological and feedback models. We then explore the mechanisms of dilution, which are grounded in single-pathogen, single-host epidemiological models, from the perspective of feedback theory. We also draw on feedback theory to examine how coinfecting pathogens, and pathogens that vary along a host specialist-generalist continuum, apply to dilution theory. By identifying synergies among the feedback and epidemiological approaches, we reveal ways in which organisms occupying different trophic levels contribute to diversity-disease relationships. Additionally, using feedbacks to distinguish dilution in disease incidence from dilution in the net effect of disease on host fitness allows us to articulate conditions under which definitions of dilution may not align. After ascribing dilution mechanisms to macro- or microorganisms, we propose ways in which each contributes to diversity-disease and productivity-diversity relationships. Our analyses lead to predictions that can guide future research efforts.

TI  - Negative plant–soil feedback predicts tree-species relative abundance in a tropical forest
PY  - 2010
AB  - One potential mechanism for maintaining biodiversity is negative feedback between a species and its specific enemies, allowing rival species to thrive in the vicinity in preference to individuals of the species in question. The effect of soil biota has often been overlooked in the past, with more attention being paid to factors such as above-ground herbivory and resource partitioning. But a series of shade-house and field experiments now shows that in a tropical forest, it is the soil biota that is the main cause of this feedback, and that this effect is sufficient to explain the diversity. One potential mechanism for maintaining biodiversity is negative feedback between a species and its specific enemies, meaning that other species can grow in its vicinity better than further individuals of the species in question. These authors show that in a tropical forest it is the soil biota that is the main cause of this feedback, and that this effect can explain the diversity. The accumulation of species-specific enemies around adults is hypothesized to maintain plant diversity by limiting the recruitment of conspecific seedlings relative to heterospecific seedlings1,2,3,4,5,6. Although previous studies in forested ecosystems have documented patterns consistent with the process of negative feedback7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, these studies are unable to address which classes of enemies (for example, pathogens, invertebrates, mammals) exhibit species-specific effects strong enough to generate negative feedback17, and whether negative feedback at the level of the individual tree is sufficient to influence community-wide forest composition. Here we use fully reciprocal shade-house and field experiments to test whether the performance of conspecific tree seedlings (relative to heterospecific seedlings) is reduced when grown in the presence of enemies associated with adult trees. Both experiments provide strong evidence for negative plant–soil feedback mediated by soil biota. In contrast, above-ground enemies (mammals, foliar herbivores and foliar pathogens) contributed little to negative feedback observed in the field. In both experiments, we found that tree species that showed stronger negative feedback were less common as adults in the forest community, indicating that susceptibility to soil biota may determine species relative abundance in these tropical forests. Finally, our simulation models confirm that the strength of local negative feedback that we measured is sufficient to produce the observed community-wide patterns in tree-species relative abundance. Our findings indicate that plant–soil feedback is an important mechanism that can maintain species diversity and explain patterns of tree-species relative abundance in tropical forests.

TI  - Janzen-Connell patterns are not the result of Janzen-Connell process: Oak recruitment in temperate forests
PY  - 2017
AB  - According to the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, seedling mortality is greater close to conspecific (or closely related) adult trees because of higher enemy pressure, ultimately increasing local tree-species diversity. However, this pattern (i.e. a decline of seedling performance close to conspecific or closely related adults) could also result from other processes: (1) heterospecific adults might positively affect seedlings; (2) conspecific (or closely related) adults might negatively affect seedlings by causing a deterioration of the microenvironment. We tested these hypotheses, accounting also for sizes of adults. We planted oak-seedlings in a temperate forest, characterized their adult neighbourhoods, measured 26 microenvironmental conditions, seedling mortality during one year, budburst and leaf herbivory. We detected Janzen-Connell-like patterns (frequent lack of budburst close to conspecific adults; high seedling mortality close to closely related adults) that were consistent with the Janzen-Connell process. However, these patterns were either counteracted by non-Janzen-Connell processes such as a favourable microenvironment or were weak with little explained variance. We detected Janzen-Connell-like patterns that were not consistent with the Janzen-Connell process: proximity to heterospecific adults per se decreased leaf herbivory partly due to microenvironmental effects, such that a lower leaf herbivory decreased seedling mortality. Overall, the spatial pattern of tree recruitment may resemble that predicted by Janzen-Connell but result from different processes: notably heterospecific adults creating refuges from enemies, facilitating the establishment of oaks below non-oaks without hindering their establishment below oaks.

TI  - Nonrandom Processes Maintain Diversity in Tropical Forests
PY  - 2006
AB  - An ecological community's species diversity tends to erode through time as a result of stochastic extinction, competitive exclusion, and unstable host-enemy dynamics. This erosion of diversity can be prevented over the short term if recruits are highly diverse as a result of preferential recruitment of rare species or, alternatively, if rare species survive preferentially, which increases diversity as the ages of the individuals increase. Here, we present census data from seven New and Old World tropical forest dynamics plots that all show the latter pattern. Within local areas, the trees that survived were as a group more diverse than those that were recruited or those that died. The larger (and therefore on average older) survivors were more diverse within local areas than the smaller survivors. When species were rare in a local area, they had a higher survival rate than when they were common, resulting in enrichment for rare species and increasing diversity with age and size class in these complex ecosystems.

TI  - Coexistence and relative abundance in plant communities are determined by feedbacks when the scale of feedback and dispersal is local
PY  - 2014
AB  - 1. Negative plant-soil feedback occurs when the presence of an individual of a particular species at a particular site decreases the relative success of individuals of the same species compared to those other species at that site. This effect favors heterospecifics thereby facilitating coexistence and maintaining diversity. Empirical work has demonstrated that the average strengths of these feedbacks correlate with the relative abundance of species within a community, suggesting that feedbacks are an important driver of plant community composition. Understanding what factors contribute to the generation of this relationship is necessary for diagnosing the dynamic forces that maintain diversity in plant communities.

2. We used a spatially explicit, individual-based computer simulation to test the effects of dispersal distance, the size of feedback neighbourhoods, the strength of pairwise feedbacks and community wide variation of feedbacks, community richness, as well as life-history differences on the dependence of relative abundance on strength of feedback.

3. We found a positive dependence of relative abundance of a species on its average feedback for local scale dispersal and feedback. However, we found that the strength of this dependence decreased as either the spatial scale of dispersal and/or the spatial scale of feedback increased. We also found that for spatially local (i.e. relatively small) scale interaction and dispersal, as the mean strength of feedbacks in the community becomes less negative, the greater the increase in abundance produced by a comparable increase in species-specific average feedback. We found that life-history differences such as mortality rate did not generate a pattern with abundance, nor did they affect the relationship between abundance and average feedback.

4. Synthesis. Our results support the claim that empirical observations of a positive correlation between relative abundance and strength of average feedback serves as evidence that local scale negative feedbacks play a prominent role in structuring plant communities. We also identify that this relationship depends upon local scale plant dispersal and feedback which generates clumping and magnifies the negative feedbacks.

TI  - Plant species abundance and phylogeny explain the structure of recruitment networks
PY  - 2019
AB  - Established plants can affect the recruitment of young plants, filtering out some and allowing the recruitment of others, with profound effects on plant community dynamics. Recruitment networks (RNs) depict which species recruit under which others. We investigated whether species abundance and phylogenetic distance explain the structure of RNs across communities. We estimated the frequency of canopy-recruit interactions among woody plants in 10 forest assemblages to describe their RNs. For each RN, we determined the functional form (linear, power or exponential) best describing the relationship of interaction frequency with three predictors: canopy species abundance, recruit species abundance and phylogenetic distance. We fitted models with all combinations of predictor variables, from which we simulated RNs. The best functional form of each predictor was the same in most communities (linear for canopy species abundance, power for recruit species abundance and exponential for phylogenetic distance). The model including all predictor variables was consistently the best in explaining interaction frequency and showed the best performance in predicting RN structure. Our results suggest that mechanisms related to species abundance are necessary but insufficient to explain the assembly of RNs. Evolutionary processes affecting phylogenetic divergence are critical determinants of RN structure.

TI  - Evolutionary diversification of bruchine beetles: Climate-dependent traits and development associated with pest status
PY  - 2011
AB  - A number of insect species infest human households and stored foods and products, leading to their designation as pests. Until recently, little was known about the factors driving the evolution of pests that feed on stored dry foods. Here, I review the effects of changes in climate and species interactions on the evolution and ecology of beetles that feed on dried seeds/grains. My review focuses on evidence that the host utilization by part of the species in the subfamily Bruchinae (Chrysomelidae) is a preadaptation for utilizing stored dry seeds and grains, thus leading to their status as a pest. These and other stored product pest beetles retain a higher percentage of water in their body, relative to the water content of their diet, than beetles that feed on fresh crops. I review the studies that have documented adaptation, acclimation and polyphenetic response to high temperatures and desiccation and/or made direct comparisons between these traits between developmental stages, populations and among higher taxonomic groups. Finally, I review evidence for the effects of environmental change on insect host-parasitoid and competitor assemblages.

TI  - Intrinsic dynamics of the regional community
PY  - 2015
AB  - Patterns of diversity within large regional biotas express the outcomes of processes, operating on both regional and local scales, that influence evolutionary diversification as well as the distribution and abundance of species. Regional analyses of species distributions suggest that neither ecological sorting of species based on their adaptations to the physical environment, nor interactions between competing species, adequately explain patterns of species richness. Potentially competing species appear to utilise broadly overlapping resources with similar proficiency. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses reveal that species abundances and distributions within regions vary independently of evolutionary relationship. This implies the existence of dynamic, species-specific controls on population growth, as could be applied by specialised pathogens or other antagonists. Here, I argue that the changing balance of coevolved interactions between hosts and their antagonists shapes the distribution and abundance of individual host populations as well as patterns of local species richness. Geographical expansion creates allopatric populations and thereby could promote diversification; contraction ultimately leads to extinction. This taxon-cycle dynamic links regional diversity and distribution to intrinsic biological interactions independently of extrinsic ecological conditions. These hypotheses emphasise the central importance of investigating the impacts of pathogens on species abundance and distribution, and the potential consequences of coevolutionary changes in pathogen-host relationships for species formation and extinction.

TI  - Making dispersal syndromes and networks useful in tropical conservation and restoration
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Dispersal syndromes and networks must be used cautiously in conserving and restoring seed-dispersal processes. In many tropical forests most tree and shrub species require dispersal by animals for local persistence and for migration in response to environmental change. The most important errors to avoid in practical use of both dispersal syndromes (suites of fruit and seed characteristics that attract different dispersal agents) and network modules (groups of interacting dispersal agents and plants bearing fruits or seeds that they eat) are: (1) assuming that use of fruit resources by fruit-eating animals implies effective seed dispersal; (2) assuming that superficially similar fruits imply equally effective dispersal by similar animals, and (3) assuming that fruit resources at issue support animal populations. This essay explores strengths and weaknesses of uses of dispersal syndromes and disperser networks modules in conservation and restoration. Examples include some that are consistent with expectations from syndrome categorization and some that are not. An unappreciated weakness in using either dispersal syndromes or network modules is that contingent foraging by animals in highly disturbed habitats, now comprising 60%–70% of tropical land biomes, may not resemble foraging choices or consequences in protected closed forests, where most research on tropical seed dispersal is done. General prescriptions for the future include maintaining or creating habitat heterogeneity in largely deforested landscapes where remnant closed forests still exist, and active restoration in landscapes where little heterogeneity remains. In both cases, adaptations of multiple frame-work tree approaches have the best chance of preserving or enhancing populations of animal-dispersed trees and their seed vectors, and in opening migration paths in response to climate change.

TI  - The ecology of predispersal insect herbivory on tree reproductive structures in natural forest ecosystems.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Plant-insect interactions are key model systems to assess how some species affect the distribution, the abundance, and the evolution of others. Tree reproductive structures represent a critical resource for many insect species, which can be likely drivers of demography, spatial distribution, and trait diversification of plants. In this review, we present the ecological implications of predispersal herbivory on tree reproductive structures by insects (PIHR) in forest ecosystems. Both insect's and tree's perspectives are addressed with an emphasis on how spatiotemporal variation and unpredictability in seed availability can shape such particular plant-animal interactions. Reproductive structure insects show strong trophic specialization and guild diversification. Insects evolved host selection and spatiotemporal dispersal strategies in response to variable and unpredictable abundance of reproductive structures in both space and time. If PIHR patterns have been well documented in numerous systems, evidences of the subsequent demographic and evolutionary impacts on tree populations are still constrained by time-scale challenges of experimenting on such long-lived organisms, and modeling approaches of tree dynamics rarely consider PIHR when including biotic interactions in their processes. We suggest that spatially explicit and mechanistic approaches of the interactions between individual tree fecundity and insect dynamics will clarify predictions of the demogenetic implications of PIHR in tree populations. In a global change context, further experimental and theoretical contributions to the likelihood of life-cycle disruptions between plants and their specialized herbivores, and to how these changes may generate novel dynamic patterns in each partner of the interaction are increasingly critical.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity and natural enemies promote coexistence of tropical tree species.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Negative population feedbacks mediated by natural enemies can promote species coexistence at the community scale through disproportionate mortality of numerically dominant (common) tree species. Simultaneously, associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can result in positive effects on tree populations. Coupling data on seedling foliar damage from herbivores and pathogens and DNA sequencing of soil AMF diversity, we assessed the effects of these factors on tree seedling mortality at local (1 m2) and community (16 ha plot) scales in a tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico. At the local scale, AMF diversity in soil counteracted negative effects from foliar damage on seedling mortality. At the community scale, mortality of seedlings of common tree species increased with foliar damage while rare tree species benefited from soil AMF diversity. Together, the effects of foliar damage and soil AMF diversity on seedling mortality might foster tree species coexistence in this forest.

TI  - Seed predation by insects across a tropical forest precipitation gradient
PY  - 2018
AB  - 1. Pre‐dispersal predation of seeds by insects can be an important source of plant mortality, with consequences for plant population dynamics and community diversity.

2. The intensity and host‐specificity of natural enemies, including seed predators, is predicted to vary systematically across environmental gradients. These trends could contribute to large‐scale patterns in diversity, such as the widely observed positive relationship between plant species richness and precipitation. However, fundamental information on inter‐ and intraspecific seed predation is lacking at the landscape scale.

3. We assessed the intensity of seed predation by insects at eight forest sites spanning a steep precipitation and plant species‐richness gradient in Panama. We dissected freshly abscised fruits and seeds of woody plants to measure rates of predation, and assessed host‐specificity by rearing insects from them.

4. On average, 22.6% of dissected seeds were predated across 31 host species. Species‐specific and site‐level seed predation rates and the number of seed predator species reared per host were not significantly associated with annual rainfall or dry season water deficit.

5. In total, 45 seed predator morphospecies were reared from seeds of 16 plant species. Host‐specificity was high, with 91% of seed predator morphospecies associated with just one plant species.

6. Our results support evidence that pre‐dispersal insect seed predators are highly host‐specific and exhibit great intraspecific, interspecific and landscape‐scale (i.e. between‐site) variation in seed predation intensity. Host‐specific seed predators, particularly those causing moderate to high seed predation rates, could influence plant population dynamics and local community structure.

TI  - Plant‐soil feedbacks as drivers of succession: evidence from remnant and restored tallgrass prairies
PY  - 2015
AB  - Plant-soil feedbacks can contribute to the coexistence of plant species and may predict the abundance of plant species within communities. Here, we test if plant-soil feedbacks act as drivers of secondary succession. We found that the strength of feedback experienced by a plant species was positively correlated with that species' successional stage, indicating that plant-soil feedbacks can contribute to shifts in plant species abundance during succession. We did not observe a significant relationship between strength of feedback and plant species abundance at our study sites, but the positive relationship of feedback and successional stage would generate positive relationships between feedback and the abundance of plant species in communities at equilibrium. This result is supported by spatially explicit simulation models that demonstrate the potential for plant-soil feedbacks to determine changes in species abundance over time and the increasing strength of the relationship between feedback and plant species abundance during succession.

TI  - VERTEBRATE RESPONSES TO SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN SEED PRODUCTION OF MAST-FRUITING DIPTEROCARPACEAE
PY  - 2000
AB  - To examine the interspecific reproductive synchrony of Dipterocarpaceae with vertebrate responses to seed availablity, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution and phenology of more than 2367 adult dipterocarp individuals of 54 species from March 1985 to January 1993 in the Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seven vegetational formations were sampled along an altitudinal gradient from peat swamp forest (5 m a.s.l. (above sea level)) across lowlands to upper montane zones (1100 m a.s.l.) that encompassed two upland valley complexes in a 15-km 2 area. Four significant reproductive events were documented: (1) a common lowland species reproduced outside of mast events in 1986 and in 1990; (2) a localized lowland ''minor'' mast event in 1986 in which 24.3% of the adult trees (21 spp.) participated; (3) a major community-wide mast event (92.8%, 48 spp.) in 1987, just 6 mo after the minor event; and (4) another major community-wide mast fruiting event after a 4-yr intermast interval (88%, 48 spp.) in 1991. West Kalimantan export records of illipe nut (Dipterocarpaceae: Shorea section Pachycarpae) from 1968 to 1997 were compiled as a baseline measure of the frequency and relative intensity of dipterocarp mast-fruiting events in the region ( CV 5 152%). A ''bumper crop'' occurred about every 5 6 2.6 yr (mean 6 1 SD; range 3-9 yr). Fruit production was significantly associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The 1987 and 1991 mast events monitored were the third and fourth largest export years in the province since 1968. Because of the disputed role of vertebrate seed predators in causing and maintaining mast-fruiting behavior, the response of seed-eating vertebrates to this spatiotemporal variation in dipterocarp seed production was examined. Seed of a common, but asynchronous, lowland species was largely consumed by vertebrates. In the 1986 minor mast, 21 dipterocarp species that produced 60 000 seeds/ha (dry mass 46 kg/ha) lost all monitored viable seed to a diversity of resident and nomadic vertebrate seed predators. Timed with dipterocarp seed production in all mast events, nomadic vertebrates increased their pop- ulations through both reproduction and regional movement (numerical response). However, in both the 1987 and 1991 mast events, resident vertebrates destroyed only 1.5% and 2.6% of community seed production, and predation was recorded only in the tails of the fruit-fall distribution. During these community mast events, resident vertebrates switched from dipterocarp seed to feed on fruit and seed from other available species. Nomadic vertebrates arrived late in the fruit-fall period during both major mast events and, thus, were able to destroy only seed dispersed in the final 1-3 wk of fruit-fall. Seed escape, and thus regeneration, only occurred in major mast events when all dipterocarp species across large areas participated. Considerable seedling recruitment was recorded in both the 1987 ( ;95 000 seedlings/ha) and 1991 (155 824 6 36 764 seedlings/ha) mast events. Results from this natural experiment indicate that resident and nomadic vertebrates cause stabilizing selection for tight interspecific synchrony of dipterocarp seedfall over vast regions. Although the pattern generally conformed to the predator-satiation hypothesis, the observed mechanisms for seed escape within a mast-fruiting event did not. Resident and nomadic vertebrate foraging and ranging patterns resulted in dipterocarp seed ''escape'' rather than local ''swamping'' with copious seed production per se. To account for these observations, two hypotheses, ''interfamilial satiation'' and ''regional escape,'' were developed. The period of seed availability and length of the regional intermast interval is examined with seed-predator reproduction and behavior to assess the impact of seed availability on seed-predator populations.

Conclusions 377 Acknowledgements 377 References 377 SUMMARY: Lianas constitute a diverse polyphyletic plant group that is advancing our understanding of ecological theory. Specifically, lianas are providing new insights into the mechanisms that control plant distribution and diversity maintenance. For example, there is now evidence that a single, scalable mechanism may explain local, regional, and pan-tropical distribution of lianas, as well as the maintenance of liana species diversity. The ability to outcompete trees under dry, stressful conditions in seasonal forests provides lianas a growth advantage that, over time, results in relatively high abundance in seasonal forests and low abundance in aseasonal forests. Lianas may also gain a similar growth advantage following disturbance, thus explaining why liana density and diversity peak following disturbance at the local, forest scale. The study of ecology, however, is more than the effect of the environment on organisms; it also includes the effects of organisms on the environment. Considerable empirical evidence now indicates that lianas substantially alter their environment by consuming resources, suppressing tree performance, and influencing emergent properties of forests, such as ecosystem functioning, plant and animal diversity, and community composition. These recent studies using lianas are transcending classical tropical ecology research and are now providing novel insights into fundamental ecological theory.

TI  - A genetic evaluation of seed dispersal in the neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia (Bignoniaceae).
PY  - 2005
AB  - Abstract: Seed dispersal is a critical but poorly understood life‐history stage of plants. Here we use a genetic approach to describe seed dispersal patterns accurately in a natural population of the Neotropical tree species Jacaranda copaia (Bignoniaceae). We used microsatellite genotypes from maternally derived tissue on the diaspore to identify which individual of all possible adult trees in the population was the true source of a given seed collected after it dispersed. Wind‐dispersed seeds were captured in two different years in a large array of seed traps in an 84‐ha mapped area of tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We were particularly interested in the proportion of seeds that traveled long distances and whether there was evidence for direct dispersal into gaps, which are required for successful recruitment of this pioneer tree species. Maximum likelihood procedures were used to fit single‐ and multiple‐component dispersal kernels to the distance data. Mixture models, with separate ...

TI  - Tropical forests can maintain hyperdiversity because of enemies.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Explaining the maintenance of tropical forest diversity under the countervailing forces of drift and competition poses a major challenge to ecological theory. Janzen-Connell effects, in which host-specific natural enemies restrict the recruitment of juveniles near conspecific adults, provide a potential mechanism. Janzen-Connell is strongly supported empirically, but existing theory does not address the stable coexistence of hundreds of species. Here we use high-performance computing and analytical models to demonstrate that tropical forest diversity can be maintained nearly indefinitely in a prolonged state of transient dynamics due to distance-responsive natural enemies. Further, we show that Janzen-Connell effects lead to community regulation of diversity by imposing a diversity-dependent cost to commonness and benefit to rarity. The resulting species-area and rank-abundance relationships are consistent with empirical results. Diversity maintenance over long time spans does not require dispersal from an external metacommunity, speciation, or resource niche partitioning, only a small zone around conspecific adults in which saplings fail to recruit. We conclude that the Janzen-Connell mechanism can explain the maintenance of tropical tree diversity while not precluding the operation of other niche-based mechanisms such as resource partitioning.

TI  - Effects of soil microbes on plant competition: a perspective from modern coexistence theory
PY  - 2019
AB  - Growing evidence shows that soil microbes affect plant coexistence in a variety of systems. However, since these systems vary in the impacts microbes have on plants and in the ways plants compete with each other, it is challenging to integrate results into a general predictive theory. To this end, we suggest that the concepts of niche and fitness difference from modern coexistence theory should be used to contextualize how soil microbes contribute to plant coexistence. Synthesizing a range of mechanisms under a general plant–soil microbe interaction model, we show that, depending on host specificity, both pathogens and mutualists can affect the niche difference between competing plants. However, we emphasize the need to also consider the effect of soil microbes on plant fitness differences, a role often overlooked when examining their role in plant coexistence. Additionally, since our framework predicts that soil microbes modify the importance of plant–plant competition relative to other factors for determining the outcome of competition, we suggest that experimental work should simultaneously quantify microbial effects and plant competition. Thus, we propose experimental designs that efficiently measure both processes and show how our framework can be applied to identify the underlying drivers of coexistence. Using an empirical case study, we demonstrate that the processes driving coexistence can be counterintuitive, and that our general predictive framework provides a better way to identify the true processes through which soil microbes affect coexistence.

TI  - Exploring the Phylogenetic Structure of Ecological Communities: An Example for Rain Forest Trees
PY  - 2000
AB  - abstract: Because of the correlation expected between the phylogenetic relatedness of two taxa and their net ecological similarity, a measure of the overall phylogenetic relatedness of a community of interacting organisms can be used to investigate the contemporary ecological processes that structure community composition. I describe two indices that use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees (≥10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modifications to the basic m...

TI  - Edge effects alter the role of fungi and insects in mediating functional composition and diversity of seedling recruits in a fragmented tropical forest
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background and aims In fragmented forests, proximity to forest edges can favor the establishment of resource-acquisitive species over more resource-conservative species. During seedling recruitment, resource-acquisitive species may benefit from either higher light availability or weaker top-down effects of natural enemies. The relative importance of light and enemies for recruitment has seldom been examined with respect to edge effects. Methods In a human-modified wet tropical forest in India, we first examined how functional traits indicative of resource-acquisitive vs. resource-conservative strategies-specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), wood density, and seed size-explained interspecific differences in densities of seedling recruits with distance to forest edge. Then, we checked whether fungicide and insecticide treatments and canopy openness (proxy for light availability) explained edge effects on trait-mediated changes in seedling density. Finally, we examined whether light availability and natural enemy activity explained edge effects on functional diversity of seedling recruits. Key results Up to 60 m from edges, recruit densities increased with decreasing seed size, but not at 90-100 m, where recruit densities increased with higher SLA. Trait-mediated variation in recruit densities changed with pesticides only at 90-100 m: compared to control plots, fungicide increased recruit densities for low SLA species and insecticide increased smaller-seeded species. For SLA, wood density, and seed size, functional diversity of recruits was higher at 90-100 m than at 0-5 m. At 90-100 m, fungicide decreased functional diversity for SLA and insecticide reduced seed size diversity compared to control plots. Canopy openness explained neither variation in recruit density in relation to traits nor functional diversity. Conclusions Altered biotic interactions can mediate local changes to trait composition and functional diversity during seedling recruitment in forest fragments, hinting at downstream effects on the structure and function of human-modified forests.

TI  - Multiple natural enemies cause distance-dependent mortality at the seed-to-seedling transition.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Specialised natural enemies maintain forest diversity by reducing tree survival in a density- or distance-dependent manner. Fungal pathogens, insects and mammals are the enemy types most commonly hypothesised to cause this phenomenon. Still, their relative importance remains largely unknown, as robust manipulative experiments have generally targeted a single enemy type and life history stage. Here, we use fungicide, insecticide and physical exclosure treatments to isolate the impacts of each enemy type on two life history stages (germination and early seedling survival) in three tropical tree species. Distance dependence was evident for five of six species-stage combinations, with each enemy type causing distance dependence for at least one species stage and their importance varying widely between species and stages. Rather than implicating one enemy type as the primary agent of this phenomenon, our field experiments suggest that multiple agents acting at different life stages collectively contribute to this diversity-promoting mechanism.

TI  - Localized neighborhood species mingling is correlated with individual tree size inequality in natural forests in South China
PY  - 2021
AB  - We identified the significant spatial relationships between tree species mingling and size inequality in various species-rich natural forests in South China. Forest communities with low species mingling, or segregation of heterospecific trees, exhibited increased segregation of trees with dissimilar sizes. Large trees were more likely to be associated with high species mingling, and variation in neighboring tree sizes would also increase neighborhood species diversity. Numerous hypotheses such as Janzen–Connell and herd immunity effects have been proposed to explain the coexistence of diverse species in plant communities. However, these mechanisms for maintaining diversity have been studied primarily through the lens of species diversity, whereas tree size diversity or relationships between size and species diversity resulting from local interactions have rarely been investigated. We aimed to identify relationships between spatial species mingling and tree size inequality using extensive plot data from species-rich forest ecosystems. We applied neighborhood-based methods and explored relationships between spatial species mingling and size inequality indices in 22 large forest plots (30 ha in total) in subtropical and tropical China. Forest communities with low species mingling, or segregation of heterospecific trees, exhibited increased segregation of trees with dissimilar sizes. In most plots, large trees (e.g., dbh > 30 cm) were extensively associated with high species mingling, and individual-tree neighborhood species and size diversity were closely correlated. Our findings suggest that both the spatial patterns of conspecific dispersal and neighborhood interactions play an important role in determining the spatial patterns of tree size and species diversity and eventually in shaping the structure of forest communities.

TI  - Seed predation increases from the Arctic to the Equator and from high to low elevations
PY  - 2019
AB  - Species interactions have long been predicted to increase in intensity toward the tropics and low elevations because of gradients in climate, productivity, or biodiversity. Despite their importance for understanding global ecological and evolutionary processes, plant-animal interaction gradients are particularly difficult to test systematically across large geographic gradients, and evidence from smaller, disparate studies is inconclusive. By systematically measuring postdispersal seed predation using 6995 standardized seed depots along 18 mountains in the Pacific cordillera, we found that seed predation increases by 17% from the Arctic to the Equator and by 17% from 4000 meters above sea level to sea level. Clines in total predation, likely driven by invertebrates, were consistent across treeline ecotones and within continuous forest and were better explained by climate seasonality than by productivity, biodiversity, or latitude. These results suggest that species interactions play predictably greater ecological and evolutionary roles in tropical, lowland, and other less seasonal ecosystems.

TI  - The role of avian 'seed predators' as seed dispersers
PY  - 2010
AB  - Seed dispersal is a central process in plant ecology with consequences for species composition and habitat structure. Some bird species are known to disperse the seeds they ingest, whereas others, termed ‘seed predators’, digest them and apparently play no part in dispersal, but it is not clear if these are discrete strategies or simply the ends of a continuum. We assessed dispersal effectiveness by combining analysis of faecal samples and bird density. The droppings of seed dispersers contained more entire seeds than those of typical seed predators, but over a quarter of the droppings of seed predators contained whole seeds. This effect was further magnified when bird density was taken into account, and was driven largely by one frequent interaction: the Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, a typical seed predator and the most abundant bird species in the area and dispersed seeds of Leycesteria formosa, a non-native plant with berry-like fruits. These results suggest the existence of a continuum between seed predators and seed dispersers.

TI  - Seed transfer among bird-dispersed trees and its consequences for post-dispersal seed fate
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary We investigated seed transfer, i.e. the seed movement away from a source canopy to areas beneath heterospecific canopies, among the ornithochorous tree species Taxus baccata, Ilex aquifolium and Crataegus monogyna in temperate secondary forests in NW Spain, by analysing the composition of multispecific seed rain beneath the canopy of each species, at four sites and for 2 years. To evaluate the consequences on seed fate, we estimated predation by rodents in manipulated seed rains, representing variable levels of relative proportion and total density for combinations of a preferred species paired with a less-preferred species. Seed rain under Taxus canopies was dominated by Taxus seeds, which occurred in low proportion under heterospecific canopies. Ilex seeds dominated the areas under Ilex but accounted for 20–40% of seeds under heterospecific trees. Crataegus seeds were not dominant in any of the microhabitats. The probability of being deposited beneath a heterospecific canopy was much higher for Ilex and Crataegus than for Taxus. The effects of seed rain composition on post-dispersal seed predation were species-specific. Taxus seeds experienced lower predation when occurring in a background of seeds dominated by heterospecific, Ilex or Crataegus, seeds. Crataegus seeds escaped predation more successfully in high-density patches, independently of seed clump composition. Predation on Ilex seeds was independent to both the density and the composition of seed clump. Seed transfer among heterospecific tree species may contribute to shape the template of propagule abundances from which forest will develop, by generating seed combinations favourable to escape from predation.

TI  - Species Associations in a Heterogeneous Sri Lankan Dipterocarp Forest
PY  - 2007
AB  - We used point pattern analysis to examine the spatial distribution of 46 common tree species (diameter at breast height 110 cm) in a fully mapped -m tropical forest plot in Sin- 500 # 500 haraja, Sri Lanka. We aimed to disentangle the effect of species in- teractions (second-order effects) and environment (first-order ef- fects) on the species' spatial distributions. To characterize first-order associations (segregation, overlap), we developed a classification scheme based on Ripley's K and nearest-neighbor statistics. We sub- sequently used heterogeneous Poisson null models, accounting for possible environmental heterogeneity, to reveal significant uni- and bivariate second-order interactions (regularity, aggregation and re- pulsion, attraction). First-order effects were strong; overall, 53% of all species pairs occupied largely disjoint areas (segregation), 40% showed partial overlap, and 6% overlapped. Only 5% of all species pairs showed significant second-order effects, but about half of the species showed significant intraspecific effects. Significant plant-plant interactions occurred mostly within 2-4 m and disappeared within 15-20 m of the focal plant. While lack of significant species inter- actions suggests support for the unified neutral theory, species' ob- served spatial segregation does not support the assumptions of the neutral theory. The strong observed tendency of species to segregate may have supplementary effects on other processes promoting species coexistence.

TI  - On the factors that promote the diversity of herbivorous insects and plants in tropical forests
PY  - 2015
AB  - Some of the most fascinating and challenging questions in ecology are why biodiversity is highest in tropical forests and whether the factors involved are unique to these habitats. I did a worldwide test of the hypotheses that plant community divergence in antiherbivore traits results in higher insect herbivore diversity, and that predominant attack by specialized herbivores promotes plant richness. I found strong correlative support for both ideas. Butterfly diversity was greatest in regions where the community average species-pairwise dissimilarity in antiherbivore traits among plant species was highest. There was also a strong positive relationship between specialized (insect) vs. generalized (mammal) herbivores and plant richness. Regions where herbivory impact by mammals was higher than that of insects tended to have lower plant diversities. In contrast, regions in which insects are the main consumers, particularly in the Central and South American tropics, had the highest plant richness. Latitude did not explain any residual variance in insect or plant richness. The strong connections found between insect specialization, plant defense divergence, and plant and insect diversities suggest that increasing our understanding of the ecology of biological communities can aid in considerations of how to preserve biodiversity in the future.

TI  - Assessment of Habitat Suitability Is Affected by Plant-Soil Feedback: Comparison of Field and Garden Experiment.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Background 
Field translocation experiments (i.e., the introduction of seeds or seedlings of different species into different localities) are commonly used to study habitat associations of species, as well as factors limiting species distributions and local abundances. Species planted or sown in sites where they naturally occur are expected to perform better or equally well compared to sites at which they do not occur or are rare. This, however, contrasts with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis and commonly reported intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback. The few previous studies indicating poorer performance of plants at sites where they naturally occur did not explore the mechanisms behind this pattern.


Aims and Methods 
In this study, we used field translocation experiments established using both seeds and seedlings to study the determinants of local abundance of four dominant species in grasslands. To explore the possible effects of intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback on our results, we tested the effect of local species abundance on the performance of the plants in the field experiment. In addition, we set up a garden experiment to explore the intensity of intraspecific as well as interspecific feedback between the dominants used in the experiment.


Key Results 
In some cases, the distribution and local abundances of the species were partly driven by habitat conditions at the sites, and species performed better at their own sites. However, the prevailing pattern was that the local dominants performed worse at sites where they naturally occur than at any other sites. Moreover, the success of plants in the field experiment was lower in the case of higher intraspecific abundance prior to experimental setup. In the garden feedback experiment, two of the species performed significantly worse in soils conditioned by their species than in soils conditioned by the other species. In addition, the performance of the plants was significantly correlated between the two experiments, suggesting that plant-soil feedback is a likely explanation of the patterns observed in the field.


Conclusions 
All of the results indicate that intraspecific negative plant-soil feedback, either biotic or abiotic, may be a key factor determining the performance of the plants in our field translocation experiment. The possible effects of negative feedback should thus be considered when evaluating results of translocation experiments in future studies.

TI  - Foodwebs based on unreliable foundations: spatiotemporal masting merged with consumer movement, storage, and diet
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Mast‐fruiting trees represent a pulsed resource that both supports and destabilizes consumer populations. Whereas a reliable resource is abundant on average and with limited variation in time and space, masting is volatile and localized, and that variability ramifies throughout food‐webs. Theory is developed to evaluate how the space–time structure of masting interacts with consumers who exploit alternative hosts, forage widely in space, and store reserves in time. We derive the space–time–species covariance in resource supply and combine it with the space–time–diet breadth of consumers, or ambit. Direct connection to data is made possible with Mast Inference and Forecasting (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">MASTIF</jats:styled-content>), a state‐space autoregressive model that fits seed‐trap and canopy observations and predicts resource availability within the canopy and on the forest floor with full uncertainty. A resource score can be assigned to each consumer–habitat combination that integrates the benefits of a high mean supply weighed against the variance cost. As the consumer ambit increases, the volatility of an unreliable resource shifts from a variance cost to a mean benefit. Consumers foraging in the canopy (arboreal arthropods and rodents, song birds) experience space‐time covariance between host trees. Consumers on the forest floor (seed and damping‐off fungi, arthropods, rodents, ground‐nesting birds, mammals) experience instead a redistribution of that covariance by dispersal. For consumers lacking mobility, demographic storage in the form of episodic birth cohorts following mast years is important for population persistence. Consumers additionally compensate volatility with diet breadth. Depending on the dominant masting strategies of host tree species in the diet, habitats differentially limit consumers depending on the misalignment between consumer ambit and spatiotemporal covariance of hosts. The impact of adding or subtracting a diet item can be gauged with the standard error (<jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">SE</jats:styled-content>) rule or the benefit of an added diet item balanced against the variance cost, both of which depend on the existing diet, the abundance of the new host, and the consumer's foraging ambit. Results rank habitats by their capacities to support wildlife and other consumers from a resource perspective. Results are connected directly to data, with full uncertainty, by <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">MASTIF</jats:styled-content>.</jats:p>

PY  - 2019
AB  - In 1987, in the first issue of Conservation Biology, Edward O. Wilson wrote about the “little things that run the world” – the importance and conservation of insects (Wilson, 1987). Readers of Insect Conservation and Diversity will no doubt be very familiar with the concept. Sadly, however, this perception is not as widely shared among the rest of the scientific community as it should be, and insects are still comparatively neglected as a prime focus of scientific investigations.

TI  - Recruitment Distance from the Nearest Reproductive Conspecific Increases with Tree Size in Tropical Premontane Wet Forests
PY  - 2015
AB  - Studies have shown that median distances of plants from the nearest reproductive conspecific (recruitment distance) shifts outward with increasing age or size class, and that plant spatial distribution changes over time in a predictable manner. However, observations and empirical evidence for such predictable changes are limited, and underlying mechanisms explaining such patterns for a wide range of individual sizes are not fully explored. In Costa Rican premontane wet forests, I empirically tested whether recruitment distance changes in a predictable manner with increasing size for five animal-dispersed tree species by considering all post-germination sizes. Specifically, I tested the Janzen–Connell hypothesis and the colonization hypothesis by considering distance, density, size, herbivory, biotic infection, and light availability simultaneously. Recruitment distance increased with increasing size (16–22 m) for the four non-pioneer species, suggesting eventual regeneration success for seeds dispersed away from reproductive conspecifics. During the 2 years of this study, I found positive distance-dependent survivorship and light availability were important for post-seedling survivorship, in agreement with the Janzen–Connell hypothesis and the colonization hypothesis, respectively, but only for seedlings. However, seedlings did not escape aboveground herbivory or biotic infection better when the seeds were dispersed greater distances. Results highlight the importance of seed dispersal for successful regeneration, and suggest that changes in spatial distribution over time may be predictable in the vicinity of maternal trees for some non-pioneer tree species.

Resumen

Estudios han demostrado que la distancia media de los individuos a su mas cercano conspecifico reproductor (distancia de reclutamiento) se amplia con el aumento de la edad o clase de tamano, y que la distribucion espacial de las plantas puede cambiar con el tiempo de una manera predecible. Sin embargo, las observaciones y datos empiricos para tales los cambios previsibles son limitadas, y los mecanismos subyacentes que explican estos patrones para una amplia gama de tamanos individuales no son completamente explorado. En bosques humedos premonranos en Costa Rica, probe empiricamente si la distancia de reclutamiento cambia de una forma predecible con el aumento del tamano de cinco especies de arboles, dispersadas por animales, considerando todos los tamanos posteriores a la germinacion. En concreto, me demostrar la hipotesis Janzen-Connell y la hipotesis de colonizacion, considerando distancia, densidad, tamano, herbivoros, infeccion biotica, y disponibilidad de luz al mismo tiempo. La distancia de reclutamiento aumento con el aumento del tamano de (16-22 m) cuatro de las especies no pioneras, lo que sugiere un eventual exito de las semillas dispersadas lejos de sus conspecificos reproductivos. Durante los dos anos de este estudio, he encontrado supervivencia dependiente positivamente de la distancia y la disponibilidad de luz fueron importantes para la sobrevivencia posterior a la germinacion, de acuerdo con la hipotesis Janzen-Connell, pero solo para plantulas. Sin embargo, las plantulas no se escaparon mejor de la herbivoria o la infeccion biotica cuando se las semillas se dispersaron a mayor distancia. Resultados aqui resaltan la importancia de la dispersion de semillas para una regeneracion exitosa, y sugieren que cambios en la distribucion espacial en el tiempo puede ser predecible en las cercanias los arboles maternales para algunas especies de arboles no pioneras.

TI  - Natural Enemies and the Maintenance of Tropical Tree Diversity: Recent Insights and Implications for the Future of Biodiversity in a Changing World
PY  - 2020
AB  - Over the past five decades, many studies have examined the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which posits that host-specific natural enemies, such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens, promote plant species coexistence by providing a recruitment advantage to rare plant species. Recently, researchers have been exploring new and exciting angles on plant-enemy interactions that have yielded novel insights into this long-standing hypothesis. Here, we highlight some empirical advances in our understanding of plant-enemy interactions in tropical forests, including improved understanding of variation in plant species' susceptibility to enemy effects, as well as insect and pathogen host ranges. We then review recent advances in related ecological theory. These theoretical studies have confirmed that specialist natural enemies can promote tree diversity. However, they have also shown that the impact of natural enemies may be weakened, or that natural enemies could even cause species exclusion, depending on enemy host range, the spatial extent of enemy effects, and variation among plant species in seed dispersal or enemy susceptibility. Finally, we end by discussing how human impacts on tropical forests, such as fragmentation, hunting, and climate change, may alter the plant-enemy interactions that contribute to tropical forest diversity.

TI  - Effectiveness of predator satiation in masting oaks is negatively affected by conspecific density
PY  - 2018
AB  - Variation in seed availability shapes plant communities, and is strongly affected by seed predation. In some plant species, temporal variation in seed production is especially high and synchronized over large areas, which is called ‘mast seeding’. One selective advantage of this phenomenon is predator satiation which posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, and satiation in mast years. However, even though seed predation can be predicted to have a strong spatial component and depend on plant densities, whether the effectiveness of predator satiation in masting plants changes according to the Janzen-Connell effect has been barely investigated. We studied, over an 8-year period, the seed production, the spatiotemporal patters of weevil seed predation, and the abundance of adult weevils in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) population that consists of trees interspersed at patches covering a continuum of conspecific density. Isolated oaks effectively satiate predators, but this is trumped by increasing conspecific plant density. Lack of predator satiation in trees growing in dense patches was caused by re-distribution of insects among plants that likely attenuated them against food shortage in lean years, and changed the type of weevil functional response from type II in isolated trees to type III in trees growing in dense patches. This study provides the first empirical evaluation of the notion that masting and predator satiation should be more important in populations that start to dominate their communities, and is consistent with the observation that masting is less frequent and less intense in diverse forests.

TI  - Closing the gap in the Janzen-Connell hypothesis: What determines pathogen diversity?
PY  - 2023
AB  - The high tree diversity in tropical forests has long been a puzzle to ecologists. In the 1970s, Janzen and Connell proposed that tree species (hosts) coexist due to the stabilizing actions of specialized enemies. This Janzen-Connell hypothesis was subsequently supported by theoretical studies. Yet, such studies have taken the presence of specialized pathogens for granted, overlooking that pathogen coexistence also requires an explanation. Moreover, stable ecological coexistence does not necessarily imply evolutionary stability. What are the conditions that allow Janzen-Connell effects to evolve? We link theory from community ecology, evolutionary biology and epidemiology to tackle this question, structuring our approach around five theoretical frameworks. Phenomenological Lotka-Volterra competition models provide the most basic framework, which can be restructured to include (single- or multi-)pathogen dynamics. This ecological foundation can be extended to include pathogen evolution. Hosts, of course, may also evolve, and we introduce a coevolutionary model, showing that host-pathogen coevolution can lead to highly diverse systems. Our work unpacks the assumptions underpinning Janzen-Connell and places theoretical bounds on pathogen and host ecology and evolution. The five theoretical frameworks taken together provide a stronger theoretical basis for Janzen-Connell, delivering a wider lens that can yield important insights into the maintenance of diversity in these increasingly threatened systems.

TI  - JANZEN‐CONNELL EFFECTS ARE WIDESPREAD AND STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN DIVERSITY IN GRASSLANDS
PY  - 2008
AB  - Crop rotation schemes are believed to work by preventing specialist soil-borne pests from depressing the future yields of similar crops. In ecology, such negative plant-soil feedbacks may be viewed as a type of Janzen-Connell effect, which promotes species coexistence and diversity by preventing the same species from repeatedly occupying a particular site. In a controlled greenhouse experiment with 24 plant species and using soils from established field monocultures, we reveal community-wide soil-based Janzen-Connell effects between the three major functional groups of plants in temperate European grasslands. The effects are much stronger and more prevalent if plants are grown in interspecific competition. Using several soil treatments (gamma irradiation, activated carbon, fungicide, fertilizer) we show that the mechanism of the negative feedback is the buildup of soil pathogens which reduce the competitive ability of nearly all species when grown on soils they have formerly occupied. We further show that the magnitude of the change in competitive outcome is sufficient to stabilize observed fitness differences between functional groups in reasonably large communities. The generality and strength of this negative feedback suggests that Janzen-Connell effects have been underestimated as drivers of plant diversity in temperate ecosystems.

TI  - Competition, species interaction and ageing control tree mortality in boreal forests
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Tree mortality has important influences on forest structure and composition, but the mechanisms that cause tree mortality are not well understood. Asymmetric competition is known to be a dominant cause of plant mortality, but this idea has not received much attention in studies of longlived trees. 2. We hypothesised that while tree mortality is dependent on size relative to neighbours as a result of asymmetric competition, tree mortality of shade-tolerant species varies little with size because of their physiological and morphological adaptations to shaded environments. Furthermore, we hypothesised that tree mortality is higher in more crowded stands because of higher average resource competition, in conspecific stands because of potential negative intra-specific interactions, and in older stands because of the physiological limitations and susceptibility to minor disturbances of large trees. 3. Using data from repeatedly measured permanent sampling plots that covered a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in boreal forests, we simultaneously tested, by boosted regression tree models, the effects of an individual’s relative size, stand crowding, species interaction and ageing on mortality of Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana. 4. Mortality increased strongly with decreasing relative size for all study species, and the sizedependent mortality was stronger for shade-intolerant than for shade-tolerant species. With increasing stand basal area, mortality increased for Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Picea mariana but decreased for Betula papyrifera. Mortality was higher in stands with more conspecific neighbours for Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana, but was slightly lower for Pinus banksiana. Mortality also increased with stand age for all species. Furthermore, the sizedependent mortality was generally stronger in more crowded stands. 5. Synthesis. Our findings show that tree mortality over a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in non-equilibrium boreal forests was strongly controlled by competition, but species interactions and ageing were also important mechanisms. Furthermore, the relative importance of these mechanisms to tree mortality differed with the shade tolerance of species.

TI  - Habitat Endemism in White‐sand Forests: Insights into the Mechanisms of Lineage Diversification and Community Assembly of the Neotropical Flora
PY  - 2016
AB  - White-sand forests represent natural laboratories of evolution over their long history throughout Amazonia and the Guiana Shield and pose significant physiological challenges to the plants and animals they host. The study of diversification in plant lineages comprising species endemic to white-sand forest can therefore give insights into processes of evolution and community assembly in tropical forests. In this article, we synthesize recent studies of white-sand forests to integrate patterns of plant species distribution with processes of lineage diversification and community assembly in the white-sand flora. We contrast lineages that have radiated uniquely in these habitats (e.g., Pagamea, Rubiaceae), with cosmopolitan lineages comprising specialists to white-sand forests and other habitats that may have arisen via ecological speciation across habitat gradients (e.g., Protium, Burseraceae). In both cases, similar suites of functional traits have evolved, including investment in dense, long-lived tissues that are well-defended structurally and chemically. White-sand endemics, therefore, play an important role in biodiversity conservation because they represent unique combinations of functional and phylogenetic diversity. Furthermore, white-sand endemics may respond differently than other tropical forest plant species to contemporary global changes because they comprise resilient functional types that may better withstand increased drought, temperature, and invasions of exotic pests in these regions.

TI  - Edge Effects on Seedling Diversity Are Mediated by Impacts of Fungi and Insects on Seedling Recruitment but Not Survival
PY  - 2019
AB  - Growing awareness of the role of enemies in plant community dynamics has led to ecologists exploring how plant-enemy interactions change in human-modified systems. Proximity to forest edges was found to weaken the role of two groups of plant enemies—insect herbivores and fungal pathogens—in increasing plant diversity during the seed-to-seedling transition. However, it is less clear whether edge effects similarly compromise the diversifying effects of fungi and insects on established seedlings. We examined this question in a human-modified wet tropical forest in the Western Ghats of southern India. Over an annual cycle of recruitment, in 730 seedling plots (1 × 1 m each) arrayed at distances 0–100 m from the forest edge across 15 locations in a 30 km2 landscape, we suppressed the activity of fungal pathogens and insect herbivores by applying fungicide and insecticide to soil, seeds, and seedlings in a subset of plots. Suppressing fungi and insects reduced diversity mainly for seedling recruits and not for seedlings that had already established. However, pesticide effects were only apparent at 90–100 m from forest edges. Specifically, in the interior sites, fungi and insect activity increased recruit diversity, which helped maintain local seedling diversity even though diversity of established seedlings declined with annual mortality. By comparison, canopy openness affected neither the diversity of survivors from the initial seedling cohort nor total seedling diversity after an annual cycle of recruitment. Our results indicate that insects and fungi promote diversity more prominently during early seedling establishment rather than through impacts on post-establishment seedling survival. Thus, edge effects can weaken the diversifying effects of plant-insect and plant-fungal interactions during recruitment and thereby modify the seedling template available for the future tree community in human-modified forests.

TI  - Spatial patterns in the tropical forest reveal connections between negative feedback, aggregation and abundance
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract The spatial arrangement of trees in a tropical forest reflects the interplay between aggregating processes, like dispersal limitation, and negative feedback that induces effective repulsion among individuals. Monitoring the variance–mean ratio for conspecific individuals along length-scales, we show that the effect of negative feedback is dominant at short scales, while aggregation characterizes the large-scale patterns. A comparison of different species indicates, surprisingly, that both aggregation and negative feedback scales are related to the overall abundance of the species. This suggests a bottom-up control mechanism, in which the negative feedback dictates the dispersal kernel and the overall abundance.

TI  - Mutualisms weaken the latitudinal diversity gradient among oceanic islands.
PY  - 2024
AB  - The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) dominates global patterns of diversity<sup>1,2</sup>, but the factors that underlie the LDG remain elusive. Here we use a unique global dataset<sup>3</sup> to show that vascular plants on oceanic islands exhibit a weakened LDG and explore potential mechanisms for this effect. Our results show that traditional physical drivers of island biogeography<sup>4</sup>-namely area and isolation-contribute to the difference between island and mainland diversity at a given latitude (that is, the island species deficit), as smaller and more distant islands experience reduced colonization. However, plant species with mutualists are underrepresented on islands, and we find that this plant mutualism filter explains more variation in the island species deficit than abiotic factors. In particular, plant species that require animal pollinators or microbial mutualists such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute disproportionately to the island species deficit near the Equator, with contributions decreasing with distance from the Equator. Plant mutualist filters on species richness are particularly strong at low absolute latitudes where mainland richness is highest, weakening the LDG of oceanic islands. These results provide empirical evidence that mutualisms, habitat heterogeneity and dispersal are key to the maintenance of high tropical plant diversity and mediate the biogeographic patterns of plant diversity on Earth.

TI  - Plant–soil feedbacks and the dominance of conifers in a tropical montane forest in Borneo
PY  - 2017
AB  - We investigated consequences of plant–soil feedbacks (PSFs) in a tropical montane forest on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo by measurements of light and soil conditions, ecophysiological analyses of tree seedlings, a long-term adult and seedling census, and a simple simulation model. The study plot (2.74 ha) is in a mixed conifer–broadleaf forest with 24% relative basal area of conifers. First, we investigated light and soil conditions beneath two dominant species, a conifer Dacrydium gracilis (Podocarpaceae, arbuscular mycorrhizal tree) and a broadleaf Lithocaprus clementianus (Fagaceae, ectomycorrhizal tree). The relative light intensity was marginally higher beneath Dacrydium tree crown than beneath Lithocarpus tree crown. The concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and labile phosphorus, and the nitrogen mineralization rate, were lower beneath Dacrydium than beneath Lithocarpus, suggesting that soils beneath Dacrydium were more nutrient deficient. Microscopic observations confirmed that conifer seedlings (including Dacrydium) harbored arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, a molecular analysis showed that root-associated mycorrhizal fungal communities were clearly different between conifer and broadleaf seedlings, and consequently, nutrient acquisition capacity of seedlings may be different between them. Indeed, stable isotopic evidence suggested that Dacrydium seedlings are more efficient in inorganic nitrogen acquisition than Lithocarpus seedlings. These results predicted that the conifer seedlings would out-compete broadleaf seedlings and have a greater advantage beneath the conifer canopy. To test the possible advantage of conifer seedlings in performance, we developed hierarchical Bayesian models and estimated growth and mortality rates using the seedling census data during 2006–2012. We found that conifer seedlings performed better than broadleaf seedlings beneath Dacrydium canopy. On the other hand, broadleaf seedlings performed better than conifer seedlings beneath Lithocarpus canopy. The consequences of the PSFs for the tree community composition were investigated by developing a simple simulation model, and were compared with the results of a model without PSFs. After a 10 000-year simulation, the relative abundance of conifers with PSFs converged to 22%, which was consistent with the actual abundance; the model without effects of PSFs predicted a relative abundance of only ~10%. The results suggested that PSFs contributed to the maintenance of the conifer dominance in the tropical montane forest.

TI  - The Coexistence of Hosts with Different Abilities to Discriminate against Cheater Partners: An Evolutionary Game-Theory Approach
PY  - 2014
AB  - AbstractEvolutionary theory predicts that mutualisms based on the reciprocal exchange of costly services should be susceptible to exploitation by cheaters. Consistent with theory, both cheating and discrimination against cheaters are ubiquitous features of mutualisms. Several recent studies have confirmed that host species differ in the extent that they are able to discriminate against cheaters, suggesting that cheating may be stabilized by the existence of susceptible hosts (dubbed “givers”). We use an evolutionary game-theoretical approach to demonstrate how discriminating and giver hosts associating with mutualist and cheater partners can coexist. Discriminators drive the proportion of cheaters below a critical threshold, at which point there is no benefit to investing resources into discrimination. This promotes givers, who benefit from mutualists but allow cheater populations to rebound. We then apply this model to the plant-mycorrhizal mutualism and demonstrate it is one mechanism for generating hos...

TI  - Biotic and abiotic drivers of the tree growth and mortality trade-off in an old-growth temperate forest
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract The tree growth and mortality trade-off is well documented and plays a key role in forests by forming the basis of many ecosystem processes and contributing to tree species coexistence. One area that requires further understanding is how the growth-mortality trade-off is influenced by biotic and abiotic interactions in the forest. In this study, we used a 5-year interval of tree growth and mortality demographic data from a 9-ha forest dynamics plot in a temperate old-growth Chinese forest to address two questions, (1) What is the nature of the growth-mortality trade-off among species in this forest? (2) Are there differences between the responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables, both biotic and abiotic? Specifically, do these responses vary among species and with tree size? For the first question, we hypothesized that, within species, mortality rate would be negatively correlated with growth rate, whereas among species it would be positively correlated. For the second question, we expected biotic and abiotic factors to both be important for tree mortality; but expected biotic factors to be more important than abiotic factors for tree growth. The responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables, both biotic and abiotic, varied among species. Abiotic factors were more important than biotic factors for small trees; biotic variables were stable with tree size for both small and large trees. Our results showed that there were differences between the responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables (i.e., biotic and abiotic) in this temperate forest community. The responses of tree mortality to local neighborhood variables strongly varied across species. Abiotic factors were only important for the growth of small trees. Biotic factors were stable with tree size for growth of small and large trees, but not for mortality. Mortality was negatively correlated with growth for large trees within species; growth-mortality trade-off among species was found to be more accentuated for small trees. The responses of tree mortality to local neighborhood variables differed strongly across species, whereas the responses of tree growth to local neighborhood variables varied among size classes. Tree growth and mortality is tightly correlated both within (negatively) and among species (positively), and their relationships are both size dependent in this temperate forest. Our findings highlight that differential responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables continue to shape the forest community well after sapling establishment in this temperate forest community.

TI  - Soil community feedback and the coexistence of competitors: conceptual frameworks and empirical tests
PY  - 2003
AB  - A growing body of empirical work suggests that soil organisms can exert a strong role in plant community dynamics and may contribute to the coexistence of plant species. Some of this evidence comes from examining the feedback on plant growth through changes in the composition of the soil community. Host specific changes in soil community composition can generate feedback on plant growth and this feedback can be positive or negative. Previous work has demonstrated that negative soil community feedback can contribute to the coexistence of equivalent competitors. In this paper, I show that negative soil community feedback can also contribute to the coexistence of strong competitors, maintaining plant species that would not coexist in the absence of soil community dynamics. I review the evidence for soil community feedback and find accumulating evidence that soil community feedback can be common, strongly negative, and generated by a variety of complementary soil microbial mechanisms, including host-specific changes in the composition of the rhizosphere bacteria, nematodes, pathogenic fungi, and mycorrhizal fungi. Finally, I suggest topics needing further examination.

TI  - Competition and Coexistence in Plant Communities: Intraspecific Competition is Stronger Than Interspecific Competition
PY  - 2018
AB  - Theory predicts that intraspecific competition should be stronger than interspecific competition for any pair of stably coexisting species, yet previous literature reviews found little support for this pattern. We screened over 5400 publications and identified 39 studies that quantified phenomenological intraspecific and interspecific interactions in terrestrial plant communities. Of the 67% of species pairs in which both intra- and interspecific effects were negative (competitive), intraspecific competition was, on average, four to five-fold stronger than interspecific competition. Of the remaining pairs, 93% featured intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation, a situation that stabilises coexistence. The difference between intra- and interspecific effects tended to be larger in observational than experimental data sets, in field than greenhouse studies, and in studies that quantified population growth over the full life cycle rather than single fitness components. Our results imply that processes promoting stable coexistence at local scales are common and consequential across terrestrial plant communities.

TI  - When condition trumps location: seed consumption by fruit-eating birds removes pathogens and predator attractants
PY  - 2013
AB  - Seed ingestion by frugivorous vertebrates commonly benefits plants by moving seeds to locations with fewer predators and pathogens than under the parent. For plants with high local population densities, however, movement from the parent plant is unlikely to result in ‘escape’ from predators and pathogens. Changes to seed condition caused by gut passage may also provide benefits, yet are rarely evaluated as an alternative. Here, we use a common bird-dispersed chilli pepper (Capsicum chacoense) to conduct the first experimental comparison of escape-related benefits to condition-related benefits of animal-mediated seed dispersal. Within chilli populations, seeds dispersed far from parent plants gained no advantage from escape alone, but seed consumption by birds increased seed survival by 370% – regardless of dispersal distance – due to removal during gut passage of fungal pathogens and chemical attractants to granivores. These results call into question the pre-eminence of escape as the primary advantage of dispersal within populations and document two overlooked mechanisms by which frugivores can benefit fruiting plants.

TI  - Neighborhood Effects on Tree Mortality Depend on Life Stage of Neighbors.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Neighborhood effects are a crucial ecological processes that allow species to coexist in a forest. Conspecific and heterospecific neighbors, as major group classifications, affect tree mortality through various mechanisms associated with neighbor life stages. However, the influence of neighbor life stages on neighborhood effects and by what mechanisms remains a knowledge gap. Here we censused the mortality of 82,202 trees belonging to 30 species in a 20-ha subtropical forest and classified their neighbors into the following life stages: earlier, same and later. Next, we implemented generalized linear mixed models to estimate the effect of neighbors at different life stages on tree mortality. Our results showed that conspecific later stage neighbors had a positive effect on tree mortality overall, while conspecific earlier stage neighbors had a negative effect on tree mortality. Furthermore, these opposing effects appear to offset each other so that the overall effect of conspecific neighbors on tree mortality is weakened. In contrast, heterospecific neighbors had a decreasing effect on tree mortality overall. These effects are consistent with those of later stage heterospecific neighbors. Our findings demonstrate that neighbors strongly impact tree mortality, and their specific effects are closely related to neighbor life stages. Further, any single effect from one neighbor life stage may disturb or dominate the total effects of the neighbors. Therefore, the neighbors must be divided into different life stages to best explain the neighborhood effect on forest dynamics.

TI  - Influence of soils and topography on Amazonian tree diversity: a landscape-scale study
PY  - 2010
AB  - Question: How do soils and topography influence Amazonian tree diversity, a region with generally nutrient-starved soils but some of the biologically richest tree communities on Earth? Location: Central Amazonia, near Manaus, Brazil. Methods: We evaluated the influence of 14 soil and topographic features on species diversity of rain forest trees (� 10 cm diameter at breast height), using data from 63 1-ha plots scattered over an area of � 400 km 2 . Results: An ordination analysis identified three major edaphic gradients: (1) flatter areas had generally higher nutrient soils (higher clay content, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, pH and exchangeable bases, and lower aluminium saturation) than did slopes and gullies; (2) sandier soils had lower water storage (plant available water capacity), phosphorus and nitrogen; and (3) soil pH varied among sites. Gradient 2 was the strongest predictor of tree diversity (species richness and Fisher’s a values), with diversity increasing with higher soil fertility and water availability. Gradient 2 was also the best predictor of the number of rare (singleton) species, which accounted on average for over half (56%) of all species in each plot. Conclusions: Although our plots invariably supported diverse tree communities (� 225 species ha � 1 ), the most species-rich sites (up to 310 species ha � 1 )w ere least constrained by soil water and phosphorus availability. Intriguingly, the numbers of rare and common species were not significantly correlated in our plots, and they responded differently to major soil and topographic gradients. For unknown reasons rare species were significantly more frequent in plots with many large trees.

TI  - Bushmeat hunting changes regeneration of African rainforests
PY  - 2013
AB  - To assess ecological consequences of bushmeat hunting in African lowland rainforests, we compared paired sites, with high and low hunting pressure, in three areas of southeastern Nigeria. In hunted sites, populations of important seed dispersers-both small and large primates (including the Cross River gorilla, Gorilla gorilla diehli)-were drastically reduced. Large rodents were more abundant in hunted sites, even though they are hunted. Hunted and protected sites had similar mature tree communities dominated by primate-dispersed species. In protected sites, seedling communities were similar in composition to the mature trees, but in hunted sites species with other dispersal modes dominated among seedlings. Seedlings emerging 1 year after clearing of all vegetation in experimental plots showed a similar pattern to the standing seedlings. This study thus verifies the transforming effects of bushmeat hunting on plant communities of tropical forests and is one of the first studies to do so for the African continent.

AB  - Janzen-Connell effects (JCEs), specialised predation of seeds and seedlings near conspecific trees, are hypothesised to maintain species richness. While previous studies show JCEs can maintain high richness relative to neutral communities, recent theoretical work indicates JCEs may weakly inhibit competitive exclusion when species exhibit interspecific fitness variation. However, recent models make somewhat restrictive assumptions about the functional form of specialised predation-that JCEs occur at a fixed rate when offspring are within a fixed distance of a conspecific tree. Using a theoretical model, I show that the functional form of JCEs largely impacts their ability to maintain coexistence. If predation pressure increases additively with adult tree density and decays exponentially with distance, JCEs maintain considerably higher species richness than predicted by recent models. Loosely parameterising the model with data from a Panamanian tree community, I elucidate the conditions under which JCEs are capable of maintaining high species richness.

TI  - Functional genomics and co‐occurrence in a diverse tropical tree genus: The roles of drought‐ and defence‐related genes

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Tropical tree communities are among the most diverse in the world. A small number of genera often disproportionately contribute to this diversity. How so many species from a single genus can co‐occur represents a major outstanding question in biology.

TI  - Spatial distribution and association patterns in a tropical evergreen broad‐leaved forest of north‐central Vietnam
PY  - 2015
AB  - Questions
What are the prevailing types of intraspecific spatial distributions and interspecific association patterns at species and life stage levels of trees in a tropical rain forest? Which ecological processes could structure these patterns? Possible processes include dispersal limitation, self-thinning, facilitation and competition between species and life stages.

Location
A tropical broad-leaved forest in north-central Vietnam.

Methods
We used univariate and bivariate pair-correlation functions to investigate the spatial distribution and association patterns of 18 abundant tree species. To disentangle first- and second-order effects, we used a scale separation approach with the heterogeneous Poisson process as null model.

Results
(1) Sixteen of 18 species had aggregated patterns at various scales and regardless of their abundance. (2) Significant and aggregated patterns were found in 64% of all specific life stages. (3) At scales up to 15 m, 12.4% species pairs showed significant associations, among that 71% were spatial attractions, 5% were spatial repulsions and 24% were non-essential interactions. (4) In different life stage associations, attractions (81%) predominated over repulsions (19%) at small scales of up to 15 m.

Conclusions
Our findings provide evidence that dispersal limitation may regulate the spatial patterns of tree species. Moreover, positive spatial associations between tree species and life stages suggest the presence of species herd protection and/or facilitation in this forest stand, while the persistence of intraspecific aggregation through life stages suggests a very late onset or even absence of self-thinning. Habitat heterogeneity plays an important role for species distribution patterns, and the spatial segregation occurs at a scale around 15 m in this forest.

TI  - Large niche differences emerge at the recruitment stage to stabilize grassland coexistence
PY  - 2015
AB  - Niche differences and average fitness differences jointly determine coexistence. However, little empirical information about the magnitude of these two mechanisms is available. Using multispecies population models fit to long-term demographic data for common, co-occurring species in five grassland and shrubland plant communities in western North America, we estimated the strength of stabilizing niche differences and average fitness differences. In all five communities, both pairwise and full community comparisons showed evidence for strong stabilizing mechanisms and relatively small average fitness differences. For a total of 17 species pairs, a measure of niche differences based on simulations of invasion growth rates ranged from 0.59 to 0.93 with a mean of 0.81, where 0 indicates complete niche overlap and 1 indicates zero niche overlap. A corresponding measure of average fitness differences ranged from 1.02 to 2.54 with a mean of 1.53, where 1 indicates identical fitness and a value of 2 indicates a fo...

TI  - Incorporating the soil environment and microbial community into plant competition theory.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Plants affect microbial communities and abiotic properties of nearby soils, which in turn influence plant growth and interspecific interaction, forming a plant-soil feedback (PSF). PSF is a key determinant influencing plant population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functions. Despite accumulating evidence for the importance of PSF and development of specific PSF models, different models are not yet fully integrated. Here, we review the theoretical progress in understanding PSF. When first proposed, PSF was integrated with various mathematical frameworks to discuss its influence on plant competition. Recent theoretical models have advanced PSF research at different levels of ecological organizations by considering multiple species, applying spatially explicit simulations to examine how local-scale predictions apply to larger scales, and assessing the effect of PSF on plant temporal dynamics over the course of succession. We then review two foundational models for microbial- and litter-mediated PSF. We present a theoretical framework to illustrate that although the two models are typically presented separately, their behavior can be understood together by invasibility analysis. We conclude with suggestions for future directions in PSF theoretical studies, which include specifically addressing microbial diversity to integrate litter- and microbial-mediated PSF, and apply PSF to general coexistence theory through a trait-based approach.

TI  - Neighboring Trees Regulate the Root-Associated Pathogenic Fungi on the Host Plant in a Subtropical Forest
PY  - 2020
AB  - Root-associated fungi and host-specific pathogens are major determinants of species coexistence in forests. Phylogenetically related neighboring trees can strongly affect the fungal community structure of the host plant, which, in turn, will affect the ecological processes. Unfortunately, our understanding of the factors influencing fungal community composition in forests is still limited. In particular, investigation of the relationship between the phytopathogenic fungal community and neighboring trees is incomplete. In the current study, we tested the host specificity of members of the root-associated fungal community collected from seven tree species and determined the influence of neighboring trees and habitat variation on the composition of the phytopathogenic fungal community of the focal plant in a subtropical evergreen forest. Using high-throughput sequencing data with respect to the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, we characterized the community composition of the root-associated fungi and found significant differences with respect to fungal groups among the seven tree species. The density of conspecific neighboring trees had a significantly positive influence on the relative abundance of phytopathogens, especially host-specific pathogens, while the heterospecific neighbor density had a significant negative impact on the species richness of host-specific pathogens, as well as phytopathogens. Our work provides evidence that the root-associated phytopathogenic fungi of a host plant depend greatly on the tree neighbors of the host plant.

TI  - The glocal forest.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Spatial ecological patterns reflect the underlying processes that shape the structure of species and communities. Mechanisms like intra- and inter-specific competition, dispersal and host-pathogen interactions can act over a wide range of scales. Yet, the inference of such processes from patterns is a challenging task. Here we call attention to a quite unexpected phenomenon in the extensively studied tropical forest at the Barro-Colorado Island (BCI): the spatial deployment of (almost) all tree species is statistically equivalent, once distances are normalized by l0, the typical distance between neighboring conspecific trees. Correlation function, cluster statistics and nearest-neighbor distance distribution become species-independent after this rescaling. Global observables (species frequencies) and local spatial structure appear to be interrelated. This "glocality" suggests a radical interpretation of recent experiments that show a correlation between species' abundance and the negative feedback among conspecifics. For the forest to be glocal, the negative feedback must govern spatial patterns over all scales.

TI  - How specialised must natural enemies be to facilitate coexistence among plants
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that plant interactions with host-specific antagonists can impair the fitness of locally abundant species and thereby facilitate coexistence. However, insects and pathogens that associate with multiple hosts may mediate exclusion rather than coexistence. We employ a simulation model to examine the effect of enemy host breadth on plant species richness and defence community structure, and to assess expected diversity maintenance in example systems. Only models in which plant enemy similarity declines rapidly with defence similarity support greater species richness than models of neutral drift. In contrast, a wide range of enemy host breadths result in spatial dispersion of defence traits, at both landscape and local scales, indicating that enemy-mediated competition may increase defence-trait diversity without enhancing species richness. Nevertheless, insect and pathogen host associations in Panama and Papua New Guinea demonstrate a potential to enhance plant species richness and defence-trait diversity comparable to strictly specialised enemies.

TI  - Global woodland structure from local interactions: new nearest-neighbour functions for understanding the ontogenesis of global forest structure
PY  - 2020
AB  - A number of hypotheses and theories, such as the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, have been proposed to explain the natural maintenance of biodiversity in tropical and temperate forest ecosystems. However, to date the details of the processes behind this natural maintenance are still unclear. Recently two new nearest-neighbour characteristics were proposed and in this paper we demonstrate how they can contribute to a better understanding of the ontogenesis of global forest structure from localised neighbourhoods. We applied the new species and size segregation functions together with appropriate test procedures to four example woodland data sets from China at Daqingshan, Jiaohe, Jiulongshan and Xiaolongshan forest regions. In addition we quantified the morphology of the new characteristics and modelled a neighbourhood allometric coefficient linking the two functions. The results revealed quite different species segregation patterns with both conspecific and heterospecific attraction. We found these to be generally matched by equivalent size segregation patterns of attraction of similar and different sizes. It was straightforward to model the size segregation function from the knowledge of the species segregation function by estimating a neighbourhood allometric coefficient. The new characteristics have helped to quantify the extent and rate of decline of neighbourhood interactions in terms of spatial species and size diversity. Through the allometric neighbourhood coefficient the analysis highlighted once more how closely related species and size segregation are, thus supporting the mingling-size hypothesis. Using both a traditional and a restricted random-labelling test has provided a valuable tool for understanding the exact nature of species-mingling and size-inequality relationships.

TI  - The contribution of seed dispersers to tree species diversity in tropical rainforests.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Tropical rainforests are known for their extreme biodiversity, posing a challenging problem in tropical ecology. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the diversity of tree species, yet our understanding of this phenomenon remains incomplete. Here, we consider the contribution of animal seed dispersers to the species diversity of trees. We built a multi-layer lattice model of trees whose animal seed dispersers are allowed to move only in restricted areas to disperse the tree seeds. We incorporated the effects of seed dispersers in the traditional theory of allopatric speciation on a geological time scale. We modified the lattice model to explicitly examine the coexistence of new tree species and the resulting high biodiversity. The results indicate that both the coexistence and diversified evolution of tree species can be explained by the introduction of animal seed dispersers.

TI  - The fencing paradigm in woodland conservation: consequences for recruitment of a semi‐arid tree
PY  - 2012
AB  - Question

How does long-term fencing against large domestic herbivores affect regeneration of the dominant tree, Prosopis flexuosa, and hence the structure of semi-arid woodlands?



Location

Woodlands in the Central Monte Desert biome of Argentina, Nacunan Man and the Biosphere Reserve area (34° 20′ S, 67° 58′ W) and surrounding cattle-grazed ranches.



Methods

We compared seedling emergence and survival, the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings, and the population stage-based structure of P. flexuosa between paired sites inside and outside the Reserve of Nacunan (Argentina), which has been fenced to exclude domestic cattle for ca. 40 yr.



Results

Reserve sites had lower tree recruitment and seedling emergence, in spite of having greater seed production and seedling survival. Outside the reserve, survival was higher for seedlings in high-density clumps than for isolated seedlings. Seedling clumps occurred mostly near adult individuals, where cattle dung was abundant, suggesting an effect of cattle on seed dispersal. The balance between the effects of cattle exclusion on seedling emergence and on seedling survival was reflected in the stage structure of P. flexuosa woodlands, as populations at fenced sites were dominated by adult individuals, whereas those at cattle-grazed areas presented greater proportions of seedlings and saplings.



Conclusion

Fencing is a common practice used worldwide to exclude conservation areas from human disturbance. For example, it is assumed that disturbed woodlands may recover after fencing, thanks to increased tree recruitment after the exclusion of large herbivores. However, the actual effectiveness of fencing as a tool for forest conservation in overgrazed environments could be controversial because sequential effects of herbivores during the tree regeneration cycle may hamper predictions of the overall balance of the recruitment process. Our results suggest that dispersal by cattle influences the regeneration of P. flexuosa woodlands, and that the positive effects of cattle on seedling emergence compensate for the negative effects on seed production and seedling and sapling survival. Future management of P. flexuosa woodlands in the Central Monte Desert should consider that tree recruitment is closely related to land use, and that cattle exclusion does not necessarily guarantee woodland recovery in the long term.

TI  - The effect of soil-borne pathogens depends on the abundance of host tree species
PY  - 2015
AB  - The overarching issue for understanding biodiversity maintenance is how fitness advantages accrue to a species as it becomes rare, as this is the defining feature of stable coexistence mechanisms. Without these fitness advantages, average fitness differences between species will lead to exclusion. However, empirical evidence is lacking, especially for forests, due to the difficulty of manipulating density on a large-enough scale. Here we took advantage of naturally occurring contrasts in abundance between sites of a subtropical tree species, Ormosia glaberrima, to demonstrate how low-density fitness advantages accrue by the Janzen-Connell mechanism. The results showed that soil pathogens suppressed seedling recruitment of O. glaberrima when it is abundant but had little effect on the seedlings when it is at low density due to the lack of pathogens. The difference in seedling survival between abundant and low-density sites demonstrates strong dependence of pathogenic effect on the abundance of host species.

TI  - Nonrandom, diversifying processes are disproportionately strong in the smallest size classes of a tropical forest.
PY  - 2014
AB  - A variety of ecological processes influence diversity and species composition in natural communities. Most of these processes, whether abiotic or biotic, differentially filter individuals from birth to death, thereby altering species’ relative abundances. Nonrandom outcomes could accrue throughout ontogeny, or the processes that generate them could be particularly influential at certain stages. One long-standing paradigm in tropical forest ecology holds that patterns of relative abundance among mature trees are largely set by processes operating at the earliest life cycle stages. Several studies confirm filtering processes at some stages, but the longevity of large trees makes a rigorous comparison across size classes impossible without long-term demographic data. Here, we use one of the world’s longest-running, plot-based forest dynamics projects to compare nonrandom outcomes across stage classes. We considered a cohort of 7,977 individuals in 186 species that were alive in 1971 and monitored in 13 mortality censuses over 42 y to 2013. Nonrandom mortality with respect to species identity occurred more often in the smaller rather than the larger size classes. Furthermore, observed nonrandom mortality in the smaller size classes had a diversifying influence; species richness of the survivors was up to 30% greater than expected in the two smallest size classes, but not greater than expected in the larger size classes. These results highlight the importance of early life cycle stages in tropical forest community dynamics. More generally, they add to an accumulating body of evidence for the importance of early-stage nonrandom outcomes to community structure in marine and terrestrial environments.

TI  - Does fine scale spatiotemporal variation in seed rain translate into plant population structure?
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>In mast‐seeding species, strong annual variation in seed production is assumed to drive seed fate and ultimately plant recruitment. However, the effects of temporal variation in seed crops on spatial patterns of seed rain and recruitment are poorly understood, in part because of limited data on fine‐scale spatial variation of seed deposition. To investigate how mast‐seeding affects spatial variation in seed rain, we analysed a 15‐year data set on seed rain and population dynamics in a montane old‐growth forest (2 plots with 81 seed traps per ha), dominated by European beech <jats:italic>Fagus sylvatica</jats:italic> and, to a lesser degree, Norway spruce <jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic> and European silver fir <jats:italic>Abies alba</jats:italic>. Using geostatistical methods and point process modelling, we modeled 1) the relationship between annual seed crop and spatial heterogeneity of seed rain, 2) the temporal stability of seed rain hotspots and 3) the spatial relation of seed rain and recruitment into the population. The results illustrate the interaction between temporal and spatial variation in seed production and its consequences for population dynamics of mast‐seeding trees. The signature of annual variation in seed rain fades with seedling mortality over time in all three focal species. For beech, the cumulative probability of seed arrival over the whole study period drives spatial seedling and sapling dispersion patterns – mediated by light competition with older trees; seedling density was most strongly reduced by sapling density, while saplings were most frequently found in areas of low adult density. Such decoupling of spatial processes across life history stages, combined with spatial heterogeneity may play a larger role in driving stand‐level spatial dynamics than previously assumed.</jats:p>

TI  - The Ecological and Genetic Consequences of Density-Dependent Regulation in Plants
PY  - 1980
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of population size regulation is of vital importance to both the pure and applied ecologist. Throughout the history of ecology one school of thought has maintained that populations of plants and animals are in some way regulated by "density-dependent factors"i.e. processes that either increase mortality or decrease fecundity as the density of the population increases (133). Thus there would be a densitydependent feedback that holds the population within certain limits. A second school of thought has maintained that "density-independent factors" (e.g. weather conditions or disturbance) are more important in determining population size. Whether populations are regulated by density-dependent or densityindependent factors has been the subject of intensive debate and controversy over the past twenty-five years, especially in the zoological literature (10,

TI  - Seedling resistance, tolerance and escape from herbivores: insights from co-dominant canopy tree species in a resource-poor African rain forest
PY  - 2014
AB  - * Although plants can reduce the impacts of herbivory in multiple ways, these defensive traits are often studied in isolation and an understanding of the resulting strategies is incomplete. * In the study reported here, empirical evidence was simultaneously evaluated for the three main sets of traits available to plants: (i) resistance through constitutive leaf traits, (ii) tolerance to defoliation and (iii) escape in space, for three caesalpiniaceous tree species Microberlinia bisulcata, Tetraberlinia bifoliolata and T. korupensis, which co-dominate groves within the lowland primary rain forest of Korup National Park (Cameroon). * Mesh cages were placed around individual wild seedlings to exclude insect herbivores at 41 paired canopy gap and understorey locations. After following seedling growth and survival for c. 2 years, caged and control treatments were removed, leaves harvested to determine nutrient and phenolic concentrations, leaf mass per area estimated, and seedling performance in gaps followed for a further c. 2 years to quantify tolerance to the leaf harvesting. * The more nutrient-rich leaves of the weakly shade-tolerant M. bisulcata were damaged much more in gaps than the two strongly shade-tolerant Tetraberlinia species, which had higher leaf mass per area and concentrations of total phenols. Conversely, the faster-growing M. bisulcata was better able to tolerate defoliation in terms of height growth (reflushing capacity), but not at maintaining overall leaf numbers, than the other two species. * Across gaps, insect-mediated Janzen–Connell effects were most pronounced for M. bisulcata, less so for T. korupensis, and not detectable for T. bifoliolata. The three species differed distinctly in their secondary metabolic profiles. * Taken together, the results suggested a conceptual framework linking the three sets of traits, one in which the three co-dominant species adopt different strategies towards herbivore pressure depending on their different responses to light availability. This study is one of the first in a natural forest ecosystem to examine resistance to, tolerance of, and escape from herbivory among a group of co-occurring tropical tree species.

TI  - The advantage of the extremes: tree seedlings at intermediate abundance in a tropical forest have the highest richness of above-ground enemies and suffer the most damage
PY  - 2015
AB  - 1. Tropical forest tree diversity has been hypothesized to be maintained via the attraction of density
responsive and species-specific enemies. Tests of this hypothesis usually assume a linear relationship
between enemy pressure (amount of damage and enemy richness) and seedling or tree density. However,
enemy pressure is likely to change nonlinearly with local seedling abundance and community
scale tree abundance if enemies are characterized by nonlinear functional responses.
2. We examined the abiotic and biotic factors associated with richness of above-ground enemies
and foliar damage found in tree seedlings in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Rather than identify
specific enemies targeting these seedlings, we used damage morphotypes, a paleo-ecological method,
to derive a proxy for enemy species richness.
3. We found that the relationships between local and (conspecific seedling density) community scale
(conspecific basal area of adult trees) abundance and both richness of above-ground enemies and
foliar damage were hump-shaped. Seedlings of tree species existing at intermediate levels of abundance,
at both local and community scales, suffered more damage and experienced pressure from a
greater diversity of enemies than those existing at high or low densities.
4. We hypothesized that greater damage at intermediate abundance level could arise from a rich
mixture of generalist and specialist enemies targeting seedlings of intermediate abundance tree species.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that generalist enemies were more diverse on species
at rare or intermediate abundance relative to common tree species. However, specialist enemies
showed no significant trend across tree species abundance at either the local or community scales.
5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in tree species abundance leads to differences
in the magnitude and type of damage tropical tree seedlings suffer. This variation leads to a
nonlinear, hump-shaped relationship between species abundance and enemy damage, highlighting
fruitful directions for further development of species coexistence theory.

TI  - Why Do Some Tropical Forests Have So Many Species of Trees?
PY  - 2004
AB  - <jats:sec><jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Understanding why there are so many kinds of tropical trees requires learning, not only how tree species coexist, but what factors drive tree speciation and what governs a tree clade's diversification rate. Many report that hybrid sterility evolves very slowly between separated tree populations. If so, tree species rarely originate by splitting of large populations. Instead, they begin with few trees. The few studies available suggest that reproductive isolation between plant populations usually results from selection driven by lowered fitness of hybrids: speciation is usually a response to a “niche opportunity.” Using Hubbell's neutral theory of forest dynamics as a null hypothesis, we show that if new tree species begin as small populations, species that are now common must have spread more quickly than chance allows. Therefore, most tree species have some setting in which they can increase when rare. Trees face trade‐offs in suitability for different microhabitats, different‐sized clearings, different soils and climates, and resistance to different pests. These trade‐offs underlie the mechanisms maintaining α‐diversity and species turnover. Disturbance and microhabitat specialization appear insufficient to maintain α‐diversity of tropical trees, although they may maintain tree diversity north of Mexico or in northern Europe. Many studies show that where trees grow readily, tree diversity is higher and temperature and rainfall are less seasonal. The few data available suggest that pest pressure is higher, maintaining higher tree diversity, where winter is absent. Tree a‐diversity is also higher in regions with more tree species, which tend to be larger, free for a longer time from major shifts of climate, or in the tropics, where there are more opportunities for local coexistence.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESUMEN</jats:title><jats:p>Comprender por qué hay tantos tipos de árboles tropicales, se requiere aprender no sólo cómo las especies de árboles coexisten, sino también, cuáles factores conducen a su especiación, y qué determina la velocidad de diversificación de un clado de árboles. Muchos reportan que la esterilidad hibrida evoluciona muy lentamente entre poblaciones separadas de árboles. De ser asi, las especies de árboles raramente se originarian por la separación de grandes poblaciones; más bien empezarian con pocos árboles. Los pocos estudios disponibles sugieren que el aislamiento reproductivo entre las poblaciones vegetales usualmente resulta de selección derivada del bajo éxito de los hibridos: la especiación general‐mente responde a una “oportunidad de nicho”. Usando la teoria neutral de Hubbell de dinámica de bosques como hipótesis nula, nosotros mostramos que si las nuevas especies de árboles comienzan como poblaciones pequeñas, especies que ahora son communes deberian haberse expandido más rápido que lo que el azar permite. Por lo tanto, la mayoria de las especies de árboles tendrian alguna condición donde sus poblaciones podrian crecer cunando son raras. Los árboles enfrentan compromises en su adecuación por diferentes microhábitats, claros de differentes tamanos, diferentes suelos y climas, y resistencia a differentes plagas. Esros compromises sirven de base para los mecanismos que mantienen la diversidad α y al reemplazo especial de especies. Los distrubios y la especialización de microhabitats parecen ser insuficiente para mantener la diversidad α de árboles tropicales, sin embargo elloss pueden mantener diversidad de árboles al norte de México o en Europa del norte. Muchos estudios muestran que en lugares donde los árboles cresen fácilmente, la diversidad de árboles es mayor donde la temperatura y la lluvia son menos estacionales. Los pocos estudios disponibles sugieren que la presión de las plagas es mayor, manteniendo asl la diversidad de árboles en lugares donde no hay invierno. La diversidad α de árboles también es más alta en regions con más especies de árboles, las culaes tienden a ser más largas, exentas por un largo periodo de tiempo de grandes cambios climáticos, oen los trópicos donde hay más oportunidades de coexistir localmente.</jats:p></jats:sec>

TI  - Site Soil-Fertility and Light Availability Influence Plant-Soil Feedback
PY  - 2019
AB  - Negative plant-soil feedback (PSF) , where plant performance is reduced in soils conditioned by conspecifics, are widely documented in plant communities. However, the strength and sometimes direction of PSF can vary widely, presumably due to environmental context. We hypothesized that soil fertility and light availability influence the direction and strength of plant-soil feedback experienced by tree seedlings. We conducted a 10-week greenhouse experiment and assessed survivorship of black cherry (Prunus serotina) in low (~1% full sun) vs. high (~18% full sun) light availability and in non-sterile vs. sterile soils collected under the canopy of conspecific vs. heterospecific adult trees at five sites that vary in nutrient availability in Manistee National Forest, Michigan, USA. Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) also was included in the experiment, but no seedlings died and thus there are no survivorship responses to report. Prunus serotina seedlings experienced microbe-mediated negative plant-soil feedback in low fertility sites (higher C:N ratios and lower NH4+) but positive feedback at high fertility sites, but these feedbacks occurred only under high light availability. Consistent with these results, microbe-mediated negative PSF increased with soil Fe3+ and C:N ratios and decreased with NH4+. Thus lower fertility soils, characterized by high C:N and Fe3+availability and low NH4+, are associated with stronger negative conspecific feedback for P. serotina seedlings. Conversely, higher fertility soils flip the feedback to positive. Our results demonstrate the important role of environmental context, specifically light and soil nutrient availability, on the magnitude and direction of conspecific plant soil feedback. Thus, PSF is likely an important driver in plant community dynamics that may be either destabilizing (promote species coexistence) or stabilizing (promote monodominance) depending upon environmental context.

TI  - Distinct biogeography of different fungal guilds and their associations with plant species richness in forest ecosystems
PY  - 2019
AB  - Author(s): Wang, P; Chen, Y; Sun, Y; Tan, S; Zhang, S; Wang, Z; Zhou, J; Zhang, G; Shu, W; Luo, C; Kuang, J | Abstract: Plant pathogens are increasingly considered as important agents in promoting plant coexistence, while plant symbionts like ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) can facilitate plant dominance by helping conspecific individuals to defend against plant pathogens. However, we know little about their relationships with plants at large scales. Here, using soil fungal data collected from 28 forest reserves across China, we explored the latitudinal diversity gradients of overall fungi and different fungal functional guilds, including putative plant pathogens, EMF, and saprotrophic fungi. We further linked the spatial patterns of alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF to the variation of plant species richness. We found that the relationships between latitude and alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were region-dependent with sharp diversity shifts around the mid-latitude (~35°N), which differed from the unimodal diversity distributions of the overall and saprotrophic fungi. The variations in the diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were largely explained by the spatial regions (south vs. north/subtropical zone vs. temperate zone). Additionally, the alpha diversities of these two fungal guilds exhibited opposing trends across latitude. EMF could alter the relationship between diversities of putative plant pathogens and plants in the south/subtropical region, but not vice versa. We also found that the ratio of their alpha diversities (EMF to putative plant pathogens) was negatively related to plant species richness across the spatial regions (north to south), and explained ~10% of the variation of plant species richness. Overall, our findings suggest that plant-microbe interactions not only shape the local plant diversity but also may have non-negligible contributions to the large-scale patterns of plant diversity in forest ecosystems.

TI  - Spatial analysis of phylogenetic community structure: New version of a classical method
PY  - 2017
AB  - The increasing availability of phylogenetic information facilitates the use of evolutionary methods in community ecology to reveal the importance of evolution in the species assembly process. However, while several methods have been applied to a wide range of communities across different spatial scales with the purpose of detecting non-random phylogenetic patterns, the spatial aspects of phylogenetic community structure have received far less attention. Accordingly, the question for this study is: can point pattern analysis be used for revealing the phylogenetic structure of multi-species assemblages? We introduce a new individual-centered procedure for analyzing the scale-dependent phylogenetic structure of multi-species point patterns based on digitized field data. The method uses nested circular plots with increasing radii drawn around each individual plant and calculates the mean phylogenetic distance between the focal individual and all individuals located in the circular ring delimited by two successive radii. This scale-dependent value is then averaged over all individuals of the same species and the observed mean is compared to a null expectation with permutation procedures. The method detects particular radius values at which the point pattern of a single species exhibits maximum deviation from the expectation towards either phylogenetic aggregation or segregation. Its performance is illustrated using data from a grassland community in Hungary and simulated point patterns. The proposed method can be extended to virtually any distance function for species pairs, such as functional distances.

TI  - Neighborhood effects explain increasing asynchronous seedling survival in a subtropical forest
PY  - 2019
AB  - Biotic interactions play a critical role in mediating community responses to temporal environmental variation, but the importance of these effects relative to the direct effects of environmental change remains poorly understood, particularly in diverse forest communities. Here we combine a neighborhood modeling approach with insights from coexistence theory to assess the effects of temporal variation in species interactions and environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and understory light availability) on seedling survival over nine census years in a subtropical forest. We find significant temporal shifts in the magnitude of neighborhood effects on both community-wide and species-level seedling survival (statistically significant random effects of neighborhood × year and neighborhood × species × year interactions). These results are consistent with the idea that environmental change will play a fundamental role on forest regeneration dynamics by altering biotic interactions at the neighborhood scale. Moreover, differences among species in response to neighbors over time contribute to a pattern of temporal decoupling of seedling survival between species, which can help to promote diversity in certain contexts. In separate analyses of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), altered interactions with neighbors are much stronger predictors of asynchronous seedling survival among species than the pure effects of climate and plant functional traits, explaining twice as much variation (43.9% vs. 22.2%). In sum, these results reveal that divergent species responses to interannual environmental variability detected are driven primarily by indirect effects mediated by changing biotic environments. This highlights the importance of including indirect effects from local biotic (neighborhood) interactions in forecasts of forest community responses to global change.

TI  - Biotic pressures and environmental heterogeneity shape beta‐diversity of seedling communities in tropical montane forests
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Many theories have been proposed to explain the high diversity of plants in the tropics. However, we lack an understanding of the processes that drive plant diversity and community assembly at different spatial scales. Here, we applied beta‐diversity partitioning to test how biotic and abiotic factors are associated with seedling beta‐diversity in a tropical montane forest in southern Ecuador. We recorded seedling communities on 81 subplots in nine plots located at three elevations along a 2000 m elevational gradient. We measured biotic pressures (i.e. herbivory and fungal pathogen attacks) and environmental conditions (i.e. soil moisture and canopy closure) in all subplots and related them to species turnover and richness differences in seedling communities within and between elevations. We found that species turnover increased with differences in biotic dissimilarity within elevations, while differences in species richness within elevations increased with increasing environmental dissimilarity. Between elevations, species turnover increased with increasing environmental dissimilarity. Our findings show that species turnover and changes in species richness are related differently to abiotic and biotic factors, and that the importance of these factors for shaping seedling diversity is scale‐dependent. Our study contributes to better understand the processes driving seedling beta‐diversity and the assembly of plant communities in highly diverse tropical montane forests.</jats:p>

TI  - Distance-dependent seedling mortality and long-term spacing dynamics in a neotropical forest community.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Negative distance dependence (NDisD), or reduced recruitment near adult conspecifics, is thought to explain the astounding diversity of tropical forests. While many studies show greater mortality at near vs. far distances from adults, these studies do not seek to track changes in the peak seedling curve over time, thus limiting our ability to link NDisD to coexistence. Using census data collected over 12 years from central Panama in conjunction with spatial mark-connection functions, we show evidence for NDisD for many species, and find that the peak seedling curve shifts away from conspecific adults over time. We find wide variation in the strength of NDisD, which was correlated with seed size and canopy position, but other life-history traits showed no relationship with variation in NDisD mortality. Our results document shifts in peak seedling densities over time, thus providing evidence for the hypothesized spacing mechanism necessary for diversity maintenance in tropical forests.

TI  - Cultivated walnut trees showed earlier but not final advantage over its wild relatives in competing for seed dispersers
PY  - 2017
AB  - Little is known about seeding regeneration of cultivated trees compared to wild relatives in areas where seed dispersers are shared. Here, we investigated the differences in seed fates of cultivated walnut (Juglans regia) and wild Manchurian walnut (Juglans mandshurica) trees under rodent predation and dispersal. J. regia seeds have higher nutritional value (large size, mass and kernel mass) and lower mechanical defensiveness (thin endocarp) than J. mandshurica seeds. We tracked seeds of J. regia and J. mandshurica under both enclosure and field conditions to assess differences in competing for seed dispersers of the two co-occurring tree species of the same genus. We found that rodents preferred to harvest, eat and scatter-hoard seeds of J. regia as compared to those of J. mandshurica. Seeds of J. regia were removed and scatter-hoarded faster than those of J. mandshurica. Caches of J. regia were more likely to be rediscovered by rodents than those of J. mandshurica. These results suggest that J. regia showed earlier dispersal fitness but not the ultimate dispersal fitness over J. mandshurica in seeding regeneration under rodent mediation, implying that J. regia has little effect on seeding regeneration of J. mandshurica in the field. The effects of seed traits on seed dispersal fitness may vary at different dispersal stages under animal mediation.

TI  - The Temporal Dimension of Plant-Soil Microbe Interactions: Mechanisms Promoting Feedback between Generations.
PY  - 2021
AB  - AbstractSoil microbes can influence plant competitive outcomes by stabilizing plant community dynamics or mediating plant competitive hierarchies. Which effect dominates depends on whether microbial effects can extend beyond the focal conditioning individual. While it is well known that microbial effects can extend to other individuals through space, we lack an explicit theoretical understanding of the factors that regulate their spread to other individuals in subsequent generations. Here, we examine how the commonly assumed stabilizing effects of host-specific pathogens in fact depend on two factors that allow microbial effects to be cross-generational-which plant demographic vital rate is influenced by microbes and the conditioning and decay rates of soil microbial communities. With a novel patch occupancy model that incorporates the transition of soil states following plant colonization and mortality, we show that host-specific pathogens enable plant coexistence when they suppress conspecific plant colonization of empty patches but contribute to competitive hierarchies when they modify only the mortality and fecundity of the conditioning plant individual. In a series of model extensions, we further demonstrate that these latter microbial effects can still promote coexistence, but only when microbial communities decay slowly following plant death, thereby allowing microbial effects to be cross-generational. Our study calls for further empirical work quantifying the demographic rates most affected by soil microbes as well as the timescales of conditioning and decay.

TI  - The Evolutionary Ecology of Plant Chemical Defenses: From Molecules to Communities
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p> Classic theory relates herbivore pressure to the ecology and evolution of plant defenses. Here, we summarize current trends in the study of plant–herbivore interactions and how they shape the evolution of plant chemical defenses, host choice, and community composition and diversity. Inter- and intraspecific variation in defense investment is driven by resource availability. The evolution of defenses at deeper nodes of plant phylogeny is conserved, yet defenses are highly labile at the tips. On an ecological timescale, while greater specialization of tropical herbivores enhances local diversity by reducing the performance of plants with similar defenses, in temperate ecosystems with more generalist herbivores, rare defense profiles are at a disadvantage. On an evolutionary timescale, host choice by herbivores is largely determined by plant defenses rather than host phylogeny, leading to evolutionary tracking by herbivores rather than cocladogenesis. The interplay between plants and herbivores shapes both the origin and maintenance of diversity. </jats:p>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We analysed two fully mapped mixed Pine–Oak forest communities using spatial point pattern analysis to determine (a) the detailed structure of the intraspecific spatial patterns of saplings and adults, (b) the intra‐ and interspecific spatial interaction of saplings, adults and saplings relative to adults, (c) the spatial patterns of species richness at the community level and (d) whether seed dispersal mechanisms affect the plant–plant interaction networks and the ratio of adult to sapling neighbourhood densities used as surrogate for spatial self‐thinning.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The intraspecific spatial patterns of saplings and adults showed in general complex nested cluster structures that were similar for sapling and adult stages, despite substantial self‐thinning in some dry‐fruited species. The spatial network of saplings was characterized by positive spatial interactions. Adults of several tree species facilitated saplings in their proximity; however, adults of dry‐fruited species, but not those of fleshy‐fruited ones, lost almost all positive interactions that occurred at the sapling stage. Besides, interaction strength between adults was positive and often significantly stronger if both species were fleshy‐fruited. At the community level, the forests were structured into multispecies clumps across all life stages.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our analyses highlight the importance of the spatial legacy of seed dispersal and early recruitment in the assembly of plant communities.

Our analysis suggests that changes of the spatial structure across plant life stages are driven by seed dispersal mechanisms and subsequent spatial self‐thinning, generating a spatial footprint at the sapling stage that conditions the long‐term interactions between adult plants. Combining spatial point pattern analysis with network analysis and species traits is a promising way to disentangle the processes underlying observed patterns of local diversity.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Recruitment Pattern of Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae), a Rodent-dispersed Tree Species in French Guiana1
PY  - 1994
AB  - The recruitment pattern of Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) and the relationship between growth and survival of recruits were analyzed from 1984 to 1991 on two 2500 m2 plots, one with and one without free soil drainage. Most seeds and seedlings below two adult trees in the plots died within 6 to 8 months of establishment. Virtually all seedlings still alive several months after fruiting arose from seeds that were buried by scatterhoarding rodents. Because rodents do not disperse seeds a great distance and Vouacapoua seedlings survive well in the shaded understory, offspring recruitment was more dense near adults than further away. A significantly lower proportion of newly established seedlings died on freely drained soil than where drainage was blocked; mortality was due to "dampingoff' from fungal attack. First-year survival of seedlings from scatterhoarded seeds and growth rates for understory seedlings from 1984 to 1986 were higher on freely drained soil than on blocked soil. Long-term offspring survival was similar on both plots, while height increment was significantly greater on the freely drained plots than on the poorly drained soil. There was a significant negative relationship between the initial seedling density and proportion of survival on both plots within 6-8 months of establishment. However, there was no evidence of long-term compensatory mortality; the greater the initial density, the greater the final density of recruits surviving through years. The Vouacapoua recruitment pattern appears typical of a partially repelled syndrome with recruits growing both near adults and further away. High Vouacapoua tree density on soil with good drainage, as reported in the literature, is likely to result from better environmental conditions for early seedling survival and long-term growth of recruits.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We surveyed 10,756 seedlings from 272 tree species for disease symptoms along a mean annual precipitation gradient in the tropical wet forests of Central Panama for 3 months in the early wet season (June–August) and 2 months in the following dry season (March–April). Over 99% of observed disease symptoms were caused by necrotrophic foliar pathogens, while less than 1% of symptoms were attributed to soilborne pathogens.

TI  - Disentangling the role of oomycete soil pathogens as drivers of plant–soil feedbacks
PY  - 2021
AB  - Interactions among plant species and their soil biota drive plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) that play a major role in the dynamics and diversity of plant communities. Among the different components of the soil community, pathogens are considered to be the main drivers of negative PSFs. Despite this, the number of studies that have experimentally quantified the contribution of soil pathogens to PSFs remains considerably low. Here we conducted a greenhouse experiment with oomycete-specific fungicide to quantify the contribution of soil pathogens, and particularly oomycete pathogens, to individual and pairwise PSFs in forest communities. We used as a case study Mediterranean mixed forests dominated by Quercus suber and invaded by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. The fungicide treatment was crossed with a competition treatment to explore how conspecific neighbors might modify pathogen effects. To place the results of the experiment in a wider context, we also conducted a systematic review of published papers that explicitly used fungicide to explore the role of pathogens in PSF experiments. Our experimental results showed that oomycete pathogens were the main drivers of individual PSFs in the study forests. Oomycete effects varied among tree species according to their susceptibility to P. cinnamomi, driving negative PSFs in the highly susceptible Q. suber but not in the coexistent Olea europaea. Oomycete-driven PSFs were not modified by intraspecific competition. Oomycete pathogens were also major contributors to negative pairwise PSFs assumed to promote species coexistence. Results from the systematic review supported the novelty of our experimental results, since only three studies had previously used oomycete-specific fungicide in a PSF context and none in systems invaded by exotic oomycetes. Overall, our results provide novel evidence of oomycete pathogens (including the exotic P. cinnamomi) as fundamental drivers of negative individual and pairwise PSFs with implications for species coexistence in invaded communities. Although in the short-term invasive pathogens might contribute to species coexistence by causing self-limitation in dominant species, strong inter-specific variation in self-limitation might undermine coexistence in the long-term. Because of the increasing number of exotic oomycetes worldwide, further attention should be given to oomycetes as drivers of PSFs in plant communities.

In principle, populations of plant species can be regulated by distinct host-specific natural enemies that have weak or nonexistent effects on heterospecific competitors, preventing any single species from becoming dominant and thus promoting diversity. Two of the first steps in exploring the role of natural enemies in diversity regulation are to (1) identify potential enemies and (2) evaluate their levels of host specificity by determining if interactions between any one host and its enemy have equivalent survival impacts on co-occurring host species. We developed a bioinformatics framework to evaluate impacts of potential pathogens on seedling survival, for both single and multiple infections. Importantly, we consider scenarios not only if there are specialist pathogens for each plant, but also when generalist pathogens have differential effects on multiple host species, and when co-infection has species-specific effects. We then applied this analytical framework to a field experiment using molecular techniques to detect potential fungal pathogens on co-occurring tree seedling hosts. Combinatorial complexity created by 160 plant-fungus interactions was reduced to eight combinations that affect seedling survival. Potential fungal pathogens had broad host ranges, but seedling species were each regulated by different combinations of fungi or by generalist fungi that had differential effects on multiple plant species. Soil moisture can have the potential to shift the nature of the interactions in some plant-fungal combinations from neutral to detrimental. Reassessing the assumption of single-enemy-single-host interactions broadens the mechanisms through which natural enemies can influence plant diversity.

TI  - Higher-order interactions mitigate direct negative effects on population dynamics of herbaceous plants during succession
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Plant succession is regulated by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. However, previous studies of biotic drivers have focused overwhelmingly on direct pairwise species interactions, ignoring the likely prevalent higher-order interactions (HOIs) in natural systems. Climate also plays a significant role in determining successional dynamics with both direct effects and indirect effects via altered biotic interactions. Here we explored the relative effects of direct species interactions, HOIs, climate, and their interactions on population dynamics of herbaceous plants during 50 years of post-agricultural secondary succession and tested whether the inclusion of HOIs and climate data improved forecasts of population dynamics. Direct intraspecific interactions were competitive and prevalent across the 90 herbaceous plants examined, while direct interspecific interactions only affected populations of 29% species. HOIs, mainly arose from intraspecific HOIs of conspecifics, were mostly positive and thus largely mitigated the competitive effects of direct intraspecific interactions. Species with lower peak cover experienced stronger intraspecific competition and positive intraspecific HOIs of conspecifics. Direct interspecific interactions had neutral or facilitative effects on species with lower peak cover, and tended to have competitive effects on species with higher peak cover. Climate simultaneously influenced population dynamics both directly and indirectly via altered species interactions. Forecast performance was significantly improved with the inclusion of HOIs or climate for about half and one-third of species, respectively. Our study emphasizes the importance of HOIs, which largely mitigated direct competitive effects on population dynamics of herbaceous plants during succession. Teasing apart HOIs from direct species interactions substantially refined our understanding of successional dynamics of herbaceous plants and improved the accuracy of forecasting population dynamics during succession in a changing world.</jats:p>

TI  - Intrinsic biotic factors and microsite conditions drive seedling survival in a species with masting reproduction.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Seedling recruitment following a masting event, where more fruits are produced in synchrony and intermittently compared with other species, plays a crucial role in determining species diversity and community structure. Such seedling recruitment can be superabundant, but followed by high mortality shortly thereafter. Differences in biotic factors such as seedling characteristics, competition, and herbivory, and microsite-specific abiotic factors could determine seedling fate in space and time.In a subtropical forest in south China, for 2 years using censuses conducted every 1-2 months, we monitored 40 seed traps and 120, 1 m2 quadrats in five 1-ha plots located from 1,400 to 1,850 m asl for the masting maple species, Acer campbellii subsp. sinense (Pax) P.C.DeJong. We measured biotic-conspecific and heterospecific seedling density, species richness, herbivory, seedling height, and leaf number-and abiotic-canopy openness, slope, and aspect-factors to assess drivers of seedling survival and evaluated A. campbellii subsp. sinense presence in the soil seed bank (SSB).The masting seed dispersal peak and seedling emergence peak occurred between October 2017 and January 2018, and May 2018, respectively. Of 688 selected seedlings, mortality was 92.7% within one year. No seeds were observed in the SSB. Seedling height and leaf number positively affected seedling survival, while seed placement as measured by aspect also showed effects on survival. Conspecific and heterospecific density and herbivory did not show any clear effect. Higher probabilities of seedling survival were found in areas with larger canopy openness (≥12% canopy gap size) and in steeper microsites (≥35°). Synthesis. Masting is mainly studied as a population-level phenomenon from the fruiting tree perspective. Our study of individual seedling fate revealed that intrinsic biotic factors and seed placement were key drivers of survival. Although biotic determinants such as competition from conspecifics or heterospecifics or herbivory did not determine survival, their ubiquitous presence may be an underlying equalizer in community dynamics where seedlings that overcome biotic pressures, if placed at the right microsite, are at better odds at being recruited to the next life history stages.

TI  - Habitat Quality Differentiation and Consequences for Ecosystem Service Provision of an Amazonian Hyperdominant Tree Species.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecosystem services of Amazonian forests are disproportionally produced by a limited set of hyperdominant tree species. Yet the spatial variation in the delivery of ecosystem services by individual hyperdominant species across their distribution ranges and corresponding environmental gradients is poorly understood. Here, we use the concept of habitat quality to unravel the effect of environmental gradients on seed production and aboveground biomass (AGB) of the Brazil nut, one of Amazonia's largest and most long-lived hyperdominants. We find that a range of climate and soil gradients create trade-offs between density and fitness of Brazil nut trees. Density responses to environmental gradients were in line with predictions under the Janzen-Connell and Herms-Mattson hypotheses, whereas tree fitness responses were in line with resource requirements of trees over their life cycle. These trade-offs resulted in divergent responses in area-based seed production and AGB. While seed production and AGB of individual trees (i.e., fitness) responded similarly to most environmental gradients, they showed opposite tendencies to tree density for almost half of the gradients. However, for gradients creating opposite fitness-density responses, area-based seed production was invariable, while trends in area-based AGB tended to mirror the response of tree density. We conclude that while the relation between environmental gradients and tree density is generally indicative of the response of AGB accumulation in a given area of forest, this is not necessarily the case for fruit production.

TI  - Local distribution patterns of fleshy‐fruited woody plants – testing the orchard hypothesis
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>Plant distribution patterns are influenced by many different factors. We examined mechanisms behind local distribution patterns of boreo‐nemoral fleshy‐fruited woody plants with seed dispersal mainly mediated by birds. It has been suggested that guilds of these plants develop ‘orchards', i.e. locally aggregated occurrences composed of several species. We analysed spatially explicit occurrence data of different life stages of a local guild of fleshy‐fruited woody plants in south‐eastern Sweden, and conducted a seedling recruitment experiment for a subset of ten species. Spatial point pattern analyses showed that the guild of fleshy‐fruited species was aggregated at small (&lt; 10 m) spatial scales. Saplings were more common under canopies of heterospecific reproductive individuals than expected by chance. These results show that the local guild of fleshy‐fruited species is distributed as orchards, i.e. clusters consisting of individuals of different species and life stages. We found no evidence of negative distance dependence between saplings and reproductive conspecific individuals. Results from the recruitment experiment suggest that recruitment is seed limited and generally low among the studied species. At the site‐scale (circular areas with 50 m radius), there was no difference in seedling recruitment between sites with and without reproductive conspecific individuals for most species included in the recruitment experiment. This further suggests that the aggregated patterns found are not simply a result of spatial concordance in suitable habitats across life stages. Instead, we suggest that the sheer number of seeds from species in the guild deposited under the crowns of fruit bearing individuals is the main mechanism behind the build‐up of orchards. Although further studies are needed to fully disentangle the processes underlying the observed patterns of local diversity, we argue that describing patterns and contrasting them to the predictions of ecologically relevant hypotheses is a useful first step.</jats:p>

TI  - The role of transcriptomes linked with responses to light environment on seedling mortality in a subtropical forest, China
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary
Differences in seedling survival in trees have a lasting imprint on seedling, juvenile and adult community structure. Identifying the drivers of these differences, therefore, is a critical research objective that ultimately requires knowledge regarding how organismal function interacts with the local environment to influence survival rates.
In tree communities, differences in light use strategies are frequently invoked to explain differences in seedling demographic performance through growth and survival trade-offs. For example, shade-tolerant species grow slowly and have higher survival rates, whereas shade-intolerant species grow quickly but have lower survival rates. Thus, functional traits related to photosynthesis should be strong predictors of demographic rates, but results in the literature are mixed indicating that additional or alternative information regarding organismal function should be considered.
Here, we provide a community-wide inventory of transcriptomes in a subtropical tree community. This information is utilized to determine the degree to which species share homologous genes related to gene ontologies for light use and harvesting. These species similarities are used in neighbourhood generalized linear mixed-effects models of seedling survival that evaluated seedling survival as a function of the transcriptomic, functional trait and phylogenetic composition of the local neighbourhood. The results show neighbourhood similarity in three of the 15 gene ontologies evaluated are significantly related to survival rates based on neighbourhood composition. For two of these ontologies, survival rates increase when neighbours are similar in their gene tree composition indicating the importance of abiotic filtering and performance hierarchies.
Synthesis. The present work takes a novel approach by sequencing the transcriptomes of naturally co-occurring tree species in a subtropical forest in China. The results show that the transcriptomic similarity of species is a significant predictor of differential survival. The study demonstrates that exploring the functional genomic similarity of non-model species in nature has the potential to increase the breadth and depth of our understanding of how gene function influences species co-occurrence and population dynamics in communities.

TI  - Effects of drought, disturbance, and biotic neighborhood on experimental tree seedling performance.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Forest biodiversity is likely maintained by a complex suite of interacting drivers that vary in importance across both space and time. Contributing factors include disturbance, interannual variation in abiotic variables, and biotic neighborhood effects. To probe ongoing uncertainties and potential interactions, we investigated tree seedling performance in a temperate mid-Atlantic forest ecosystem. We planted seedlings of five native tree species in mapped study plots, half of which were subjected to disturbance, and then monitored seedling survival, height growth, and foliar condition. The final year of data collection encompassed a drought, enabling comparison between intervals varying in water availability. Seedling performance was analyzed as a function of canopy cover and biotic neighborhood (conspecific and heterospecific abundance), including interactions, with separate generalized linear mixed models fit for each interval. All species exhibited: (a) pronounced declines in height growth during the drought year, (b) detrimental effects of adult conspecifics, and (c) beneficial effects of canopy openness. However, despite these consistencies, there was considerable variation across species in terms of the relevant predictors for each response variable in each interval. Our results suggest that drought may strengthen or reveal conspecific inhibition in some instances while weakening it or obscuring it in others, and that some forms of conspecific inhibition may manifest only under particular canopy conditions (although given the inconsistency of our findings, we are not convinced that conspecific inhibition is critical for diversity maintenance in our study system). Overall, our work reveals a complex forest ecosystem that appears simultaneously and interactively governed by biotic neighborhood structure (e.g., conspecific and/or heterospecific abundance), local habitat conditions (e.g., canopy cover), and interannual variability (e.g., drought).

TI  - Statistical mechanics of ecological systems: Neutral theory and beyond
PY  - 2016
AB  - The simplest theories often have much merit and many limitations, and, in this vein, the value of neutral theory (NT) of biodiversity has been the subject of much debate over the past 15 years. NT was proposed at the turn of the century by Stephen Hubbell to explain several patterns observed in the organization of ecosystems. Among ecologists, it had a polarizing effect: There were a few ecologists who were enthusiastic, and there were a larger number who firmly opposed it. Physicists and mathematicians, instead, welcomed the theory with excitement. Indeed, NT spawned several theoretical studies that attempted to explain empirical data and predicted trends of quantities that had not yet been studied. While there are a few reviews of NT oriented toward ecologists, the goal here is to review the quantitative aspects of NT and its extensions for physicists who are interested in learning what NT is, what its successes are, and what important problems remain unresolved. Furthermore, this review could also be of interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting results are buried in the vast NT literature. It is proposed to make these more accessible by extracting them and presenting them in a logical fashion. The focus of this review is broader than NT: new, more recent approaches for studying ecological systems and how one might introduce realistic non-neutral models are also discussed.

TI  - Neighbourhood composition determines growth, architecture and herbivory in tropical rain forest tree seedlings
PY  - 2006
AB  - Summary


1
Interspecific and intraspecific competition in seedling banks may be important determinants of regeneration success in some groups of canopy trees, e.g. dipterocarps in south-east Asian tropical rain forests, and the outcomes of these competitive interactions may contribute to the maintenance of the high levels of plant diversity.

2
We present the results of an experiment examining the effects of seedling bank diversity within canopy gaps on seedling growth, architecture and levels of insect herbivore defoliation over 18 months. Within each of six experimental canopy gaps, we planted two conspecific blocks of Shorea leprosula (Dipterocarpaceae) seedlings and two heterospecific blocks of S. leprosula seedlings amongst four other dipterocarp species with differing growth rates and palatability to herbivores.

3
The growth allocation patterns of S. leprosula differed according to whether they were planted among conspecifics or heterospecifics. Although S. leprosula seedlings grew taller in conspecific stands, their above ground biomass did not differ between planting treatments, due to increased branching and leaf area in seedlings in the heterospecific stands.

4
Shorea leprosula displayed the lowest levels of antiherbivore defences and sustained the greatest levels of defoliation of all species studied. Despite an increase of almost 60% in leaf damage in conspecific vs. heterospecific stands, neither biomass nor survival of S. leprosula seedlings differed between stands over the 18-month growth period.

5
The important effects of neighbourhood composition on the growth and herbivory of S. leprosula seedlings, suggest that diversity of seedling banks can be an important determinant of regeneration success and, thus, forest dynamics. Neighbourhood composition may have similar impacts on competitive outcomes and biomass allocation patterns in other ecological communities.

TI  - Recruitment limitation in three large‐seeded plant species in a tropical moist forest
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recruitment limitation—the failure of a species to establish recruits at an available site—is a potential determinant of plant communities’ structure, causing local communities to be a limited subset of the regional species pool. Recruitment limitation results from three mechanisms: (i) lack of seed sources (i.e., source limitation), (ii) failure of available seeds to reach recruitment sites (i.e., dispersal limitation), and (iii) failure of arrived seeds to establish at a location (i.e., establishment limitation). Here, we evaluated the relative importance of these mechanisms in three co‐occurring tree species (<jats:italic>Dipteryx oleifera</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Attalea butyracea</jats:italic>, and<jats:italic>Astrocaryum standleyanum</jats:italic>) that share seed dispersers/predators. The study was set up on Barro Colorado Island (Panama) at 62 one‐ha sites with varying tree densities. Source limitation was estimated as the proportion of sites that would be reached by seeds if seeds were distributed uniformly. Dispersal limitation was estimated from the number of sites with seeds in the soil bank. Establishment limitation was evaluated by measuring germination and 1‐year survival in seed addition experiments. The effect of conspecific and heterospecific densities on the mechanisms was evaluated at three spatial scales (1, 5, and 9 ha). For all species, seed predation was the most important recruitment component (~80% decrease in seed survival). Establishment varied among species and was affected by conspecific and heterospecific species densities across spatial scales. Given that species identity, distribution, and seed dispersal/predation affect recruitment at multiple scales, multiscale studies are required to understand how recruitment limitation determines community structure in tropical forests.</jats:p><jats:p>Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.</jats:p>

TI  - Resistance Genes Affect How Pathogens Maintain Plant Abundance and Diversity.
PY  - 2020
AB  - AbstractSpecialized pathogens are thought to maintain plant community diversity; however, most ecological studies treat pathogens as a black box. Here we develop a theoretical model to test how the impact of specialized pathogens changes when plant resistance genes (R-genes) mediate susceptibility. This work synthesizes two major hypotheses: the gene-for-gene model of pathogen resistance and the Janzen-Connell hypothesis of pathogen-mediated coexistence. We examine three scenarios. First, R-genes do not affect seedling survival; in this case, pathogens promote diversity. Second, seedlings are protected from pathogens when their R-gene alleles and susceptibility differ from those of nearby conspecific adults, thereby reducing transmission. If resistance is not costly, pathogens are less able to promote diversity because populations with low R-gene diversity suffer higher mortality, putting those populations at a disadvantage and potentially causing their exclusion. R-gene diversity may also be reduced during population bottlenecks, creating a priority effect. Third, when R-genes affect survival but resistance is costly, populations can avoid extinction by losing resistance alleles, as they cease paying a cost that is unneeded. Thus, the impact pathogens can have on tree diversity depends on the mechanism of plant-pathogen interactions. Future empirical studies should examine which of these scenarios most closely reflects the real world.

TI  - How latitude affects biotic interactions
PY  - 2017
AB  - Are biotic interactions, such as competition and predation, stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes? Biologists have long speculated that more intense interactions tend to occur at lower rather than at higher latitudes as a result of year-round warm and wet conditions near the equator, particularly in lowland tropical rainforests ( 1 ). This idea is now well established in the ecological literature ( 1 , 2 ), but recent debate has questioned whether such a latitudinal gradient in biotic interactions actually exists ( 3 ). On page 1389 of this issue, LaManna et al. provide evidence that the intensity of at least some types of biotic interactions are indeed stronger closer to the equator ( 4 ).

TI  - Warming intensifies soil pathogen negative feedback on a temperate tree.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The soil pathogen-induced Janzen-Connell (JC) effect is considered as a primary mechanism regulating plant biodiversity worldwide. As predicted by the framework of the classic plant disease triangle, severity of plant diseases is often influenced by temperature, yet insufficient understanding of how increasing temperatures affect the JC effect contributes uncertainty in predictions about how global warming affects biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr field warming experiment, combining open-top chambers with pesticide treatment, to test the effect of elevated temperatures on seedling mortality of a temperate tree species, Prunus padus, from a genus with known susceptibility to soil-borne pathogens. Elevated temperature significantly increased the mortality of P. padus seedlings in the immediate vicinity of parent trees, concurrent with increased relative abundance of pathogenic fungi identified to be virulent to Prunus species. Our study offers experimental evidence suggesting that global warming significantly intensifies the JC effect on a temperate tree species due to increased relative abundance of pathogenic fungi. This work advances our understanding about changes in the JC effect linked to ongoing global warming, which has important implications for predicting tree diversity in a warmer future.

TI  - Herbivores limit the population size of big‐leaf mahogany trees in an Amazonian forest
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Janzen–Connell hypothesis proposes that specialized herbivores maintain high numbers of tree species in tropical forests by restricting adult recruitment so that host populations remain at low densities. We tested this prediction for the large timber tree species, Swietenia macrophylla, whose seeds and seedlings are preyed upon by small mammals and a host-specific moth caterpillar Steniscadia poliophaea, respectively. At a primary forest site, experimental seed additions to gaps – canopy-disturbed areas that enhance seedling growth into saplings – over three years revealed lower survival and seedling recruitment closer to conspecific trees and in higher basal area neighborhoods, as well as reduced subsequent seedling survival and height growth. When we included these Janzen–Connell effects in a spatially explicit individual-based population model, the caterpillar's impact was critical to limiting Swietenia's adult tree density, with a > 10-fold reduction estimated at 300 years. Our research demonstrates the crucial but oft-ignored linkage between Janzen–Connell effects on offspring and population-level consequences for a long-lived, potentially dominant tree species.

TI  - Before the ‘Big Chill’: Patterns of plant-insect associations from the Neogene of Iceland
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract Iceland is the only known terrestrial place in the subarctic North Atlantic providing a fairly continuous sedimentary and plant fossil record over the past 15 million years. While the basic palaeobotanical framework of this pattern has been well established during the last decade, less attention has been paid to the abundant insect traces on fossil leaves/leaflets. Here, we assess the diversity and frequency of insect herbivory on 4349 fossil angiosperm leaves/leaflets from six plant-bearing sedimentary formations exposed at 18 localities. By combining analyses of environmental factors, species interactions, ecology, biogeography, and the geological history, our results demonstrate how patterns of herbivory have changed over time in relation to temperature fluctuations that profoundly influenced levels of insect-mediated damage diversity and frequency. In addition, higher structural complexity, particularly the establishment of species-rich herb layer communities seems to have positively influenced the structure of insect communities in early late Miocene palaeoforests of Iceland.

TI  - Life histories of hosts and pathogens predict patterns in tropical fungal plant diseases
PY  - 2013
AB  - Plant pathogens affect the fitness of their hosts and maintain biodiversity. However, we lack theories to predict the type and intensity of infections in wild plants. Here we demonstrate using fungal pathogens of tropical plants that an examination of the life histories of hosts and pathogens can reveal general patterns in their interactions. Fungal infections were more commonly reported for light-demanding than for shade-tolerant species and for evergreen rather than for deciduous hosts. Both patterns are consistent with classical defence theory, which predicts lower resistance in fast-growing species and suggests that the deciduous habit can reduce enemy populations. In our literature survey, necrotrophs were found mainly to infect shade-tolerant woody species whereas biotrophs dominated in light-demanding herbaceous hosts. Far-red signalling and its inhibitory effects on jasmonic acid signalling are likely to explain this phenomenon. Multiple changes between the necrotrophic and the symptomless endophytic lifestyle at the ecological and evolutionary scale indicate that endophytes should be considered when trying to understand large-scale patterns in the fungal infections of plants. Combining knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of pathogen resistance with classical defence theory enables the formulation of testable predictions concerning general patterns in the infections of wild plants by fungal pathogens.

TI  - Generalist birds promote tropical forest regeneration and increase plant diversity via rare‐biased seed dispersal
PY  - 2016
AB  - Regenerated forests now compose over half of the world's tropical forest cover and are increasingly important as providers of ecosystem services, freshwater, and biodiversity conservation. Much of the value and functionality of regenerating forests depends on the plant diversity they contain. Tropical forest diversity is strongly shaped by mutualistic interactions between plants and fruit-eating animals (frugivores) that disperse seeds. Here we show how seed dispersal by birds can influence the speed and diversity of early successional forests in Puerto Rico. For two years, we monitored the monthly fruit production of bird-dispersed plants on a fragmented landscape, and measured seed dispersal activity of birds and plant establishment in experimental plots located in deforested areas. Two predominantly omnivorous bird species, the Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) and the Gray Kingbird (Tyrannus dominicensis), proved critical for speeding up the establishment of woody plants and increasing the species richness and diversity of the seed rain in deforested areas. Seed dispersal by these generalists increased the odds for rare plant species to disperse and establish in experimental forest-regeneration plots. Results indicate that birds that mix fruit and insects in their diets and actively forage across open and forested habitats can play keystone roles in the regeneration of mutualistic plant-animal communities. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that rare-biased (antiapostatic) frugivory and seed dispersal is the mechanism responsible for increasing plant diversity in the early-regenerating community.

TI  - Local-scale drivers of tree survival in a temperate forest.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Tree survival plays a central role in forest ecosystems. Although many factors such as tree size, abiotic and biotic neighborhoods have been proposed as being important in explaining patterns of tree survival, their contributions are still subject to debate. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the relative importance of tree size, local abiotic conditions and the density and identity of neighbors on tree survival in an old-growth temperate forest in northeastern China at three levels (community, guild and species). Tree size and both abiotic and biotic neighborhood variables influenced tree survival under current forest conditions, but their relative importance varied dramatically within and among the community, guild and species levels. Of the variables tested, tree size was typically the most important predictor of tree survival, followed by biotic and then abiotic variables. The effect of tree size on survival varied from strongly positive for small trees (1–20 cm dbh) and medium trees (20–40 cm dbh), to slightly negative for large trees (>40 cm dbh). Among the biotic factors, we found strong evidence for negative density and frequency dependence in this temperate forest, as indicated by negative effects of both total basal area of neighbors and the frequency of conspecific neighbors. Among the abiotic factors tested, soil nutrients tended to be more important in affecting tree survival than topographic variables. Abiotic factors generally influenced survival for species with relatively high abundance, for individuals in smaller size classes and for shade-tolerant species. Our study demonstrates that the relative importance of variables driving patterns of tree survival differs greatly among size classes, species guilds and abundance classes in temperate forest, which can further understanding of forest dynamics and offer important insights into forest management.

TI  - Foliar pathogens are unlikely to stabilize coexistence of competing species in a California grassland.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Pathogen infection is common in wild plants and animals, and may regulate their populations. If pathogens have narrow host ranges and increase with the density of their favored hosts, they may promote host species diversity by suppressing common species to the benefit of rare species. Yet, because many pathogens infect multiple co-occurring hosts, they may not strongly respond to the relative abundance of a single host species. Are natural communities dominated by specialized pathogens that respond to the relative abundance of a specific host or by pathogens with broad host ranges and limited responses to the relative abundance of single host? The answer determines the potential for pathogens to promote host coexistence, as often hypothesized, or to have negligible or even negative effects on host coexistence. We lack a systematic understanding of the impacts, identities, and host ranges of pathogens in natural communities. Here we characterize a community of foliar fungal pathogens and evaluate their host specificity and fitness impacts in a California grassland community of native and exotic species. We found that most of the commonly isolated fungal pathogens were multi-host, with intermediate to low specialization. The amount of pathogen damage each host experienced was independent of host species local relative abundance. Despite pathogen sharing among the host species, fungal communities slightly differed in composition across host species. Plants with high pathogen damage tended to have lower seed production but the relationship was weak, suggesting limited fitness impacts. Moreover, seed production was not dependent on the local relative abundance of each plant species, suggesting that stabilizing coexistence mechanisms may operate at larger spatial scales in this community. Because foliar pathogens in this grassland community are multi-host and have small fitness impacts, they are unlikely to promote negative frequency dependence or plant species coexistence in this system. Still, given that pathogen community composition differentiates across host species, some more subtle feedbacks between host relative abundance and pathogen community composition, damage, and fitness impacts are possible, which could, in turn, promote either coexistence or competitive exclusion.

TI  - Plant-soil feedbacks from 30-year family-specific soil cultures: phylogeny, soil chemistry and plant life stage.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Intraspecific negative feedback effects, where performance is reduced on soils conditioned by conspecifics, are widely documented in plant communities. However, interspecific feedbacks are less well studied, and their direction, strength, causes, and consequences are poorly understood. If more closely related species share pathogens, or have similar soil resource requirements, plants may perform better on soils conditioned by more distant phylogenetic relatives. There have been few empirical tests of this prediction across plant life stages, and none of which attempt to account for soil chemistry. Here, we test the utility of phylogeny for predicting soil feedback effects on plant survival and performance (germination, seedling survival, growth rate, biomass). We implement a full factorial experiment growing species representing five families on five plant family-specific soil sources. Our experiments exploit soils that have been cultured for over 30 years in plant family-specific beds at Oxford University Botanic Gardens. Plant responses to soil source were idiosyncratic, and species did not perform better on soils cultured by phylogenetically more distant relatives. The magnitude and sign of feedback effects could, however, be explained by differences in the chemical properties of “home” and “away” soils. Furthermore, the direction of soil chemistry-related plant-soil feedbacks was dependent on plant life stage, with the effects of soil chemistry on germination success and accumulation of biomass inversely related. Our results (1) suggest that the phylogenetic distance between plant families cannot predict plant–soil feedbacks across multiple life stages, and (2) highlight the need to consider changes in soil chemistry as an important driver of population responses. The contrasting responses at plant life stages suggest that studies focusing on brief phases in plant demography (e.g., germination success) may not give a full picture of plant–soil feedback effects.

TI  - Interspecific variation in seedling responses to seed limitation and habitat conditions for 14 Neotropical woody species
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary 1. We assessed the relative importance of dispersal and niche processes in structuring plant populations at the seedling stage for 14 woody plant species (12 trees and 2 lianas) in an old-growth tropical forest of French Guiana. 2. We combined long-term data from a network of 160 stations, each comprising a seed trap and two to three neighbouring seedling plots, with fine-scale quantification of environmental variables. 3. For each species, we quantified seed limitation as the proportion of seed traps that were not reached by seeds, and establishment limitation as the proportion of stations where seeds arrived but where seedlings did not occur. All species showed strong seed limitation, whereas only one species showed significant establishment limitation. 4. We determined the proportion of variance in local seedling density explained by either seed density or environmental factors, and we assessed the effect of environment on seedling survival. 5. Although seeds showed considerable spatial clumping in all species, seed density explained a significant fraction of the variance in seedling density for only five species. Habitat preferences explained a significant fraction of the variance in seedling density for six species. Of the remaining species, four showed no significant relationship with either seed arrival or habitat conditions. 6. Environmental effects on local seedling abundance were weakly related to those on seedling survival. When seedling density was significantly correlated with a given environmental factor, survival was usually not correlated with that factor. Habitat association patterns might change over time, as environmental filtering operates. 7. Synthesis . Our results show that both seed arrival and habitat preferences contribute to explaining the abundance of tropical woody species at the seedling stage, but their relative importance showed important interspecific differences. Although our study was limited to a subset of woody species, they accounted for 27% of the individuals composing the seedling layer. Thus, our findings are likely to have important consequences in the structuring of the seedling community.

TI  - Distance-dependent effects of pathogenic fungi on seedlings of a legume tree: impaired nodule formation and identification of antagonistic rhizosphere bacteria
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary
The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis proposes that diversity of tree communities is promoted by species-specific enemies that suppress seedling recruitment. Pathogenic soil-borne fungi are often responsible for JC effects. However, previous ecological studies have not placed JC effects in the context of beneficial soil bacteria. Using the JC effect surrounding a subtropical legume tree (Ormosia glaberrima) as a model, we characterized tripartite interactions between seedlings, soil fungi and plant-associated bacteria.
Survival of seedlings grown in soil inocula collected at close distances to focal adult trees was reduced. Half of the experimental units were treated with fungicides to confirm the presence of pathogenic fungi. In a parallel experiment, nitrogen-fixing rhizobia induced fewer nodules on O. glaberrima seedlings when soil inocula were collected closer to focal adult trees. An inoculation experiment with rhizobial isolates promoted nodulation of seedlings grown in soil taken at close distances to adult trees, suggesting that rhizobial densities are suboptimal at these locations.
Fusarium oxysporum, a pathogen of O. glaberrima seedlings, produced exudates that inhibited growth of most bacteria isolated from nodules. Accordingly, F. oxysporum negatively affected rhizosphere colonization of rhizobia in a co-inoculation experiment. Contrariwise, certain Burkholderia isolates (from nodules and the rhizosphere) were identified that possess the ability to inhibit growth of F. oxysporum. The majority of the antagonistic bacteria were isolated from locations with fungal pathogens, suggesting competition between fungi and rhizosphere bacteria.
Exclusion of pathogenic fungi by application of fungicides promoted nodulation of O. glaberrima seedlings under growth-room and field conditions.
Synthesis. Our findings indicate that soil-borne pathogens surrounding adult trees are microbial keystone species that locally influence interactions between seedlings and plant-associated bacteria.

TI  - Native soilborne pathogens equalize differences in competitive ability between plants of contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies
PY  - 2016
AB  - Soilborne pathogens can contribute to the maintenance of local plant diversity by reducing differences in competitive ability between co-occurring plant species. It has been hypothesized that efficient phosphorus (P) acquisition by plants in P-impoverished ecosystems might trade off against resistance to root pathogens. This could help explain high plant diversity in severely nutrient-impoverished ecosystems. However, empirical evidence of such a trade-off remains scarce. In hyperdiverse shrublands in south-western Australia, non-mycorrhizal cluster-rooted Proteaceae are very efficient at acquiring P. However, Proteaceae co-occur with many other plant species using other P-acquisition strategies, such as ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations. In a glasshouse experiment, we grew Proteaceae and ECM plant species from hyperdiverse shrublands alone and in competition with each other, and in the presence or absence of native soilborne pathogens (Phytophthora spp.). We hypothesized that native Phytophthora species are more detrimental to Proteaceae than co-occurring ECM plants, due to a trade-off between highly efficient P-acquisition and pathogen defence, and that this equalizes differences in competitive ability between these two plant groups. When seedlings were grown alone, biomass of non-mycorrhizal plants was reduced in the presence of Phytopthora, while ECM species were unaffected by this pathogen. When non-mycorrhizal and ECM species were planted together, ECM plants grew better in the presence of Phytophthora than in its absence, because Phytophthora reduced the growth of the non-mycorrhizal competitors. Growth of ECM plants was positively correlated with per cent root colonization by ECM fungi, but this was only significant when ECM plants were grown in the presence of Phytophthora. Synthesis. Our study shows that native soilborne pathogens equalized differences in competitive ability between seedlings of contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies, thus supporting the hypothesis proposing a trade-off between highly efficient P-acquisition and resistance against root pathogens. We found that non-mycorrhizal cluster-rooted species may be the most efficient at acquiring the growth-limiting resource, but that co-occurring ECM species are better defended against root pathogens. Our results suggest that native soilborne pathogens and ECM contribute to the maintenance of the plant hyperdiversity in severely P-impoverished ecosystems.

TI  - Employing plant functional groups to advance seed dispersal ecology and conservation
PY  - 2019
AB  - Seed dispersal enables plants to reach hospitable germination sites and escape natural enemies. Understanding when and how much seed dispersal matters to plant fitness is critical for understanding plant population and community dynamics. At the same time, the complexity of factors that determine if a seed will be successfully dispersed and subsequently develop into a reproductive plant is daunting. Quantifying all factors that may influence seed dispersal effectiveness for any potential seed-vector relationship would require an unrealistically large amount of time, materials and financial resources. On the other hand, being able to make dispersal predictions is critical for predicting whether single species and entire ecosystems will be resilient to global change. Building on current frameworks, we here posit that seed dispersal ecology should adopt plant functional groups as analytical units to reduce this complexity to manageable levels. Functional groups can be used to distinguish, for their constituent species, whether it matters (i) if seeds are dispersed, (ii) into what context they are dispersed and (iii) what vectors disperse them. To avoid overgeneralization, we propose that the utility of these functional groups may be assessed by generating predictions based on the groups and then testing those predictions against species-specific data. We suggest that data collection and analysis can then be guided by robust functional group definitions. Generalizing across similar species in this way could help us to better understand the population and community dynamics of plants and tackle the complexity of seed dispersal as well as its disruption.

TI  - Pathogen impacts on plant communities: unifying theory, concepts, and empirical work
PY  - 2011
AB  - Pathogens, like other consumers, mediate the outcome of competitive interactions between their host species. Ongoing efforts to integrate pathogens into plant community ecology could be accelerated by greater conceptual unification. Research on plant pathogens has mainly focused on a variety of disparate mechanisms—the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, plant–soil feedbacks, competition–defense trade-offs, escape of invasive plants from their enemies, and epidemic-driven community shifts—with limited recognition of how these mechanisms fit into the broader context of plant coexistence. Here, I extend an emerging theoretical framework for understanding species coexistence to include various pathogen impacts on plant communities. Pathogens can promote coexistence by regulating relative abundance or by reducing the disparities between species in fitness that make coexistence more difficult. Conversely, pathogens may undermine coexistence by creating positive feedbacks or by increasing between-species fitness differe...

TI  - Recruitment patterns and potential mechanisms of community assembly in an Andean cloud forest
PY  - 2015
AB  - Question
What are the conditions necessary for the establishment and development of seedlings and an early stage sapling community in an old-growth cloud forest? Cloud forests are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world; however, recruitment patterns in these forests remain largely unknown.

Location
Cloud Forest, Northern Peruvian Andes.

Methods
We constructed a sapling community model through the unconstrained technique of non-metric multidimensional scaling. We related the distribution of saplings of each species to the distance from conspecific adult (potential parent) trees through a point pattern analysis. We also used zero-inflated Poisson models to investigate the relationship between sapling distributions and environmental conditions and forest structure.

Results
We found that recruitment in woody plant species tends to be widely spread throughout the forest. The distribution of some sapling species was either positively or negatively related to the position of adult conspecific trees. Several species tended to occur within particular microhabitat conditions, with some differentiation between canopy and understorey species.

Conclusions
Cloud forest species recruitment may require the cover provided by the forest canopy. Under closed canopy conditions, both dispersal assembly and niche assembly mechanisms appear to simultaneously influence sapling distribution. The different strategies of various species may result in a trade-off between the importance of microhabitat conditions and distance mechanisms, with one prevailing over the other, depending on species and forest structure conditions.

TI  - Conspecific leaf litter induces negative feedbacks in Asteraceae seedlings
PY  - 2021
AB  - The plant soil feedback (PSF) framework has been instrumental in understanding the impacts of soil microbes on plant fitness and species coexistence. PSFs develop when soil microbial communities are altered due to the identity and density of a particular plant species, which can then enhance or inhibit the local survival and growth of that plant species as well as different plant species. The recent extension of the PSF framework to aboveground microbiota, termed here as plant phyllosphere feedbacks (PPFs), can also help to determine the impact of aboveground microbes on plant fitness and species interactions. However, experimental tests of PPFs during early plant growth are nascent and the prevalence of PPFs across diverse plant species remains unknown. Additionally, it is unclear whether plant host characteristics, such as functional traits or phylogenetic distance, may help to predict the strength and direction of PPFs. To test for the prevalence of litter-mediated PPFs, recently senesced plant litter from 10 native Asteraceae species spanning a range of life history strategies was used to inoculate seedlings of both conspecific and heterospecific species. We found that exposure to conspecific litter significantly reduced the growth of four species relative to exposure to heterospecific litter (i.e., significant negative PPFs), three species experienced marginally significant negative PPFs, and the PPF estimates for all 10 species were negative. However, neither plant functional traits, nor phylogenetic distance were predictive of litter feedbacks across plant species pairs, suggesting that other mechanisms or traits not measured may be driving conspecific negative PPFs. Our results indicate that negative, litter-mediated PPFs are common among native Asteraceae species and that they may have substantial impacts on plant growth and plant species interactions, particularly during early plant growth.

TI  - Tree spacing and area of competitive influence do not scale with tree size in an African rain forest
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Questions: Is the area of influence of individual trees determined by tree size? Does competition, inferred from spatial pattern between neighbouring trees, affect adult tree spacing patterns in an tropical forest? At what size-class or stage is competition between neighbours most likely to affect adult tree spacing patterns? Location: Kibale National Park, western Uganda. Methods: Relationships between focal tree size and nearest neighbour distance, size, density, and species in a 4-ha permanent plot, using point pattern analyses. Results: We found non-random patterns of distribution of nearest tree neighbours (stems > 10 cm DBH). Independent of identity, tree density was highest and neighbours were regularly spaced within 3–5m of an individual. Tree densities were lower and relatively constant at distances >5m and neighbours were typically randomly spaced. In general, conspecific patterns conformed to the latter trends. Thus, individual area of influence was small (within a radius of 3–5 m). Ra...

TI  - Phosphorus limitation, soil-borne pathogens and the coexistence of plant species in hyperdiverse forests and shrublands
PY  - 2014
AB  - Hyperdiverse forests occur in the lowland tropics, whereas the most species-rich shrublands are found in regions such as south-western Australia (kwongan) and South Africa (fynbos). Despite large differences, these ecosystems share an important characteristic: their soils are strongly weathered and phosphorus (P) is a key growth-limiting nutrient. Soil-borne pathogens are increasingly being recognized as drivers of plant diversity in lowland tropical rainforests, but have received little attention in species-rich shrublands. We suggest a trade-off in which the species most proficient at acquiring P have ephemeral roots that are particularly susceptible to soil-borne pathogens. This could equalize out the differences in competitive ability among co-occurring species in these ecosystems, thus contributing to coexistence. Moreover, effective protection against soil-borne pathogens by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi might explain the occurrence of monodominant stands of ECM trees and shrubs amongst otherwise species-rich communities. We identify gaps in our knowledge which need to be filled in order to evaluate a possible link between P limitation, fine root traits, soil-borne pathogens and local plant species diversity. Such a link may help to explain how numerous plant species can coexist in hyperdiverse rainforests and shrublands, and, conversely, how monodominant stands can develop in these ecosystems.

TI  - Food limitation and low-density populations of sympatric hamster species in North China
PY  - 2009
AB  - Although food has been proposed as a possible factor on population regulation of small mammals, evidence of food restriction in field conditions is still lacking. Food restriction is generally thought to occur in high-density years of oscillating populations of small mammals. By using two body condition indices (muscle protein concentration and cleaned carcass index), we investigated variations of body condition of the greater long-tailed hamster (Tscherskia triton) and the striped hamster (Cricetulus barabensis) in the Raoyang County of the North China Plain during a population decline- and low-phase from 1998 to 2003. Our laboratory experiments showed that food restriction reduced muscle protein concentration and cleaned carcass index of greater long-tailed hamster. We found there were significant differences in body condition of hamsters over the six years. Both the muscle protein concentration and cleaned carcass index of T. triton were significantly and positively correlated with its yearly trap successes, which reflected yearly population densities. Muscle protein concentration of C. barabensis was positively correlated with the total yield of the wheat. This observation supported the hypothesis on the in-phase relation between food resources or availability and rodent abundances. During the four seasons, muscle protein concentration of two species was highest in autumn, and lowest in summer. These two body condition indices of wild T. triton in summer and in low phases were similar to 60% food restricted animals raised in the laboratory, but significantly lower than nonfood-restricted animals. Our results indicated that malnutrition occurred in summer when food was not abundant, and in low density years with low grain production (an index reflecting food abundance of rodents) in our study region. Therefore, we concluded that food limitation may play an important role in seasonal and inter-annual population fluctuation of these two hamster species.

TI  - Effects of corallivory and coral colony density on coral growth and survival
PY  - 2021
AB  - A suite of processes drive variation in coral populations in space and time, yet our understanding of how variation in coral density affects coral performance is limited. Theory predicts that reductions in density can send coral populations into a predator pit, where concentrated corallivory maintains corals at low densities. In reality, how variation in coral density alters corallivory rates is poorly resolved. Here, we experimentally quantified the effects of corallivory and coral density on growth and survival of small colonies of the staghorn coral Acropora pulchra. Our findings suggest that coral density and corallivory have strong but independent effects on coral performance. In the presence of corallivores, corals suffered high but density-independent mortality. When corallivores were excluded, however, vertical extension rates of colonies increased with increasing densities. While we found no evidence for a predator pit, our results suggest that spatio-temporal variation in corallivore and coral densities can fundamentally alter population dynamics via strong effects on juvenile corals.

TI  - Spatial distribution patterns of Symplocos congeners in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaf forest of southern China
PY  - 2017
AB  - Studies on spatial distribution of congeneric species can supplement our understanding of species ecological processes. We analyzed population structure, spatial distribution, intra- and interspecific associations among six Symplocos tree species on a large (50 ha) plot in a subtropical, evergreen broad-leaf forest in southern China using spatial point pattern analysis methods. Our results suggested that the six Symplocos tree species were all clustered at small scales. The aggregation intensity of S. wikstroemiifolia with low abundance but relatively numerous large-diameter trees was much higher than that of the other five Symplocos species that occurred at high abundance but included few large-diameter trees. Spatial associations among the six congeners showed that 12 of 30 pairs were associated positively at small scales, and 13 of 30 pairs were unrelated. For species among different size classes, 79 of 120 pairs were not correlated, and 17 of 120 pairs were associated positively. These results showed insufficient evidence for interspecific competition and congeneric Symplocos species commonly coexist within subtropical plant communities. The spatial patterns of Symplocos species and their correlations changed with size (DBH) class and were simultaneously affected by spatial scales; the intensity of their aggregation and association decreased with increasing area of the sample plot.

TI  - Evolution of dispersal and mating systems along geographic gradients: implications for shifting ranges
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary
Dispersal affects species' ability to move or adapt in response to environmental change. Successful long-distance dispersal also requires reproduction in areas with few mates, thus mating systems, especially the capacity for self-fertilization, may influence the speed and success of range shifts.
Here, we review: the theoretical predictions regarding dispersal and mating-system evolution at equilibrium, expanding and contracting range limits; the empirical support for these predictions; and how these geographic patterns may influence future range evolution.
Equilibrium range limits can arise from environmental gradients in habitat quality, temporal variation or habitat heterogeneity. Dispersal has been predicted to increase or decrease towards range edges, depending on which life-history traits respond to the ecological gradient(s). In general, spatial habitat isolation selects against dispersal, whereas temporal stochasticity favours dispersal.
At expanding range fronts, dispersal should increase due to spatial sorting for dispersive individuals and the benefits of colonizing vacant habitat. Dispersal evolution is likely more constrained during native range shifts than invasions. Models of expansion across environmental gradients and during climate-tracking range shifts are lacking.
Little theory considers evolution at contracting range margins. We suggest that increased dispersal should be selected if there is local adaptation to climate, as dispersers from warmer areas will out-compete nondispersers no longer adapted to new climatic conditions. Dispersal increases should be more pronounced in regions where local adaptation is stronger.
Self fertilization may be favoured at equilibrium, expanding or contracting range margins by providing reproductive assurance. However, this benefit depends on how inbreeding depression is influenced by genetic load, the severity of the abiotic environment, and the competitive milieu in edge populations. Models for the joint evolution of mating and dispersal in plants suggest that although selfing may evolve at range limits, it will not necessarily be associated with high dispersal.
Empirical evidence to test these predictions is scarce. Geographic surveys of dispersal traits, mating-system traits and relevant selective factors are needed, especially studies of: (i) stable range limits that identify underlying environmental gradients; (ii) moving range limits that compare traits across space and time; and (iii) contracting limits that assess variation in local adaptation towards the range edge.

TI  - Frugivore diversity increases evenness in the seed rain on deforested tropical landscapes
PY  - 2021
AB  - <jats:p>The diversity of tropical forests is strongly shaped by mutualistic interactions involving plants and frugivores that disperse their seeds. However, it is little known how decreases in the diversity of frugivores can affect seed dispersal patterns, plant community composition and species' coexistence in tropical forest landscapes. Here, we investigated the effects of bird frugivore diversity on seed dispersal of rare plant species and on the magnitude of equalizing effects on the seed rain in open areas within 12 fragmented landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored the production of bird‐dispersed seeds and bird abundance in forest fragments, and sampled the seed rain and the activity of birds attracted to experimental tree nuclei established in neighboring pastures. The activity of frugivores in tree nuclei was positively correlated with the diversity of birds recorded in nearby forest fragments, and the seed rain diversity increased with frugivore activity. The proportion of seeds dispersed more frequently than expected by chance in tree nuclei increased linearly with the species' richness of birds. The richness and abundance of active frugivores in deforested areas promoted a seed rain with evenness and diversity up to five times greater than the seed pool available in forest fragments due to the proportional increase in the dispersal of rare plant species and a concomitant proportional decrease in the dispersal of dominant fruiting plants. Furthermore, every additional bird species detected in a site was associated with a 10% increase in the equalizing effect on dispersed seeds' relative abundance. Our results show that the aggregated behavior of avian frugivore communities on deforested areas results in higher species richness in the seed rain of plant communities and underscore the urgency to reduce bird species' loss and the simplification of their communities in tropical landscapes.</jats:p>

TI  - Impacts of logging on density-dependent predation of dipterocarp seeds in a South East Asian rainforest
PY  - 2011
AB  - Much of the forest remaining in South East Asia has been selectively logged. The processes promoting species coexistence may be the key to the recovery and maintenance of diversity in these forests. One such process is the Janzen–Connell mechanism, where specialized natural enemies such as seed predators maintain diversity by inhibiting regeneration near conspecifics. In Neotropical forests, anthropogenic disturbance can disrupt the Janzen–Connell mechanism, but similar data are unavailable for South East Asia. We investigated the effects of conspecific density (two spatial scales) and distance from fruiting trees on seed and seedling survival of the canopy tree Parashorea malaanonan in unlogged and logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia. The production of mature seeds was higher in unlogged forest, perhaps because high adult densities facilitate pollination or satiate pre-dispersal predators. In both forest types, post-dispersal survival was reduced by small-scale (1 m2) conspecific density, but not by proximity to the nearest fruiting tree. Large-scale conspecific density (seeds per fruiting tree) reduced predation, probably by satiating predators. Higher seed production in unlogged forest, in combination with slightly higher survival, meant that recruitment was almost entirely limited to unlogged forest. Thus, while logging might not affect the Janzen–Connell mechanism at this site, it may influence the recruitment of particular species.

TI  - Phylogenetic dependence of plant–soil feedback promotes rare species in a subtropical forest

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Negative plant–soil feedback (PSF) has been widely considered to be a primary mechanism maintaining plant diversity. Previous studies have shown that rare species suffer stronger negative conspecific PSF than common species, but it remains unclear how rare species persist if they are more strongly self‐limited.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we used shade‐house and field experiments to test soil feedback effects of phylogenetically related species on seedling growth, with seven species of contrasting local abundance, in a subtropical forest, China. We quantified the PSF of conspecifics and heterospecifics and assessed the phylogenetic dependence of the feedback.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Both experiments showed that although rare species suffered strong negative PSF in soils of conspecifics or phylogenetically close heterospecifics, no such feedback was found in the soils of phylogenetically distant heterospecifics. In contrast, common species had no or weak negative conspecific PSF but strong heterospecific soil PSF.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. The variation in the phylogenetically dependent PSF among rare and common species evidenced in this study ensures that rare species would grow well in the neighbourhood of phylogenetically distant heterospecifics but do poorly under their own or close relatives, while common species perform relatively well in their own neighbourhood but poorly in other's neighbourhood. This phylogenetically dependent PSF facilitates the rare–common species coexistence in communities.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Rodent post‐dispersal seed predation in deciduous woodland: predator response to absolute and relative abundance of prey
PY  - 1999
AB  - 1. The response of post-dispersal seed predators to changes in the absolute and relative abundance of seeds of two tree species: ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra) was studied in seminatural woodland in County Durham, UK.



2. Analysis examined two components of seed predation: seed encounter (the probability of at least one seed being removed) and seed exploitation (the proportion of seeds removed once encountered). Exclosure studies identified small mammals, particularly the woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) as the principal post-dispersal seed predators and revealed a marked preference (almost four-fold difference in encounter) for seeds of Ulmus over Fraxinus.



3. For both Fraxinus and Ulmus, a linear regression model described the relationship between seed density and the number of seeds removed by rodents more successfully than non-linear models. These relationships were maintained whether the species were presented singly or together with neither the slopes of Fraxinus or Ulmus changing significantly. These results indicate that, over the range of seed densities used, rodents consumed a constant proportion of seeds irrespective of seed density or frequency. The high rates of exploitation for Ulmus seeds suggests the slope of the relationship primarily reflects rates of encounter, whereas for Fraxinus it is a result of both low encounter and exploitation.



4. Linear regression identified seed removal by rodents to be frequency-independent both over the woodland as a whole and within each of six micro-habitats. This appeared to be a result of the marked preference for Ulmus over Fraxinus which was not reversed even when Ulmus was rare. Frequency-dependent seed predation by rodents is predicted to be most likely when both prey have similar low palatabilities.



5. When encountered by rodents, patches of Ulmus seeds were exploited almost completely, irrespective of seed density or frequency which suggests rodents have the potential to cause local extinction of Ulmus seed populations. In contrast, the lower rates of encounter and exploitation of Fraxinus seeds implies ample opportunities for prey escape.

TI  - Habitat associations of trees and seedlings in a Bornean rain forest
PY  - 2000
AB  - Summary


1 In species-rich mixed dipterocarp rain forest in Indonesian Borneo, we evaluated evidence for tree species associations with physical habitat variables (physiography for adults and seedlings, and light for seedlings). A total of 325 species were included in the analysis.



2 A stratified random sample of 28 tree and seedling plots (0.16 ha and 36 m2, respectively) was taken from a 150-ha study area on homogeneous parent rock (granite) between 110 and 270 m a.s.l.



3 In a principal component analysis (PCA), based on an abundance index of all tree species, plots segregated into three groups. These corresponded closely with the three physiographically defined habitat types assigned in the field: (i) plateaux with a deep humus layer, (ii) sharp ridges and upper slopes, and (iii) gullies and lower slopes near permanent streams. Segregation of plots by habitat was weaker when seedling (rather than tree) species abundance was used in the PCA.



4 In single species analyses, using Monte Carlo randomization tests, we found significant associations with the three physiographic habitat types in 17 out of 49 abundant species for trees, and in 5 out of 22 abundant species for seedlings. In PCA and single species analyses, weaker associations with habitat for seedlings than for trees suggest higher mortality of seedlings in ‘suboptimal’ habitats.



5 Seedlings of 8 out of 45 abundant species were also significantly and positively associated with high light availability (measured in 2 × 2 m subplots, using hemispherical photographs).



6 Combining light and physiographic habitat associations, 20 out of the 45 abundant species were associated with at least one habitat factor as either adults or seedlings.



7 Thus, the distributions and abundances of many species are influenced by local heterogeneity in physical habitat variables. However, about half of the abundant species (25 of 45) showed no significant habitat association as adults or seedlings, and in no case did the relative abundance of any species exceed 5% in its ‘preferred’ habitat.

TI  - Experimental evidence for a phylogenetic Janzen–Connell effect in a subtropical forest
PY  - 2011
AB  - Observational evidence increasingly suggests that the Janzen–Connell effect extends beyond the species boundary. However, this has not been confirmed experimentally. Herein, we present both observational and experimental evidence for a phylogenetic Janzen–Connell effect. In a subtropical forest in Guangdong province, China, we observed that co-occurring tree species are less phylogenetically related than expected. The inhibition effects of neighbouring trees on seedling survival decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between them. In a shade-house experiment, we studied seedling survival of eight species on soil collected close to Castanopsis fissa relative to their survival on soil close to their own adult trees, and found that this relative survival rate increased with phylogenetic distance from C. fissa. This phylogenetic signal disappeared when seedlings were planted in fungicide-treated soil. Our results clearly support negative effects of phylogenetically similar neighbouring trees on seedling survival and suggest that these effects are caused by associated hostspecific fungal pathogens.

TI  - Tree seedling richness, but not neighborhood composition, influences insect herbivory in a temperate deciduous forest community.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Insect herbivores can serve as important regulators of plant dynamics, but their impacts in temperate forest understories have received minimal attention at local scales. Here, we test several related hypotheses about the influence of plant neighborhood composition on insect leaf damage in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA. Using data on seedlings and adult trees sampled at 36 sites over an approximately 900 ha area, we tested for the effects of total plant density, rarefied species richness (i.e., resource concentration and dietary-mixing hypotheses), conspecific density (i.e., Janzen–Connell hypothesis), and heterospecific density (i.e., herd-immunity hypothesis), on the proportion of leaf tissue removed from 290 seedlings of 20 species. We also tested for the effects of generic- and familial-level neighborhoods. Our results showed that the proportion of leaf tissue removed ranged from zero to just under 50% across individuals, but was generally quite low (<2%). Using linear mixed models, we found a significant negative relationship between insect damage and rarefied species richness, but no relationship with neighborhood density or composition. In addition, leaf damage had no significant effect on subsequent seedling growth or survival, likely due to the low levels of damage experienced by most individuals. Our results provide some support for the resource concentration hypothesis, but suggest a limited role for insect herbivores in driving local-scale seedling dynamics in temperate forest understories.

TI  - Rethinking Community Assembly through the Lens of Coexistence Theory
PY  - 2012
AB  - Although research on the role of competitive interactions during community assembly began decades ago, a recent revival of interest has led to new discoveries and research opportunities. Using contemporary coexistence theory that emphasizes stabilizing niche differences and relative fitness differences, we evaluate three empirical approaches for studying community assembly. We show that experimental manipulations of the abiotic or biotic environment, assessments of trait-phylogeny-environment relationships, and investigations of frequency-dependent population growth all suggest strong influences of stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences on the outcome of plant community assembly. Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and community structure. Combining current approaches represents our best chance of achieving this goal, which is fundamental to conceptual ecology and to the management of plant communities under global change.

TI  - Do large forest trees tend towards high species mingling
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Effects caused by human management and natural disturbances as well as by ecological mechanisms such as those described, for example, by the Janzen-Connell and the herd immunity hypotheses play an important role in maintaining species diversity. These processes are often accompanied by local size-hierarchy effects and as a likely consequence of them we hypothesised that large plants generally have a tendency to show high species mingling, where plants and their nearest neighbours are heterospecific. To carry out a first benchmark study in forests from different parts of Europe, Africa and North America, we selected spatial data from twelve forest ecosystems and analysed the mingling situation based on an index of spatial species mingling. Using stem diameter at breast height and stem diameter differentiation among the nearest neighbours as explanatory variables we then applied logistic regression to explain mingling probability. Overall we found significant support for the expectation that large trees and trees growing at low local densities often (75% of all analysed forest stands) have indeed a tendency towards high species mingling. This supports our expectation that the tendency of larger trees towards high species mingling generally is either a consequence of disturbances/forest management or of the aforementioned ecological processes, although a few forest stands also deviated from the expected pattern. We also found that size differentiation and species mingling are strongly related in local neighbourhoods. Thus the results of our study strongly support the view that local species richness promotes local size hierarchy irrespective of climate zone. This leads to situations where in local neighbourhoods with large size diversity there is also high mingling and vice versa. This allows conservation to focus on maintaining or improving one diversity aspect, e.g. size diversity, whilst obtaining the other, e.g. species mingling, as a by-product.

TI  - Modelling how negative plant-soil feedbacks across life stages affect the spatial patterning of trees.
PY  - 2023
AB  - In this work, we theoretically explore how litter decomposition processes and soil-borne pathogens contribute to negative plant-soil feedbacks, in particular in transient and stable spatial organisation of tropical forest trees and seedlings known as Janzen-Connell distributions. By considering soil-borne pathogens and autotoxicity both separately and in combination in a phenomenological model, we can study how both factors may affect transient dynamics and emerging Janzen-Connell distributions. We also identify parameter regimes associated with different long-term behaviours. Moreover, we compare how the strength of negative plant-soil feedbacks was mediated by tree germination and growth strategies, using a combination of analytical approaches and numerical simulations. Our interdisciplinary investigation, motivated by an ecological question, allows us to construct important links between local feedbacks, spatial self-organisation, and community assembly. Our model analyses contribute to understanding the drivers of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems, by disentangling the abilities of two potential mechanisms to generate Janzen-Connell distributions. Furthermore, our theoretical results may help guiding future field data analyses by identifying spatial signatures in adult tree and seedling distribution data that may reflect the presence of particular plant-soil feedback mechanisms.

TI  - Patterns of local species richness and their associations with functional traits in a 60-ha tropical forest dynamics plot
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Understanding the underlying mechanisms of diversity maintenance in tropics remains a challenge for ecologists. To reveal the underlying mechanism from a plant‐eye‐view perspective, we examined the patterns of local species richness which was defined as the number of species around individuals of a target species within circles of different radii and their correlations with major plant functional traits in a tropical montane rainforest. In 2012, we established a 60‐ha forest dynamics plot (FDP) in tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China. In 2013, we measured eight functional traits (specific leaf area [SLA], leaf dry matter content [LDMC], wood density, potential maximum height, leaf carbon content [LCC], leaf nitrogen content [LNC], leaf phosphorus content [LPC], and leaf potassium content) of all the species in the FDP. Based on all the mapped individuals that had a diameter at breast height ≥10 cm, we utilized individual species–area relationships function (ISAR<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>)) combined with the heterogeneous Poisson null model to quantify the patterns of local species richness at scales from 1 to 50 m. Regression analysis was used to determine which functional traits could influence the local diversity pattern. Results showed that the 123 ISAR<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>) curves were relatively similar and no species seemed to be extremely higher or lower than the average of all the ISAR<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>) curves. The percentage of species that behaved predominantly as accumulators or repellers or neutrally was 42.23%, 13.82%, and 43.9% at scale of &lt;30 m, respectively. But at scales ≥30 m, more than 70% of all species behaved neutrally suggesting that facilitative interactions probably occurred when neighborhoods were &lt;30 m apart. Among the eight measured traits, the SLA, LNC, and LPC were negatively associated with local species richness. Our results indicated that (1) the spatial community structure was not controlled by key species; (2) facilitative interactions played an important role in local diversity maintenance; (3) species with conservative functional trait syndromes were more likely to have relatively high local species richness in the tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China.</jats:p>

TI  - Prevalence of phylogenetic clustering at multiple scales in an African rain forest tree community
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary 1. In highly diverse ecosystems, such as tropical forests, the relative importance of mechanisms underlying species coexistence (e.g. habitat filtering, competitive exclusion, neutral dynamics) is still poorly known and probably varies depending on spatial and phylogenetic scales. 2. Here, we develop new approaches for dissecting simultaneously the phylogenetic structure of communities at different phylogenetic depths and spatial scales. We tested with simulations that our method is able to disentangle overdispersion and clustering effects occurring at contrasted phylogenetic depths. 3. We applied our approaches to a 50 ha Forest Dynamic Plot located in Korup National Park (Cameroon) where 329,000 tree stems ≥ 1 cm in diameter were identified and mapped, and using a newly generated dated molecular phylogenetic tree based on 2 plastid loci (rbcL and matK), including 272 species from Korup (97% of the individuals). 4. Significant patterns of phylogenetic turnover were detected across 20 9 20 m 2 quadrats at most spatial scales, with higher turnover between topographic habitats than within habitats, indicating the prevalence of habitat filtering processes. Spatial phylogenetic clustering was detected over the entire range of phylogenetic depths indicating that competitive exclusion does not generate a pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion at this scale, even at a shallow phylogenetic depth. 5. Using an individual-based approach, we also show that closely related species tended to aggregate spatially until a scale of 1 m. However, the signal vanishes at smaller distance, suggesting that competitive exclusion can balance the impact of environmental filtering at a very fine spatial scale. 6. Synthesis. Using new methods to characterize the structure of communities across spatial and phylogenetic scales, we inferred the relative importance of the mechanisms underlying species coexistence in tropical forests. Our analysis confirms that environmental filtering processes are key in the structuring of natural communities at most spatial scales. Although negative-density tends to limit coexistence of closely related species at very short distance (<1 m), its influence is largely veiled by environmental filtering at larger distances.

For beta-diversity, a higher value was observed in the substory layer (0.221) compared to both the canopy layer (0.161) and the understory layer (0.158). We also found that the species abundance distance matrix of biological and soil environmental factors were significantly correlated with species geographic distance matrices.

TI  - Linking ecological processes with spatial and non‐spatial patterns in plant communities
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Attempts to infer underlying ecological process from observed patterns in ecology have been widespread, but have generally relied on first-order (non-spatial) community characteristics such as the species abundance distribution (SAD). This measure has become an important test of several theories of species coexistence, but has proved unsuccessful in distinguishing between them. 2. Spatially explicit data are increasingly available for a range of ecological communities, and analysis methods for these data are well developed. However, relatively little work has investigated the potential of these data for similar inference about mechanisms of coexistence. 3. In this study, we systematically investigate the spatial and non-spatial signals of simulated ecological processes. We include neutral, niche, lottery, Janzen–Connell and heteromyopia models, deriving and comparing first- and second-order measures for the patterns they generate. 4. We find that the SAD is unable to distinguish reliably between underlying models, with random variation in its shape concealing any systematic differences. 5. A new second-order summary measure of spatial structure derived in this paper, in contrast, proves highly sensitive to the type of ecological interaction being modelled, and is robust to random variation. 6. Synthesis. A simple summary measure of the spatial structure of plant communities is presented and found to be a more powerful indicator of underlying process in simulated data than a widely used first-order measure, the SAD. The potential for answering important ecological questions using spatial statistics, particularly concerning mechanisms of coexistence in diverse communities, appears to be great.

TI  - Analyses of three-dimensional species associations reveal departures from neutrality in a tropical forest.
PY  - 2022
AB  - The study of community spatial structure is central to understanding diversity patterns over space and species co-occurrence at local scales. Although most analytical approaches consider horizontal and vertical dimensions separately, in this study we introduce a three-dimensional spatial analysis that simultaneously includes horizontal and vertical species associations. Using tree census data (2000-2016) and allometries from the Luquillo forest plot in Puerto Rico, we show that spatial organization becomes less random over time as the forest recovered from land-use legacy effects and hurricane disturbance. Tree species vertical segregation is predominant in the forest with almost all species that co-occur in the horizontal plane avoiding each other in the vertical dimension. Horizontal segregation is less common than vertical, whereas three-dimensional aggregation (a proxy for direct tree competition) is the least frequent type of spatial association. Furthermore, dominant species are involved in more non-random spatial associations, implying that species co-occurrence is facilitated by species segregation in space. This novel three-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify and quantify tree species spatial distributions, how interspecific competition was reduced through forest structure, and how it changed over time after disturbance, in ways not detectable from two-dimensional analyses alone.

TI  - Inference in incidence, infection, and impact: Co-infection of multiple hosts by multiple pathogens
PY  - 2009
AB  - A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications, such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings, the \one host-one pathogen" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how im- pacts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources (cul- tures, gene sequencing, and survival observations), and the inference problem in- cludes not only parameters that describe environmental in∞uences on pathogen in- cidence, infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves{pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental in∞uences on host survival. We demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts, where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing.

TI  - Analysis of a negative plant–soil feedback in a subtropical monsoon forest
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. The Janzen–Connell hypothesis provides explanations for species coexistence and predicts that recruitment of tree juveniles is reduced by host-specific enemies, particularly soil biota. Previous studies, however, have not fully addressed the aspect of host specificity. Using a legume tree (Ormosia glaberrima) in a subtropical monsoon forest as a model, we experimentally investigated the mechanisms underlying a Janzen–Connell effect. 2. A negative plant–soil feedback was identified by a field census and confirmed by planting surface-sterilized seeds at different densities around focal trees. Fungicides were applied to test whether the effects were caused by fungi. In a growth-room inoculation experiment, effects of collected soil samples on seedling survival were examined and compared to soil samples treated with fungicides. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequence of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene was used for pathogen identification. The fungus causing seedling mortality was isolated and characterized by ITS rDNA sequencing and inoculation experiments. 3. A Janzen–Connell effect was identified at a field site, in which O. glaberrima was a locally common species. In situ treatments with fungicides and a corresponding growth-room simulation experiment showed that seedling survival depended on the distance to focal adult trees and that a fungal pathogen attacked seeds and seedlings. No negative plant–soil feedback was observed at another field site with a single O. glaberrima tree, indicating a locally rare species advantage. 4. The disease-inducing fungus was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. Inoculation experiments showed that the isolated fungus was pathogenic on O. glaberrima seedlings, but non-pathogenic on seedlings from other tree species co-occurring with O. glaberrima. Moreover, susceptibility of O. glaberrima depended on seed provenance (likely genotype). 5. Synthesis. We demonstrate that an observed negative plant–soil feedback on a locally common legume tree is caused by a host-specific pathogen. Our data fully support the criteria of spatially unequal pathogen distribution and host specificity proposed in the Janzen–Connell model. Taken the interaction between O. glaberrima and F. oxysporum as a paradigm, we suggest that host-specific pathogens, locally accumulated around parent trees, are important determinants of tree community structure.

TI  - ForestGEO: Understanding forest diversity and dynamics through a global observatory network
PY  - 2021
AB  - ForestGEO is a network of scientists and long-term forest dynamics plots (FDPs) spanning the Earth's major forest types. ForestGEO's mission is to advance understanding of the diversity and dynamics of forests and to strengthen global capacity for forest science research. ForestGEO is unique among forest plot networks in its large-scale plot dimensions, censusing of all stems ≥1 cm in diameter, inclusion of tropical, temperate and boreal forests, and investigation of additional biotic (e.g., arthropods) and abiotic (e.g., soils) drivers, which together provide a holistic view of forest functioning. The 71 FDPs in 27 countries include approximately 7.33 million living trees and about 12,000 species, representing 20% of the world's known tree diversity. With >1300 published papers, ForestGEO researchers have made significant contributions in two fundamental areas: species coexistence and diversity, and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, defining the major biotic and abiotic controls on the distribution and coexistence of species and functional types and on variation in species' demography has led to improved understanding of how the multiple dimensions of forest diversity are structured across space and time and how this diversity relates to the processes controlling the role of forests in the Earth system. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps remain that impede our ability to predict how forest diversity and function will respond to climate change and other stressors. Meeting these global research challenges requires major advances in standardizing taxonomy of tropical species, resolving the main drivers of forest dynamics, and integrating plot-based ground and remote sensing observations to scale up estimates of forest diversity and function, coupled with improved predictive models. However, they cannot be met without greater financial commitment to sustain the long-term research of ForestGEO and other forest plot networks, greatly expanded scientific capacity across the world's forested nations, and increased collaboration and integration among research networks and disciplines addressing forest science.

TI  - Neighbourhood defence gene similarity effects on tree performance: a community transcriptomic approach
PY  - 2017
AB  - <jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The structure and dynamics of ecological communities are ultimately the outcome of the differential demographic rates of individuals. Individual growth and mortality rates largely result from the interaction between an organism's phenotype and the abiotic and biotic environment. Functional traits have been used extensively over the past decade to elucidate links among phenotypes, demography and community dynamics.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>A fundamental weakness of most functional trait approaches is the use of ‘soft’ traits associated with resource acquisition to examine how neighbourhood similarity affects tree survival and growth. However, these ‘soft’ traits are unlikely to be good predictors of similarities among co‐occurring species. Less easily measured aspects of organismal function – such as those related to defence – have frequently gone unmeasured. This is particularly problematic for testing important hypotheses in forest ecology, such as the Janzen–Connell hypothesis where focal trees are expected to be at a disadvantage if their neighbours share the same natural enemies.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>A potential alternative to functional trait approaches is to quantify the transcriptomic or functional genomic similarity of species. Such analyses are now possible in natural systems where <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> transciptome assemblies can be used to conduct functional phylogenomic analyses where homologous gene trees are produced. Using demographic plot data for 21 species from a North American forest dynamic plot, we conduct a community functional phylogenomic analysis of a plant community to elucidate the similarity in defence response genes across species. This similarity was then used to ask whether the similarity in defence genes of heterospecific species in the local neighbourhood of a focal individual tree influences its growth and mortality rates.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The results show that individual growth rates are higher when surrounded by dissimilar heterospecific species for 16 of 27 defence genes analysed. Additionally, survival rates are increased when an individual is in a neighbourhood with dissimilar species for 4 of the 27 defence genes studied. Lastly, strong conspecific effects were found in all analyses, underscoring that future analyses investigating the genetic variation and differential expression of defence‐related genes in neighbourhoods may prove important.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. In summary, this research leverages recent advances in <jats:styled-content style="fixed-case">RNA</jats:styled-content> sequencing and bioinformatics to conduct community‐wide transcriptomic analyses and analyses of defence‐related gene similarity across a tree community. The results demonstrate that defence gene similarity in neighbourhoods often does have negative effects on individual demographic performance as predicted by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Do benefits of seed dispersal and caching by scatterhoarders outweigh the costs of predation? An example with oaks and yellow-necked mice
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Numerous interactions between plants and animals vary in their outcome between antagonism and mutualism. Interactions between plants and scatter‐hoarding animals provide a prime example of this phenomenon. Scatterhoarders consume large quantities of seeds (potentially reducing plant establishment), yet also disperse seeds and bury them in shallow caches (potentially improving recruitment). Despite intense work on mechanisms that cause these interactions to shift along an antagonism–mutualism continuum, it remains difficult to quantify their final outcomes.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We demonstrate how readily available field data can be used to reach this goal, with interactions between rodents and two oaks species (sessile oak <jats:italic>Quercus petraea</jats:italic>, and red oak <jats:italic>Q. rubra</jats:italic>) as an empirical example. Our approach consists of quantifying the net outcome of the interaction through collecting data on different vital rates (e.g. probability that cached seeds survive to germination, probability of seedling recruitment with and without rodents; near and far from conspecific trees; with and without seed pilferage) and assembling them in a simple mathematical model.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that during the period of the study, interactions between scatter‐hoarding rodents and both focal oaks were antagonistic. Even though caching increased the likelihood of seedling establishment, this effect was not strong enough to compensate for the costs of seed predation. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the short‐distance transportation that is usually provided by small mammals benefited early oak recruitment.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our empirical results demonstrated that certain common assumptions – that caching by rodents invariably benefits plant recruitment; that improved seedling establishment after seed burial is sufficient to make plant–scatterhoarder interactions mutualistic; that transportation away from maternal plants is highly beneficial—do not always hold and should be tested rather than taken for granted.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Fungal community dissimilarity predicts plant-soil feedback strength in a lowland tropical forest.
PY  - 2023
AB  - Soil microbes impact plant community structure and diversity through plant-soil feedbacks. However, linking the relative abundance of plant pathogens and mutualists to differential plant recruitment remains challenging. Here, we tested for microbial mediation of pairwise feedback using a reciprocal transplant experiment in a lowland tropical forest in Panama paired with amplicon sequencing of soil and roots. We found evidence that plant species identity alters the microbial community, and these changes in microbial composition alter subsequent growth and survival of conspecific plants. We also found that greater community dissimilarity between species in their arbuscular mycorrhizal and nonpathogenic fungi predicted increased positive feedback. Finally, we identified specific microbial taxa across our target functional groups that differentially accumulated under conspecific settings. Collectively, these findings clarify how soil pathogens and mutualists mediate net feedback effects on plant recruitment, with implications for management and restoration.

TI  - Theoretical Perspectives on Evolution of Long-Distance Dispersal and the Example of Specialized Pests
PY  - 2003
AB  - Long-distance dispersal (LDD)—dispersal beyond the bounds of the local patch or cluster of conspecifics—will be most advantageous in landscapes in which large areas of suitable habitat are consistently available at long distances from established populations. We review conditions under which LDD will be selected and conclude that biotic interactions, and in particular specialized natural enemies, are likely to be one of the most important factors selecting for LDD in many species. We use simple spatially implicit and spatially explicit models to illustrate how such pests affect the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for investment in LDD. Patches currently occupied by parents are more likely to be infected than distant, potentially unoccupied, patches, thus advantaging dispersal. Patchy infestations also result in higher variance in reproductive success among patches, which alone selects for increased among-patch dispersal. Both of these effects increase with the strength of the impact of infestation, and with the number of species competing for space in the community. We discuss the potential of different types of models and analytical tools to capture the impacts of pests on the evolution of LDD, and conclude that even simple models can illustrate the general relationship between pest pressure and LDD advantage, but only spatially explicit simulation models can fully elucidate the resulting ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In conclusion, we consider the potential role of selection for LDD in the spread of invasive species, and in long-term responses to habitat fragmentation and range shifts.

TI  - Forest tree community ecology and plant–soil feedback: Theory and evidence
PY  - 2024
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Mounting evidence suggests that reciprocal interactions between plants and the soil microbiota can be a primary force that generates key macroscopic patterns of plant communities (coexistence, dominance, and succession) in forest ecosystems. The aim of this article is to review empirical and theoretical perspectives of plant–soil feedback research in the context of forest community ecology. I first use a simple theoretical model to get insights into an array of the dynamics generated by plant–soil feedback: negative plant–soil feedback maintains plant species diversity and reduces plant growth, while positive plant–soil feedback drives plant growth of certain species and hence their dominance. I then describe how ecologists have unveiled the enormously complex plant‐microbiota interaction (i.e., the soil conditioning experiment) and review the linkage of plant–soil feedback with three key plant community patterns: (i) dominance, (ii) spatial structure and (iii) succession. I highlight one belowground plant trait (mycorrhizal type) that can mediate these linkages: arbuscular mycorrhizal species tend to exhibit negative plant–soil feedback while ectomycorrhizal species tend to exhibit positive plant–soil feedback. Although mycorrhizal plant–soil feedback potentially explains the patterns of tree diversity from local to global scales, many questions remain. Future studies should expand plant–soil feedback theory to incorporate numerous other feedback mechanisms and test how mycorrhizal types mediate the net feedback effects that could propagate to shape large‐scale forest structures and dynamics.</jats:p>

TI  - Seedling performance in a dioecious tree species is similar near female and male conspecific adults despite differences in colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Plant–soil feedbacks (PSFs) are a key driver of species diversity and composition in plant communities worldwide; however, the factors that may cause feedbacks to vary within species are rarely examined. In dioecious species, the strength of feedbacks may differ near female plants that produce seed versus near male plants (which do not) because repeated inputs of seeds and high seedling densities near females may cause accumulation of host‐specific soil microbes that influence seedling performance. To test whether conspecific seedling performance is reduced near seed‐producing female trees relative to male or heterospecific trees, we conducted shadehouse and field experiments with a dioecious tropical tree species, <jats:italic>Virola surinamensis</jats:italic> (Myristicaceae), on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The shadehouse experiment isolated the effect of soil microbial communities on seedling growth and allowed us to quantify colonization by mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, while the field experiment allowed us to assess seedling survival and growth in the presence of nearby conspecific adults and seedlings. In both experiments, seedling performance was similar between seedlings grown in the soil microbial communities and field environments underneath female conspecific, male conspecific, and heterospecific trees. However, contrary to expectation, seedling colonization by AM fungi was higher in male conspecific soil microbial communities than in female or heterospecific soil microbial communities at the end of the shadehouse experiment. Together, our experiments show that while differences among female and male plants in dioecious species may influence the association of conspecific seedlings with AM fungi in their soils, this variation does not necessarily translate directly to differences in seedling performance, at least over the time frame of our experiments. Studies of additional dioecious species are needed to help determine differences in soil microbial communities beneath male and female plants and to assess the role of seed input versus adult root systems in driving PSFs.</jats:p>

TI  - The relative importance of Janzen-Connell effects in influencing the spatial patterns at the Gutianshan subtropical forest.
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis is among the most important theories put forward to explain species coexistence in species-rich communities. However, the relative importance of Janzen-Connell effects with respect to other prominent mechanisms of community assembly, such as dispersal limitation, self-thinning due to competition, or habitat association, is largely unresolved. Here we use data from a 24-ha Gutianshan subtropical forest to address it. First we tested for significant associations of adults, juveniles, and saplings with environmental variables. Second we evaluated if aggregation decreased with life stage. In a third analysis we approximately factored out the effect of habitat association and comprehensively analyzed the spatial associations of intraspecific adults and offspring (saplings, juveniles) of 46 common species at continuous neighborhood distances. We found i) that, except for one, all species were associated with at least one environmental variable during at least one of their life stages, but the frequency of significant habitat associations declined with increasing life stage; ii) a decline in aggregation with increasing life stage that was strongest from juveniles to adults; and iii) intraspecific adult-offspring associations were dominated by positive relationships at neighborhood distances up to 10 m. Our results suggest that Janzen-Connell effects were not the dominant mechanisms in structuring the spatial patterns of established trees in the subtropical Gutianshan forest. The spatial patterns may rather reflect the joint effects of size-dependent self-thinning, dispersal limitation and habitat associations. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the relative importance of Janzen-Connell effects in influencing plant community structure under strong topographic heterogeneity.

TI  - Plant traits predict inter‐ and intraspecific variation in susceptibility to herbivory in a hyperdiverse Neotropical rain forest tree community
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary 1. A key issue in plant/herbivore interaction research is to understand which plant traits drive differ- ences in herbivore damage. Variation in chemical, physical or phenological traits of plants may all modulate the degree of herbivore damage among species and individuals, yet the relative importance of these factors is still subject to debate, particularly in species-rich systems such as tropical rain forests. 2. To address this issue, we quantified leaf herbivore damage in 28 common tree species of the Yasun! i forest dynamic plot (YFDP) in the Ecuadorian Amazon over 11 months. Census data from the YFDP allowed us to quantify several aspects of tree ecology potentially affecting herbivory including leaf turnover and spatial distribution patterns. We measured six chemical, eight physical and four ecological traits of the focal species. Using a combination of multivariate analyses and phy- logenetic generalized linear regression model (PGLS), we assessed trade-offs between physical and chemical traits and the relative effect of all these traits on leaf herbivore damage. 3. Herbivore damage was highly variable among species and individuals, with leaves on average displaying damage over 13.4% (2.5-29.5%) of their area. We found no significant trade-off between physical and chemical defences for the 28 studied tree species. Overall, leaf size, shearing resistance, cellulose, ash content and leaf size 9 ash were the best predictors of herbivore damage. Surpris- ingly, condensed tannins and latex did not significantly correlate with herbivore damage. In addition, we found no relationships between herbivory and local tree density. However, we did find a weak effect of tree clustering and strong effect of tree leaf turnover rates on herbivore damage. 4. Synthesis. In the western Amazon, leaves are defended against herbivores through a combination of physical (toughness), chemical (toughness-related elements), and phenological (rapid leaf replace- ment) characteristics that do not appear to be subject to obvious trade-offs. Conventional strategies, such as condensed tannins or latex, do not seem to be strongly involved as a defence against herbi- vores in this community.

TI  - Trade-offs in seedling growth and survival within and across tropical forest microhabitats.
PY  - 2014
AB  - For niche differences to maintain coexistence of sympatric species, each species must grow and/or survive better than each of the others in at least one set of conditions (i.e., performance trade-offs). However, the extent of niche differentiation in tropical forests remains highly debated. We present the first test of performance trade-offs for wild seedlings in a tropical forest. We measured seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and survival of four common native woody species across 18 light, substrate, and topography microhabitats over 2.5 years within Hawaiian montane wet forest, an ideal location due to its low species diversity and strong species habitat associations. All six species pairs exhibited significant performance trade-offs across microhabitats and for RGR versus survival within microhabitats. We also found some evidence of performance equivalence, with species pairs having similar performance in 26% of comparisons across microhabitats. Across species, survival under low light was generally positively associated with RGR under high light. When averaged over all species, topography (slope, aspect, and elevation) explained most of the variation in RGR attributable to microhabitat variables (51–53%) followed by substrate type (35–37%) and light (11–12%). However, the relative effects of microhabitat differed among species and RGR metric (i.e., RGR for height, biomass, or leaf area). These findings indicate that performance trade-offs among species during regeneration are common in low-diversity tropical forest, although other mechanisms may better explain the coexistence of species with small performance differences.

TI  - Species co-existence in an Australian subtropical rain forest: evidence for compensatory mortality
PY  - 1999
AB  - 1 The relationship between the distribution of juveniles and conspecific trees was examined in a subtropical rain forest in south-east Queensland (Australia) to determine the role of compensatory mortality in maintaining the species richness of the forest. 2 Two species. which were among the most common canopy trees at the site, showed some evidence that the abundance of juveniles was reduced in the vicinity of conspecific trees. This spacing effect was particularly marked in Sloanea woollsii, but also present in Doryphora sassafras. The probability of finding juveniles of these species decreased as a function of (i) decreasing distance from the quadrats to the nearest conspecific tree and (ii) increasing density of conspecific trees (Sloanea woollsii only). In addition, these species accounted for a smaller proportion of the total number of juveniles close to conspecifics than they did at greater distances. 3 In contrast, the juveniles of a number of other species were more commonly found in the vicinity of conspecific trees. Two species had juveniles that were comparatively poorly dispersed: Acmena ingens and Polyosma cunninghamii juveniles were seldom found more than 10m and 15m away from conspecific trees. 4 Compensatory mortality might be necessary to prevent other species from being excluded by the two most common species, but it does not appear to be sufficient to explain how the majority of species co-exist with each other.

TI  - Conspecific plant–soil feedbacks reduce survivorship and growth of tropical tree seedlings
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary

1. The Janzen–Connell (J–C) Model proposes that host-specific enemies maintain high tree species diversity by reducing seedling performance near conspecific adults and promoting replacement by heterospecific seedlings. Support for this model often comes from decreased performance for a species at near versus far distances from conspecific adults. However, the relative success of conspecific versus heterospecific seedlings recruiting under a given tree species is a critical, but untested, component of the J–C Model.



2. In a shade-house experiment, we tested plant–soil feedbacks as a J–C mechanism in six tropical tree species. We assessed effects of conspecific versus heterospecific cultured soil extracts on seedling performance for each species, and we compared performance of conspecific versus heterospecific seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by a particular tree species. Additionally, we tested whether soil microbes were creating these plant–soil feedbacks and whether low light increased species vulnerability to pathogens.



3. Among 30 potential comparisons of survival and mass for seedlings grown in conspecific versus heterospecific soil extracts, survival decreased in seven and increased in two, whereas mass decreased in 13 and increased in 1. To integrate survival and growth, we also examined seedling performance [(mean total mass × mean survival time)/(days of experiment)], which was lower in 16 and higher in 2 of 30 comparisons between seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by conspecific versus heterospecific individuals. Based on performance within a soil extract, conspecific seedlings were disadvantaged in 15 and favoured in 7 of 30 cases relative to heterospecific seedlings.



4. Species pairwise interactions of soil modification and seedling performance occurred regardless of sterilization, suggesting chemical mediation. Microbes lacked host-specificity and reduced performance regardless of extract source and irradiance.



5. Synthesis. These results, along with parallel research in temperate forests, suggest that plant–soil feedbacks are an important component of seedling dynamics in both ecosystems. However, negative conspecific feedbacks were more prevalent in tropical than temperate species. Thus, negative plant–soil feedbacks appear to facilitate species coexistence via negative distance-dependent processes in tropical but not temperate forests, but the feedbacks were mediated through chemical effects rather than through natural enemies as expected under the J–C Model.

TI  - Genetic evidence for a Janzen-Connell recruitment pattern in reproductive offspring of Pinus halepensis trees.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Effective seed dispersal, combining both dispersal and postdispersal (establishment) processes, determines population dynamics and colonization ability in plants. According to the Janzen–Connell (JC) model, high mortality near the mother plant shifts the offspring establishment distribution farther away from the mother plant relative to the seed dispersal distribution. Yet, extending this prediction to the distribution of mature (reproductive) offspring remains a challenge for long-living plants. To address this challenge, we selected an isolated natural Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) population in Mt. Pithulim (Israel), which expanded from five ancestor trees in the beginning of the 20th century into ∼2000 trees today. Using nine microsatellite markers, we assigned parents to trees established during the early stages of population expansion. To elucidate the effect of the distance from the mother plant on postdispersal survival, we compared the effective seed dispersal kernel, based on the distribution of mother–offspring distances, with the seed dispersal kernel, based on simulations of a mechanistic wind dispersal model. We found that the mode of the effective dispersal kernel is shifted farther away than the mode of the seed dispersal kernel, reflecting increased survival with increasing distance from the mother plant. The parentage analysis demonstrated a highly skewed reproductive success and a strong directionality in effective dispersal corresponding to the wind regime. We thus provide compelling evidence that JC effects act also on offspring that become reproductive and persist as adults for many decades, a key requirement in assessing the role of postdispersal processes in shaping population and community dynamics.

TI  - Integrating ecological feedbacks across scales and levels of organization
PY  - 2024
AB  - <jats:p>In ecosystems, species interact in various ways with other species, and with their local environment. In addition, ecosystems are coupled in space by diverse types of flows. From these links connecting different ecological entities can emerge circular pathways of indirect effects: feedback loops. This contributes to creating a nested set of ecological feedbacks operating at different organizational levels as well as spatial and temporal scales in ecological systems: organisms modifying and being affected by their local abiotic environment, demographic and behavioral feedbacks within populations and communities, and spatial feedbacks occurring at the landscape scale. Here, we review how ecological feedbacks vary in space and time, and discuss the emergent properties they generate such as species coexistence or the spatial heterogeneity and stability of ecological systems. With the aim of identifying similarities across scales, we identify the abiotic and biotic modulators that can change the sign and strength of feedback loops and show that these feedbacks can interact in space or time. Our review shows that despite acting at different scales and emerging from different processes, feedbacks generate similar macroscopic properties of ecological systems across levels of organization. Ultimately, our contribution emphasizes the need to integrate such feedbacks to improve our understanding of their joint effects on the dynamics, patterns, and stability of ecological systems.</jats:p>

TI  - Global patterns and drivers of plant-soil microbe interactions.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Plant-soil feedback (PSF) is an important mechanism determining plant community dynamics and structure. Understanding the geographic patterns and drivers of PSF is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying geographic plant diversity patterns. We compiled a large dataset containing 5969 observations of PSF from 202 studies to demonstrate the global patterns and drivers of PSF for woody and non-woody species. Overall, PSF was negative on average and was influenced by plant attributes and environmental settings. Woody species PSFs did not vary with latitude, but non-woody PSFs were more negative at higher latitudes. PSF was consistently more positive with increasing aridity for both woody and non-woody species, likely due to increased mutualistic microbes relative to soil-borne pathogens. These findings were consistent between field and greenhouse experiments, suggesting that PSF variation can be driven by soil legacies from climates. Our findings call for caution to use PSF as an explanation of the latitudinal diversity gradient and highlight that aridity can influence plant community dynamics and structure across broad scales through mediating plant-soil microbe interactions.

TI  - Intraspecific variation in Janzen-Connell effect is mediated by stress and plant-soil feedbacks.
PY  - 2024
AB  - Janzen-Connell (JC) effects, hypothesized to be partially driven by negative plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs), are considered to be a key mechanism that regulates tropical forest plant diversity and coexistence. However, intraspecific variation in JC effects may weaken this mechanism, with the strength of PSFs being a potentially key variable process. We conducted a manipulated experiment with seedlings from two populations of <i>Pometia pinnata</i> (Sapindaceae), a tropical tree species in southwest China. We aimed to measure the intraspecific difference in PSF magnitude caused by inoculating the soil from different <i>P. pinnata</i> source populations and growing seedlings under differing light intensity and water availability treatments, and at varying plant densities. We found negative PSFs for both populations with the inoculum soil originating from the same sites, but PSFs differed significantly with the inoculum soil from different sites. PSF strength responded differently to biotic and abiotic drivers; PSF strength was weaker in low moisture and high light treatments than in high moisture and low light treatments. Our study documents intraspecific variation in JC effects: specifically, <i>P. pinnata</i> have less defenses to their natively-sourced soil, but are more defensive to the soil feedbacks from soil sourced from other populations. Our results imply that drought and light intensity tended to weaken JC effects, which may result in loss of species diversity with climate change.

TI  - Neighborhood diversity of large trees shows independent species patterns in a mixed dipterocarp forest in Sri Lanka
PY  - 2015
AB  - Interactions among neighboring individuals influence plant performance and should create spatial patterns in local community structure. In order to assess the role of large trees in generating spatial patterns in local species richness, we used the individual species-area relationship (ISAR) to evaluate the species richness of trees of different size classes (and dead trees) in circular neighborhoods with varying radius around large trees of different focal species. To reveal signals of species interactions, we compared the ISAR function of the individuals of focal species with that of randomly selected nearby locations. We expected that large trees should strongly affect the community structure of smaller trees in their neighborhood, but that these effects should fade away with increasing size class. Unexpectedly, we found that only few focal species showed signals of species interactions with trees of the different size classes and that this was less likely for less abundant focal species. However, the few and relatively weak departures from independence were consistent with expectations of the effect of competition for space and the dispersal syndrome on spatial patterns. A noisy signal of competition for space found for large trees built up gradually with increasing life stage; it was not yet present for large saplings but detectable for intermediates. Additionally, focal species with animal-dispersed seeds showed higher species richness in their neighborhood than those with gravity- and gyration-dispersed seeds. Our analysis across the entire ontogeny from recruits to large trees supports the hypothesis that stochastic effects dilute deterministic species interactions in highly diverse communities. Stochastic dilution is a consequence of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity in species-rich communities where the identities of the nearest neighbors of a given plant are largely unpredictable. While the outcome of local species interactions is governed for each plant by deterministic fitness and niche differences, the large variability of competitors causes also a large variability in the outcomes of interactions and does not allow for strong directed responses at the species level. Collectively, our results highlight the critical effect of the stochastic geometry of biodiversity in structuring local spatial patterns of tropical forest diversity.

TI  - Soil microbial communities influence seedling growth of a rare conifer independent of plant-soil feedback.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Plant-soil feedback, the reciprocal relationship between a plant and its associated microbial communities, has been proposed to be an important driver of plant populations and community dynamics. While rarely considered, understanding how plant-soil feedback contributes to plant rarity may have implications for conservation and management of rare species. Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis) is a critically endangered species, of which fewer than 100 trees are known to exist in the wild. Seedling survival within the first year after germination and subsequent recruitment of Wollemi pine is limited in the wild. We used a plant-soil feedback approach to investigate the functional effect of species-specific differences previously observed in the microbial communities underneath adult Wollemi pine and a neighboring species, coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum), and also whether additional variation in microbial communities in the wild could impact seedling growth. There was no evidence for seedling growth being affected by tree species associated with soil inocula, suggesting that plant-soil feedbacks are not limiting recruitment in the natural population. However, there was evidence of fungal, but not bacterial, community variation impacting seedling growth independently of plant-soil feedbacks. Chemical (pH) and physical (porosity) soil characteristics were identified as potential drivers of the functional outcomes of these fungal communities. The empirical approach described here may provide opportunities to identify the importance of soil microbes to conservation efforts targeting other rare plant species and is also relevant to understanding the importance of soil microbes and plant-soil feedbacks for plant community dynamics more broadly.

TI  - Testing pathogen host specificity: a reciprocal field experiment in two types of tropical forest on Hainan, China
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Janzen–Connell hypothesis suggests that highly specific pathogens decrease seedling survival close to the parent plant; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we tested the host specificity of soil pathogens to germinating seeds of Cyclobalanopsis fleuryi and Cryptocarya chinensis in tropical montane rain forest and cloud forest on Hainan, south China. Rhizospheric soils surrounding eight adult trees per species were collected in each forest type and divided into five soil treatments: parent, fungicide-sterilized, autoclave-sterilized, Fusarium-added and Pythium-added soils. Surface-sterilized seeds were sown in each of the five soil treatments and grown in two forest types. The seed germination percentages were significantly higher in sterilized soils (C. fleuryi, 41.5%; C. chinensis, 29.4%) than in non-sterilized soils (C. fleuryi, 28.3%; C. chinensis, 17.1%) in montane rain forest. The seed germination percentages in rhizospheric soil of conspecific parent trees were significantly lower in montane rain forest (C. fleuryi, 17.3%; C. chinensis, 10.5%) than in cloud forest (C. fleuryi, 37.1%; C. chinensis, 21.1%). Our results also suggest that the level of pathogen activity in each tree species varies depending on the environment. Our results support the hypothesis that host-specific pathogens shape tree species composition by differentially affecting seed germination under different environmental conditions.

TI  - Birth and life of tree aggregates in tropical forest: hypotheses on population dynamics of an aggregated shade-tolerant species
PY  - 2013
AB  - Questions: Several studies have described aggregated spatial patterns in tropical tree species. This study investigates aggregate dynamics of Vouacapoua americana (Aublet), a climax species whose spatial pattern is not simply related to light and soil conditions or to its short seed dispersal range. Location: Two rain forest sites: Nouragues and Paracou, in the Guiana Shield. Methods: We described the spatial pattern of tree locations and spatial autocorrelation of tree diameters, using statistics derived from Ripley's K. We particularly used methods to define analysis subplots according to local density or local mean diameter. We investigated relationships between spatial distributions of adults and saplings. Results: At both sites, populations of Vouacapoua demonstrated several nested levels of aggregation. Tree diameters were spatially autocorrelated, revealing the existence of clusters with similar diameters. In the largest aggregates, tree diameters declined from the centre to the edge. Regeneration was aggregated and occurred mainly at cluster edges and around rare isolated trees, and sapling densities and basal area of adults were negatively correlated. We show that long-distance dispersal events are rare. Conclusions: Environmental factors and seed dispersal only explain part of the observed spatial patterns. We provide two main hypotheses about Vouacapoua population dynamics. First, the lack of regeneration in aggregate centres results in the ageing of existing aggregates. We suggest that this lack of recruitment close to mature trees is due to a Janzen-Connell effect. However, aggregates can continue to grow along colonization fronts. Second, long-distance dispersal events allow the formation of new clusters and play a crucial role in the colonization process. We investigate aggregate dynamics of Vouacapoua americana (Aublet) whose spatial pattern is not simply related to environmental conditions or to its seed dispersal. Regeneration does not occur in centers of aggregate of adults. We suggest that rare long-distance dispersal events and density-dependence predation of seeds and seedlings play a crucial role in formation of new clusters and structuration of larger aggregates.

TI  - Effects of tree sex, maturity, local abiotic, and biotic neighborhoods on the growth of a subtropical dioecious tree species Diospyros morrisiana.
PY  - 2023
AB  - <AbstractText Label="PREMISE">Understanding the drivers of the growth in long-lived woody trees is the key to predicting their responses to and maintaining their populations under global change. However, the role of tree sex and differential investment to reproduction are often not considered in models of individual tree growth, despite many gymnosperm and angiosperm species having separate male and female sexes. Thus, better models of tree growth should include tree sex and life stage along with the abiotic and biotic neighborhoods.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We used a sex-specific molecular marker to determine the sex of 2188 individual trees &gt;1 cm DBH of the dioecious tree species Diospyros morrisiana in a 50-ha subtropical forest plot in China. We used long-term census data from about 300,000 trees, together with 625 soil samples and 2352 hemispherical photographs to characterize the spatially explicit biotic and abiotic neighborhoods.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">We found a male-biased effective sex ratio and a female-biased overall population sex ratio of D. morrisiana. No sex spatial segregation was detected for the overall population, mature, or immature trees. Immature trees grew faster than mature trees and females grew slower than males. Further, conspecific neighbors significantly decreased tree growth, while the abiotic neighborhood showed no significant effect.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">Our findings suggest that variation in resource allocation patterns within and across individual trees of different sexes and life-history stages should be more widely accounted for in models of tree growth. In addition, our study highlights the importance of sex-specific molecular markers for studying populations of long-lived dioecious tree species.</AbstractText>

TI  - Consequences of Seed Dispersal for Plant Recruitment in Tropical Forests: Interactions Within the Seedscape
PY  - 2013
AB  - Seed dispersal sets the stage for the suite of biotic and abiotic interactions that determine the fate of individual seeds. In this review, we first focus on how dispersal influences the ‘seedscape’, or the combination of abiotic and biotic factors that affect the probability of recruitment once a seed has reached its final location. We review recent papers that examine the effect of different dispersal vectors on (1) the quality of the habitat in which a seed lands; (2) the distance seeds are dispersed from the parent tree; and (3) the density and composition of plants within the neighborhood of a seed following deposition. Next, we explore methods used to scale these processes up to the level of populations. We highlight demographic models that integrate across multiple life history stages and predict the impact of dispersal in variable environments on population growth. We also review studies that analyze existing spatial patterns of trees within large forest plots and use various strategies to infer the processes that led to those patterns. We continue to scale up from populations to communities, and discuss approaches that have been taken to understand how dispersal may affect diversity and abundance in the community. We then turn to human disturbances and discuss the implications of frugivore defaunation for plant communities. We finish by highlighting several areas of research that are particularly promising for future directions of study.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Plant pathogens and herbivores can maintain forest diversity by reducing survival of tree seedlings close to conspecifics.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>In field surveys and the field experiment, insect damage on <jats:italic>T. sebifera</jats:italic> seedlings decreased with distance to conspecific trees in the native range (China), but damage was low at all distances in the introduced range (United States).

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Our findings indicate that both insect herbivores and the soil biota contribute to distance‐dependent effects on <jats:italic>T. sebifera</jats:italic> in its native range. They suggest, however, that plants may more readily escape herbivore than soil biota distance‐dependent effects when introduced to a new range and so herbivores, rather than soil pathogens, contribute more strongly to biogeographic variation in distance‐dependent effects. These results highlight the importance of considering species biogeographic variation in distance‐dependent effects and teasing apart the roles that different natural enemies play when studying species coexistence, community diversity and biological invasions.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Conspecific and heterospecific plant–soil feedbacks influence survivorship and growth of temperate tree seedlings
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary


1. The Janzen–Connell (J–C) Model proposes that host-specific enemies could maintain high tree species diversity by reducing seedling performance near conspecific adults. An implicit, but untested assumption of the J–C Model is that negative conspecific feedbacks would promote replacement by heterospecific seedlings.



2. In a glasshouse experiment, we tested plant–soil feedbacks as a J–C mechanism in four temperate tree species. We assessed effects of conspecific- relative to heterospecific-cultured soil extracts on seedling survival, total mass and performance for each focal species. To test the implicit assumption of replacement by heterospecific seedlings, we also compared relative performance of conspecific versus heterospecific seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by a particular tree species. We also tested whether soil microbes caused these plant–soil feedbacks and whether low irradiance increased seedling vulnerability to pathogens.



3. When grown with conspecific versus heterospecific soil extract, Acer rubrum mass decreased, Quercus rubra mass increased and Fraxinus americana increased survival. Conspecific extract reduced Acer saccharum mass in low light but increased it in high light. To integrate survival and growth, we examined seedling performance [(mean total mass × mean survival time)/(days of experiment)] at low and high light. In conspecific versus heterospecific soil extract, seedling performance was lower in two, higher in four and neutral in 18 of 24 cases, suggesting no advantage to dispersing away from conspecifics. Based on relative seedling performance within a soil extract, conspecific seedlings were disadvantaged in two, favoured in three and neutral in 19 of 24 cases relative to heterospecific seedlings.



4. Species pairwise interactions of soil modification and seedling performance were chemically mediated, occurring regardless of sterilization. Microbes lacked host specificity and reduced performance regardless of extract source. Additionally, microbial factors reduced seedling performance for Q. rubra regardless of light availability, and for A. rubrum and F. americana only in high light.



5. Synthesis. These chemical-mediated plant–soil feedbacks probably influence community dynamics, but are inconsistent with the J–C Model. Even when a species’ seedlings responded more negatively to conspecific than heterospecific soil, heterospecific seedlings were not necessarily favoured in that species’ soil, precluding heterospecific replacement as an explanation for coexistence.

TI  - EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF PLANT DISEASES IN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS
PY  - 2002
AB  - Plant pathogens cause mortality and reduce fecundity of individual plants, drive host population dynamics, and affect the structure and composition of natural plant communities. Pathogens are responsible for both numerical changes in host populations and evolutionary changes through selection for resistant genotypes. Linking such ecological and evolutionary dynamics has been the focus of a growing body of literature on the effects of plant diseases in natural ecosystems. A guiding principle is the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which plants and pathogens interact. This review summarizes the effects of diseases on populations of wild plants, focusing in particular on the mediation of plant competition and succession, the maintenance of plant species diversity, as well as the process of rapid evolutionary changes in host-pathogen symbioses.

TI  - Bringing the Mechanistic Approach Back to Life: A Systematic Review of the Experimental Evidence for Coexistence and Four of Its Classical Mechanisms
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:p>Coexistence theories develop rapidly at the ecology forefront suffering from interdisciplinary gaps and a lack of universality. The modern coexistence theory (MCT) was developed to address these deficiencies by formulating the universal conditions for coexistence. However, despite this theory's mechanistic foundation, initially, it has only rarely been used to determine the exact mechanisms that govern the competitive outcome. Recent theoretical developments have made MCT more accessible to experimentalists, but they can be challenging in practice. We propose that a comprehensive understanding of species co-occurrence patterns in nature can be reached by complementing the phenomenological approach with both the mechanistic view of MCT and coexistence experiments of the type that prevailed from the 1970s to the 2010s, which focused on specific mechanisms (designated the “mechanistic approach”). As a first step in this direction, we conducted a systematic review of the literature from 1967 to 2020, covering mechanistic experiments for invasibility—the criterion for species coexistence—and the best-studied classical coexistence mechanisms, namely, resource-ratio, natural enemy partitioning, frequency-dependent exploitation by generalist enemies, and the storage effect. The goals of the review were to evaluate (i) the percentage of the abovementioned mechanistic experiments that satisfy the theoretical criteria (designated “eligible studies”), (ii) the scope of these eligible studies, and (iii) their level of support for the theoretical predictions, and to identify their (iv) overarching implications and (v) research gaps. Through examination of 2,510 publications, the review reveals that almost 50 years after the theoretical formulations of the above four coexistence mechanisms, we still lack sufficient evidence to reveal the prevalence of coexistence and of each of the coexistence mechanisms, and to assess the dependency of the mechanisms on the natural history of the competing organisms. By highlighting, on the one hand, the overarching implications of the mechanistic approach to coexistence, and on the other hand, current research gaps, and by offering ways to bridge these gaps in the future, we seek to bring the mechanistic approach back to life.</jats:p>

PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Negative plant–soil feedback can cause density and distance effects that lead to Janzen–Connell (JC) distribution. The JC hypothesis has been proposed to explain the high species diversity in tropical forests, but it has been rarely tested in species‐rich Mediterranean shrublands. In this study, we assessed whether the JC hypothesis could explain <jats:italic>Euphorbia dendroides</jats:italic> recruitment pattern under conspecific conditions, that is, mother plant and the canopy of <jats:italic>Pistacia lentiscus</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Juniperus phoenicea</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Myrtus communis</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Olea europaea</jats:italic>. We examined whether soil chemistry and/or soil microbiota, characterized by both bacterial and fungal communities, explained the observed JC pattern. We also explored differences in microclimate among shrub species by monitoring air temperature and light availability at different times of the year. <jats:italic>Euphorbia</jats:italic> recruits were almost absent under the canopy of conspecifics, being more abundant at the edge of the canopy, which fits the JC pattern. Interestingly, we also found a high density of <jats:italic>Euphorbia</jats:italic> recruitment under heterospecific canopies, that is, <jats:italic>O. europaea</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>J. phoenicea</jats:italic>, but a very low density under other heterospecific canopies, for example, <jats:italic>R. officinalis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. lentiscus</jats:italic>. Although shrubs have a species‐specific microbiota signature under their canopy, neither the accumulation of species‐specific pathogens nor soil chemical properties explain the observed JC pattern. Despite finding that shrubs buffer high temperatures in summer, the observed microclimatic difference failed to explain the recruitment pattern. We conclude that JC is prevalent in this species‐rich Mediterranean shrubland, but the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated and clarified.</jats:p>

TI  - Variation in biotic interactions mediates the effects of masting and rainfall fluctuations on seedling demography in a subtropical rainforest
PY  - 2022
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Seedling dynamics are critical for determining community composition and future forest structure. Two mechanisms are crucial drivers of seedling vital rates: biotic interactions and environmental filtering. Biotic interactions at the neighbourhood scale, such as the Janzen–Connell effect, are considered among the main mechanisms maintaining species coexistence. These effects can show considerable temporal variation because of changes in neighbourhood density (i.e. seedling recruitment following masting years) and weather conditions. However, there is limited evidence of whether interannual variation in these conditions modulates biotic interactions and its potential cascading effects on seedling vital rates.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We used seedling data collected over 17 years in a subtropical rainforest in northern Taiwan. We modelled interannual variation in first‐year survival and growth of 12,830 seedlings of 36 species and 47 cohorts using (generalized) linear mixed‐effects models with several crowding indices and abiotic conditions (edaphic and topographic factors) as predictors.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The first‐year seedling survival and growth depended on both weather conditions and neighbourhood density. Seedling survival was greater when recruitment was more abundant and in years with greater rainfall, and this was mostly mediated by the interaction with conspecific and heterospecific seedlings. Seedling growth decreased with the increasing abundance of new recruits and increased with annual rainfall. Growth was negatively affected by the basal area of conspecific and heterospecific trees and by the density of conspecific seedlings when the number of new recruits was greater. The abiotic factors had a limited effect on seedling survival and growth compared to biotic factors.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our results show that variation in recruitment abundance due to masting and annual rainfall significantly affects seedling vital rates by changing biotic interactions. These findings are in accordance with the economy of scale hypothesis, which predicts higher per‐capita reproductive success in years of higher seed production. Furthermore, the results support the hypothesis that fluctuations in rainfall can alter biotic interactions in forests. Efforts to predict forest community responses to climate changes should consider the temporal variations in biotic interactions.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

TI  - Why are there so many species in the tropics
PY  - 2013
AB  - Known for centuries, the geographical pattern of increasing biodiversity from the poles to the equator is one of the most pervasive features of life on Earth. A longstanding goal of biogeographers has been to understand the primary factors that generate and maintain high diversity in the tropics. Many ‘historical’ and ‘ecological’ hypotheses have been proposed and debated, but there is still little consensus. Recent discussions have centred around two main phenomena: phylogenetic niche conservatism and ecological productivity. These two factors play important roles, but accumulating theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the single most important factor is kinetics: the temperature dependence of ecological and evolutionary rates. The relatively high temperatures in the tropics generate and maintain high diversity because ‘the Red Queen runs faster when she is hot’.

TI  - Movement Strategies of Seed Predators as Determinants of Plant Recruitment Patterns
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract: Plant recruitment in nature exhibits several distinctive patterns ranging from hump shaped to monotonically decreasing with distance from the seed source. We investigate the role of postdispersal seed predation in shaping these patterns, introducing a new mechanistic model that explicitly accounts for the movement strategy used by seed eaters. The model consists of two partial differential equations describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of both seed and predator densities. The movement strategy is defined by how predators move in response to the different cues they can use to search for seeds. These cues may be seed density, seed intake, distance from the plant, density of conspecific foragers, or a mixture of these four. The model is able to reproduce all the basic plant recruitment patterns found in the field. We compare the results to those of the ideal free distribution (IFD) theory and show that hump‐shaped plant recruitment patterns cannot be generated by IFD predators and, in general, by...

TI  - Foliar damage beyond species distributions is partly explained by distance dependent interactions with natural enemies
PY  - 2016
AB  - Plant distributions are expected to shift in response to climate change, and range expansion dynamics will be shaped by the performance of individuals at the colonizing front. These plants will encounter new biotic communities beyond their range edges, and the net outcome of these encounters could profoundly affect colonization success. However, little is known about how biotic interactions vary across range edges and this has hindered efforts to predict changes in species distributions in response to climate change. In contrast, a rich literature documents how biotic interactions within species ranges vary according to distance to and density of conspecific individuals. Here, we test whether this framework can be extended to explain how biotic interactions differ beyond range edges, where conspecific adults are basically absent. To do so, we planted seven species of trees along a 450-km latitudinal gradient that crossed the current distributional range of five of these species and monitored foliar disease and invertebrate herbivory over 5 yr. Foliar disease and herbivory were analyzed as a function of distance to and density of conspecific and congeneric trees at several spatial scales. We found that within species ranges foliar disease was lower for seedlings that were farther from conspecific adults for Acer rubrum, Carya glabra, Quercus alba, and Robinia pseudoacacia. Beyond range edges, there was even less foliar disease for C. glabra, Q. alba, and R. pseudoacacia (A. rubrum was not planted outside its range). Liriodendron tulipifera did not experience reduced disease within or beyond its range. In contrast, Quercus velutina displayed significant but idiosyncratic patterns in disease at varying distances from conspecifics. Patterns of distance dependent herbivory across spatial scales was generally weak and in some cases negative (i.e., seedlings farther from conspecific adults had more herbivory). Overall, we conclude that differences in biotic interactions across range edges can be thought of as a spatial extension to the concept of distance dependent biotic interactions. This framework also provides the basis for general predictions of how distance dependent biotic interactions will change across range edges in other systems.

TI  - Negative plant‐soil feedbacks increase with plant abundance, and are unchanged by competition
PY  - 2016
AB  - Plant-soil feedbacks and interspecific competition are ubiquitous interactions that strongly influence the performance of plants. Yet few studies have examined whether the strength of these interactions corresponds with the abundance of plant species in the field, or whether feedbacks and competition interact in ways that either ameliorate or exacerbate their effects in isolation. We sampled soil from two intermountain grassland communities where we also measured the relative abundance of plant species. In greenhouse experiments, we quantified the direction and magnitude of plant-soil feedbacks for 10 target species that spanned a range of abundances in the field. In soil from both sites, plant-soil feedbacks were mostly negative, with more abundant species suffering greater negative feedbacks than rare species. In contrast, the average response to competition for each species was unrelated with its abundance in the field. We also determined how competitive response varied among our target species when plants competed in live vs. sterile soil. Interspecific competition reduced plant size, but the strength of this negative effect was unchanged by plant-soil feedbacks. Finally, when plants competed interspecifically, we asked how conspecific-trained, heterospecific-trained, and sterile soil influenced the competitive responses of our target species and how this varied depending on whether target species were abundant or rare in the field. Here, we found that both abundant and rare species were not as harmed by competition when they grew in heterospecific-trained soil compared to when they grew in conspecific-cultured soil. Abundant species were also not as harmed by competition when growing in sterile vs. conspecific-trained soil, but this was not the case for rare species. Our results suggest that abundant plants accrue species-specific soil pathogens to a greater extent than rare species. Thus, negative feedbacks may be critical for preventing abundant species from becoming even more abundant than rare species.

TI  - The use and abuse of keystone plant species in restoration practices of terrestrial ecosystems
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>Keystone plant species are commonly used for restoring degraded terrestrial sites because, despite being encountered in low abundances in natural communities, they interact with multiple species across multiple niche dimensions. Nevertheless, the demographic characteristics of these “great interactors” are often disregarded in restoration planning, which may bring unintended consequences for restoration trajectories once the outcome of species relationships interplays between positive and negative effects depending on the density of interacting species. Therefore, while replanting keystone species at their characteristically low densities may re‐entangle food webs and allow novel plant and animal recruitment, restoring them at high densities can assemble asymmetrical relationships strong enough to affect sympatric plant species establishment, survival, and reproduction. Here, we explore the negative consequences of overusing keystone plant species in sites undergoing restoration and provide specific guidelines for practitioners to maximize the benefits of keystone plants in restoration initiatives.</jats:p>

TI  - The interacting effects of clumped seed dispersal and distance- and density-dependent mortality on seedling recruitment patterns
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. Seed dispersal and natural enemies both influence spatial patterns of seedlings, which in turn influence future abiotic and biotic interactions, with consequences for plant populations, distributions and diversity. Clumped seed deposition is common, especially for vertebrate-dispersed seeds, and has the potential to significantly affect interactions with density-responsive enemies, yet has received relatively little attention. 2. We used spatially explicit simulation models to examine how different patterns of seed dispersal and natural enemy attack structure seedling spatial patterns. We simulated clumped seed dispersal by combining a two-dimensional Student’s T dispersal kernel for expected seed rain with a negative binomial distribution for seed deposition. We based our models for seed mortality on published data reflecting differing life histories of insect seed predators and soil-borne pathogens. We varied dispersal distance, degree of clumping, type of enemy, enemy dispersal distance and fecundity among simulations. 3. Under insect seed predation, seeds escaped predation by dispersing longer distances than insects, resulting in ‘Janzen–Connell’ patterns in which seedling recruitment peaks at intermediate distances. When insects dispersed longer distances than seeds, higher seed densities near the tree satiated insects, resulting in ‘McCanny’ patterns in which seed deposition, survivorship and seedling establishment all decrease with distance from the parent tree. Total seedling establishment was lowest when insects and seeds dispersed similar distances. 4. Under pathogen attack, Janzen–Connell patterns predominated except when seedling survival was virtually zero or one everywhere, or in the case where pathogen dispersal distances exceeded seed dispersal distances, producing ‘Hubbell’ patterns in which seed deposition and seedling establishment decrease with distance, though survivorship increases. 5. Clumped seed deposition increased the probability of seedling establishment under both insect seed predation and pathogen attack as it led to local satiation of insect seed predators and made it harder for pathogen distributions to track seeds. 6. Synthesis. Our modelling study suggests that the relative dispersal distances of seeds and natural enemies are crucial to determining establishment rates and spatial patterns of seedlings. Better characterization of the movement and natural histories of natural enemies is critical to improving our understanding of seedling distributions and plant–enemy interactions.

TI  - Host-specific soil microbes contribute to habitat restriction of closely related oaks (Quercus spp.).
PY  - 2022
AB  - Habitat divergence among close relatives is a common phenomenon. Studying the mechanisms behind habitat divergence is fundamental to understanding niche partitioning, species diversification, and other evolutionary processes. Recent studies found that soil microbes regulate the abundance and diversity of plant species. However, it remains unclear whether soil microbes can affect the habitat distributions of plants and drive habitat divergence. To fill in this knowledge gap, we investigated whether soil microbes might restrict habitat distributions of closely related oaks (<i>Quercus</i> spp.) in eastern North America. We performed a soil inoculum experiment using two pairs of sister species (i.e., the most closely related species) that show habitat divergence: <i>Quercus alba</i> (local species) vs. <i>Q. michauxii</i> (foreign), and <i>Q. shumardii</i> (local) vs. <i>Q. acerifolia</i> (foreign). To test whether host-specific soil microbes are responsible for habitat restriction, we investigated the impact of local sister live soil (containing soil microbes associated with local sister species) on the survival and growth of local and foreign species. Second, to test whether habitat-specific soil microbes are responsible for habitat restriction, we examined the effect of local habitat live soil (containing soil microbes within local sister's habitats, but not directly associated with local sister species) on the seedlings of local and foreign species. We found that local sister live soil decreased the survival and biomass of foreign species' seedlings while increasing those of local species, suggesting that host-specific soil microbes could potentially mediate habitat exclusion. In contrast, local habitat live soil did not differentially affect the survival or biomass of the local vs. foreign species. Our study indicates that soil microbes associated with one sister species can suppress the recruitment of the other host species, contributing to the habitat partitioning of close relatives. Considering the complex interactions with soil microbes is essential for understanding the habitat distributions of closely related plants.

TI  - The effects of individual tree species on species diversity in a tropical dry forest change throughout ontogeny
PY  - 2015
AB  - Understanding how diversity is maintained in species-rich communities, such as tropical forests, remains a challenge in ecology. Recent work suggests that the controversy between competing theories could be better resolved by considering the spatial scale at which different processes rule community assembly.



Here we use individual species–area relationships (ISAR) to evaluate the spatial organization of tree diversity around individuals of different species in a completely-mapped tropical dry forest in south Ecuador. We test two hypotheses. First, stressful environmental conditions promote facilitative interactions that will generate spatial signals of accumulation of diversity around individual trees – contrary to what has been reported in humid tropical forests. Second, spatial signals will shift through ontogeny. As, as larger, older trees generate new microsite conditions that affect the recruitment of younger, smaller trees.



We compute ISAR functions for adult trees, for young trees and a new crossed-ISAR function measuring the accumulation of diversity of young trees around the old trees. We compare observed ISARs to the expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson (i.e. null) models controlling for the effects of environmental variation and habitat association on tree distribution.



Although the prevalent response among adult trees was not different from null expectations, which means that the organization of diversity in this size class could be explained by environmental heterogeneity alone, most species accumulated more diversity than expected over short spatial scales in the small stem size class. Only two species accumulated significant diversity in the crossed-ISARs. Our study indicates the role of facilitation in the organization of plant diversity in this dry forest, but that facilitation is limited to some key species acting on early life stages and accumulating diversity around them.



Our results demonstrate the benefit of considering different life-stages and crossed analyses to disentangle the processes affecting community assembly in tropical dry forests.

TI  - Effects of tree species diversity and conspecific seedling density on insect herbivory and pathogen infection on big‐leaf mahogany seedlings
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:p>The Janzen–Connell hypothesis (JCH) predicts that attack by specialist enemies on seedlings increases with conspecific seedling density, but studies have rarely experimentally tested for the contingency of such effects on the tree community context (e.g. diversity, composition) ormeasured responses by different enemies (e.g. herbivores, pathogens). We conducted a field study in a large‐scale system evaluating tree species diversity and conspecific density effects on leaf damage on mahogany <jats:italic>Swietenia macrophylla</jats:italic> seedlings. We established quadrats of eight levels of seedling density across mahogany tree monocultures and tree species polycultures including mahogany, and recorded percent leaf damage by insects and percent leaf necrosis by a pathogenic fungus on mahogany seedlings. We found contrasting effects of tree species diversity on insects and pathogens. Whereas tree diversity did not affect leaf damage by insects, it had a significant negative effect on leaf necrosis by pathogens whereby, on average, percent leaf necrosis on mahogany seedlings in polyculture was half of that observed in monoculture. We discuss the potential influences of changes in mahogany tree density versus frequency (relative to other tree species) driving this diversity effect. Unexpectedly, we found no effect of seedling conspecific density on either leaf insect or pathogen damage (i.e. density‐independent attack). Likewise, we found no significant tree diversity by seedling density interaction, indicating that plant enemies were consistently unresponsive to variation in seedling density acrosslevels of tree diversity. Overall, this study provides a unique test of the JCH by experimentally evaluating seedling density and tree diversity effects on contrasting plant enemies and, in turn, the controls they exert over plant recruitment.</jats:p>

TI  - Plant-soil feedback: incorporating untested influential drivers and reconciling terminology
PY  - 2023
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Plants condition the soil in which they grow, thereby altering the performance of subsequent plants growing in this soil. This phenomenon, known as plant-soil feedback (PSF), has garnered increasing interest. Experiments are moving from single species soil pairings in the glasshouse to community-level field trials. Consequently, our knowledge of the role PSF plays in shaping ecosystem functions has advanced. However, knowledge gaps remain.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Scope</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Here, we explore intrinsic and extrinsic abiotic and biotic drivers of PSF such as maternal effects, plant functional traits, self-DNA, plant-plant competition, herbivory, interactions between soil organisms, temperature, drought, flooding, greenhouse gases, (micro)nutrients, plant-litter-soil feedback and priority effects. These drivers have begun to feature in experiments, thereby increasing our mechanistic understanding of PSF. Nonetheless, many of these topics have received insufficient coverage to determine general principles across larger temporal and spatial scales. Further, conflicting terminology has excluded PSF studies from reviews and meta-analyses. We review terms such as soil sickness, Janzen-Connell hypothesis, soil-related invasive species work, soil legacies, allelopathy and soil-related succession that overlap with PSF but are generally not named as such.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Holistic experimental designs that consider the continual reciprocal feedback between the extrinsic environment, plants and soil, as well as the unification of terminologies are necessary if we are to realise the full potential of PSF for understanding and steering ecosystem processes. Here, we compile outstanding questions related to PSF research that emphasis the aforementioned topics and suggest ways to incorporate them into future research in order to advance plant-soil ecology.</jats:p>
