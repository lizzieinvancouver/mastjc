\section{Outline plus homeless notes}

Janzen-Connell (conspecific negative density dependence CNDD) -- spatial density dependence that leads to coexistence; and masting (insert definition)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Outline the dichotomy between these fields (parallel literatures): 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Similar processes: both focused on density dependence (in trees)
\item Both focused on ways to escape pathogens (via space, JC ... and via time masting).
\item Different dimensions: JC focused on space, masting focused on times.
\item Different outcomes assumed
\begin{enumerate}
\item JC is focused on negative DD and masting is focused on positive DD (but the masting is probably cycling over time between positive and negative). 
\end{enumerate}
\item Transition: JC studies have no time, only space, and EOS Masting have looked over time. So both fields of study have ignored one important axes (either of space or time), which means it is difficult to understand the entire landscape
\end{enumerate}
\item What would happen if we brought them together? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Insert 3D time-space-pressure figure and predictions. 
\item Highlight the Spatial and temporal scale of pathogens/consumers. (Add to host specificity... people need to include this in empirical tests.) When masting works depends on this AND the host specificity. Predict spatial scale of synchrony and depending on the generation time/mobility of consumers. Do JC and/or masting make implicit assumptions of mobility and generation time of consumers that each make? 
\end{enumerate}
\item Things that might get resolved
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hey, you guys explaining masting, could help explain community diversity. And you guys explaining community diversity could explain masting. 
\item Masting people -- are REALLY interested in why trees mast (and how it matters to consumers) and maybe this could all connect to rarity/commonness and coexistence. 
\item Plant soil feedbacks ... somehow
\item Latitudinal gradients? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item JC helps explain latitudinal gradient, but evidence is pretty weak; if masting is more prevalent in northern latitudes, then you might resolve this lack of evidence by ...
\item if masting species are more prevalent outside the tropics then they escape CNDD and this explains latitudinal gradient in diversity (but -- you may think, `hey there's no evidence of less CNDD in temperate' and we say -- people have not looked at space and time properly)
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Outstanding questions ...
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is supposed to happen with JC over time? (JC should consider temporal aspect more)
\item Is masting as a way to escape JC? JC means whatever is common gets attacked, so if you mast you can avoid this and stay common. Most tropical forest communities are dominated by a couple species, so we predict they mast? 
\item What are the evolutionary implications of JC: Masting is a strategy to escape pathogens, JC you're stuck with pathogens and escape in space -- the strategy then should be to evolve dispersal (back to animal dispersal)... 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Notes from 8 May 2024 meeting at KWEER without a home}

Stuff related to what each field needs to do and/or what we want people to do after reading this paper
\begin{enumerate}
\item pull masting to community perspective ... needs phylogeny and pulls towards pest/pathogen host specificity 
\item  Both JC and masting should care more about host specificity of pathogens (with phylogeny of hosts)
\item JC people should think if masting explains anything. 
\item Stop measuring saplings only; look at germinants. 
\item So JC should consider temporal aspect more (from above) 
\item Develop modeling tools that have space and time.
\end{enumerate}


Semi-crazy ideas ... 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If there is phylogenetic signal in pest/pathogen host range then it would select for masting synchrony in those species; so phylogenetic signal currently observed in masting would be RECENTLY evolved (convergent evolution, not common ancestor) ... assumes species overlap in geographic ranges and co-occurrence in a community. 
\item Related to why masting might be more prevalent in temperate zone (is it?) 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  It's easier to develop cues for masting in seasonal habitats? Evolutionary inertia of seasonal cues makes it easier to evolve masting cues? 
\item Seasonality slows down build of soil pathogens after masting? Is it easier to burn out pathogens in the tropics when the pathogens may be less likely to have dormancy stages. So could seasonal (within-year) seed production in the tropics be masting (burns out pathogens) effectively? And thus people don't fully recognize masting in tropics? MERGE this with, is it easier to evolve masting if you're seasonal already.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Masting (an economy of scale) -- predicts positive density dependence over time  
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you are doing it asynchronously then you need host specificty.
\item If you do it synchronously you can have generalist consumers.
\item In between you can maybe less synchronous if hosts are phylogenetically distant. See Parker et al. 2015: `Phylogenetic structure and host abundance drive disease pressure in communities' which cites Janzen-Connell. 
\end{enumerate}

... both verbal models. They only focus on trees, because you need a longer generation time (seed to reproductive maturity) to be longer than the predators can cycle. (They JC people think it works beyond trees -- e.g., grasslands -- and work on trees only because it's cool to explain all the trees.)

% Leaving this out probably (conversation got nowhere): One EOS for masting is pollination efficiency (and does not intersect with JC). In the tropics everything is animal pollinated maybe because (1) rarity, (2) trees have leaves all the time so no wind work and (3). See Annual Review: % https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.002433

% JC says many species in tropics because so many specialized consumers (pathogens) ... and CNDD is stronger in tropics, but now we say little CNDD in temperate zone. (Not sure what I meant here)

\section{Figures}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Look at citations from each foundational paper in field (Janzen and Connell's separate papers, then Janzen's masting paper) and see how much they cite across the two literatures. 
\item 3D time-space-pressure: axes are: time since masting, space from mother tree and predator (pathogen) pressure. JC works across space to say that pressure is HIGH close to mother tree, masting says pressure is LOW in mast years ... but what about in between? Could also use this figure to highlight that JC focuses only on space and masting focuses only on time. 
\item Two separate figures: one for JC people which is seeds per m2 versus survival (spatial) and for the masting it's seeds per m2 versus survival and temporal
