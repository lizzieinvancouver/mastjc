This folder contains notes from me and Janneke meeting in Zurich in Nov 2024 (in person!). 
The aim was to work on text for how to test these hypothesis together for TREE paper led by JD (he asked us to work on this). 
I was slow to get this organized, so was pressured to send text to JD in later December (text below), which I gather he did not use much, but I also sent the SNSF and he said some lines in there were sort of useful.

See also chatsJanneke.txt for more info on visit and that file also includes this:

** TO DO items: 
- Janneke will check stuff, then send email about biblio (#1)
- Lizzie will start writing and let Janneke know she's working on it and Janneke will fix it
- Lizzie should someday work on the GEPHI figure (but needs Janneke to do #1 first)

TEXT that I SENT to JD on 19 Dec 2024

Testing for [this hypothesis//whether spatial Janzen-Connell dynamics may trade off with temporal masting dynamics//spatio-temporal density dependence] is possible given observational data of seed and seedling dynamics transformed into robust estimates of density dependence. Models for this are already widely used to test for JC dynamics, but rarely include the temporal component [but see some paper I found]. Thus, some tests of this hypothesis may be possible now, but robust tests require data across a gradient of seed abundance. If most tests of JC occur in areas with relatively stable seed abundance [I know, abundance is not the right word] over years, then we likely have poor data to fully test for the hypothesized trade-off.

In contrast to JC studies, masting studies often clearly examine years of high and low seed abundance, but need additional data to test for the hypothesized trade-off. Specifically, we hypothesize that high seed crop years produce years of positive density dependence but these should offset other years when negative density dependence may be prevalent. Collecting spatial data on seed crop and seed/seedling survival across years and space and combining it with equations to estimate density dependence from the JC literature could robustly test whether forests with masting operate under fundamentally density dependent dynamics than those dominated by JC dynamics---or whether they operate under JC dynamics in some years but these effects are swamped by positive DD in high seed crop years.

Testing these hypotheses together also requires teasing out density dependence of conspecific versus heterospecific species ...  JC is good at this; masting folks need to more clearly define which species share similar predators....

Experiments could also help test critical assumptions and predictions. While manipulating seed density in the field is difficult, studies can remove seed predators (either exclosures for vertebrate predators or use pots for exclusion of pathogens) and test for predicted trends in seed and seedling survival (see FIGURE?). ... something about masting and JC needing to do a big latitudinal study of soil/seed pathogen effects ... ?
